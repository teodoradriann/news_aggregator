    "title": "Kidnappers terrorising Ekiti are foreigners —Parent whose son escaped abduction",
    "text": "A farmer and resident of Eporo Ekiti in the Emure Local Government Area of Ekiti State, Mr Gabriel Omoniyi, whose 15 years old son, escaped being kidnapped on Monday by the abductors of schoolchildren and their teachers, in this interview with ABIODUN NEJO says it is the government that can rescue people from destructive work of gunmen.\nSince Monday when the kidnap incident took place along Emure – Eporo Road, how has life been at Eporo?\nWe are not happy because our minds are not at rest. All those abducted are residents of Eporo, both children and adults. We are not happy. We have been praying that God will touch their hearts and for the government to come to our aid so that the abductees can be rescued.\nHow many persons were abducted?\nThey are nine in all – four adults and five children. The adults included three teachers and the driver. None of them will be less than 40 years of age. The driver should be my age and I am about 56 years.\nHow did the incident happen?\nThe children were returning to Eporo from their school at Emure. The driver picks them up daily by 6am and returns them after school. It was when they got to an area not far away from Eporo that the incident happened. It should be around 5pm. The gunmen shot at the tyre of the bus. When the driver came out to see what happened, they appeared and attacked him. My 15 years old son was on the bus. He sat in the back seat and from that position could see what happened before the gunmen marched all the occupants out of the bus and ordered them to lie face down with their eyes closed. When the occupants had laid face down, the kidnappers started picking those they wanted to kidnap. It was when they had selected those they wanted that they marched them into the bush. They took away three children of the same mother, one woman and her child.\nMy son said that it was when he could not hear anything again that he opened his eyes to realize those people had gone. That was how others stood up. The number of people on the bus when the incident happened would be about 30. Because they were children, they were lapping one another. The older ones will lap the younger ones. It was at that point that they started running for their lives. My son was even among the ones who assisted the children in getting motorbikes to their houses from the place. We gathered that some okada operators on learning of the operation escaped for their lives, some even left their bikes on the road before they came to pick them up later.\nHow many were the kidnappers?\nMy son said they were eight in number and that they were suspected herders. He said that five of them carried AK 47 guns, while one of them carried the bullets on his head. My son saw them, it was daylight. My son and others pass the route daily to school, see policemen and checkpoints, and know the type of guns carried by policemen.\nWhat are the kidnappers still saying?\nThey called the parent of one of the children on Tuesday and demanded N10m ransom per abductee. It is the parents of the abductees that they are reaching out to. I know the situation will change. But there is no money in town, we are farmers. The person who took away the wife and child is a teacher in a public school. How much does a teacher earn monthly? The kidnapped wife is a teacher in a private school at Emure Ekiti. They live at Eporo here. We are at sea, it is the government we are looking up to for assistance in this matter.\nWe gathered that the people of Eporo are already contributing money to secure the release of the abductees…\nWe have taken that step, but how much will they contribute – N5,000, N1,000, N2,000, N10,000 – how much will these amount to? Some are willing to contribute but don’t have the capacity. I don’t know yet how much has been contributed.\nWhat steps has the school taken on the kidnap incident?\nIt is from the school that one can get better details, but I know they are not sleeping.\nWhat of police and other security agencies?\nPerhaps they have been to the parents of the abductees, but as the father of a lucky occupant of the bus, I have not seen any policeman. We have been in fear, of leaving home have been somehow since the incident.\nWe are not happy. Even when one parent of the children on the bus heard of the news, she fainted. It took some time to revive her and at the end of the day, her child was not among the ones kidnapped. We are one with all those abducted. We attend the same church, and nobody is happy.\nIs this the first time kidnappers struck in the area?\nThis was the first time they came to the road to operate. But last year, they were kidnapped in the reserve. One Hausa man who refused to follow the kidnappers was shot dead on June 3 last year.\nWhere is the reserve?\nThe reserve is at Eporo here. They cultivate watermelon there. They were harvesting watermelons that time when the gunmen invaded the place and asked of the owner of the farmland. The man that was killed came to buy watermelon which had been harvested the previous day. The man came in a chartered vehicle, everybody ran for their dear lives when the incident happened, but the man was unfortunate. After killing the man, the gunmen saw a labourer in the bush, and abducted him and the labourer was not released until he paid N300,000 ransom.\nWhat are you doing to arrest the situation of attacks on the farms?\nFulanis bororos are the ones terrorising us, destroying our farms to the extent that we are not at peace while on our farms. Strangely, herdsmen rearing cattle dress like people going to war. They have machetes and jack knives by their sides. Even when their cattle graze your farms, you would never dare ask or challenge them. They threaten with their arms. They had ‘ macheted’ some people for challenging them when farms were being grazed. Even if you have the opportunity to arrest them, everything always ends at the station. These evil-doers, if you look at it very well, are not Nigerians. The languages spoken by the Bororos are about four, some of them are even unintelligible to the Hausa people here. It is pitiable that they come from different countries to punish us and the government seems helpless. It is the government that can bail us out. We as farmers.\nWe are not allowed to move about with machetes and others, but the Fulanis are armed wherever they are with impunity. If government allows us to defend ourselves, it will be easy. Everybody will then be armed as well.\nDo you mean your farms in Eporo are being grazed?\nYes. As a person, my new oil palm farm was destroyed by their cows. We made noise, but nothing happened. Those that we cannot fight are better handed over to God.\nYou are a Yoruba man, some people are saying when things happen like this, it is a message to return to the traditional way…\nThat suggestion is okay. It is part of it. Look at the killing of two obas in Ekiti here on Monday, if things are as they used to be, can any bullet penetrate an oba’s body? Can anybody attack an Oba with a machete? It can never penetrate. I know of an Oba that if you shoot at his car, the bullets would not penetrate even when the car is not bulletproof! Even his dog cannot be killed with a bullet, but now, things have changed, it is politicians that install kings, not kingmakers. Politicians now install kings. People who have influence politically and are connected with politicians are the ones being installed kings now. They even invite some from abroad to be crowned kings.",

    "text": "Secciones Servicios Destacamos Inmaculada Acién El Ejido Jueves, 4 de abril 2024, 23:07 Necesitas ser suscriptor para acceder a esta funcionalidad. Compartir El Ayuntamiento de El Ejido, a través de la unidad de Juventud, Educación y Participación, ha puesto en marcha el programa 'Bienestar Juvenil', que durante los tres próximos meses va a estar conformado por tres talleres dirigidos a jóvenes a partir de 12 años con los que se busca trabajar la autoestima, el ciberacoso y las habilidades sociales. El concejal de Juventud, Javier Rodríguez, señaló al respecto que «el objetivo principal de estas propuestas es fomentar la autoconciencia, la empatía, la aceptación personal y la seguridad entre los adolescentes, un colectivo que está en continúo contacto con las redes sociales, para que reflexionen sobre su uso, promuevan la autenticidad y el reconocimiento de la realidad detrás de la vida digital y desarrollen habilidades de autorregulación para una utilización equilibrada de las redes sociales». Los cursos son de carácter gratuito, se van a llevar a cabo en el Espacio Murgijoven a cargo de la educadora social ejidense María Caravelo y para participar es necesaria inscripción previa online en la web municipal. En este sentido, el primero de los talleres arrancará el 17 y durará una semana, hasta el 24 de abril, en horario de 18 a 20 horas, bajo el título 'Conviértete en influencer creando los mejores challenges'. A través de esta atractiva propuesta, los jóvenes van a hacer diversos challenges, lo que va a permitir a los participantes exponerse de manera segura y asertiva mientras exploran sus capacidades y se desafían a sí mismos. «Se busca fomentar el trabajo en equipo, la creatividad y la capacidad de comunicación efectiva de los participantes desde una interacción respetuosa en línea», apuntó Rodríguez. El segundo curso tendrá lugar los días 8, 15 y 22 de mayo de 18 a 19.30 horas y consistirá en la realización de ejercicios prácticos de reconexión, autoconocimiento y empoderamiento que implican la creación de fotos y vídeos para diferentes plataformas sociales. «Pretendemos mejorar la autoestima y la resiliencia emocional de los jóvenes, ayudándoles a valorarse de manera positiva y a mantener una perspectiva realista en el mundo digital», incidió el concejal de Juventud y Educación en relación a este segundo curso. Por otra parte y en cuanto a la última de las propuestas para este próximo trimestre, se llevará a cabo los días 12 y 19 de junio en horario de 18 a 20 horas. El Espacio Murgijoven será escenario del taller 'Mememaster', para aprender a hacer los mejores 'memes', con el que los participantes aprenderán a utilizar el humor con inteligencia y asertividad desde una cultura de respeto y empatía en línea, con la finalidad de trabajar «el pensamiento crítico frente al uso de memes, brindando a los adolescentes herramientas para identificar y enfrentar el ciberacoso de manera constructiva y consciente», subrayó el concejal de Juventud.

    "text": "ROMA, 11 OTT – Maltempo addio. Dopo i primi 10 giorni di piogge intense e vento, grazie alla rimonta dell’alta pressione, tornano il sole e le temperature miti su tutta l’Italia. A confermare l’arrivo dell’ottobrata Antonio Sanò, fondatore de iLMeteo.it. “Nelle prossime ore – afferma – avremo ancora qualche residuo addensamento specie sul Triveneto orientale, in Toscana e sul Basso Tirreno, accompagnato da locali piovaschi. Per il resto il tempo sarà in deciso miglioramento ovunque”. Le temperature scenderanno leggermente a causa di venti più freschi dai quadranti settentrionali, specie al meridione ed in Sardegna, ma in complesso il clima sarà mite. Nel weekend sono previste giornate soleggiate eccetto sul nordovest, dove permangono correnti più umide, e in montagna, con addensamenti che comunque non causeranno precipitazioni. Lungo le coste le massime toccheranno 28°C in Sardegna e Sicilia, fino a 27°C in Puglia e Calabria, 25-26°C in Basilicata con Napoli e Roma a 24°C, Firenze a 22°C e Milano sui 20. Nel dettaglio: – Venerdì 11. Al nord: piovaschi sui monti emiliani, sole altrove. Al centro: piovaschi sulla Toscana interna. Al sud: nubi residue con locali piovaschi sulle tirreniche. – Sabato 12. Al nord: nuvoloso. Al centro: soleggiato. Al sud: soleggiato. – Domenica 13. Al nord: sole prevalente. Al centro: soleggiato. Al sud: bel tempo. – Tendenza: rinforzo dell’anticiclone, un pò penalizzato il nord",

    "title": "Massive California waves injure some onlookers and bring flooding, treacherous beach conditions up the West coast",
    "text": "(CNN) — A powerful offshore storm is driving towering waves into the California coastline, triggering flooding and warnings of dangerous and damaging swells after several people were injured by a wave along Ventura beach on Thursday.\nThe wave crashed over a barrier along the southern California beach, tossing a wall of fast-moving water at a group of onlookers who rushed to escape the deluge, witness video shows. Seawater quickly knocked some people off their feet and pummeled cars as drivers tried to speed away.\nNearly 20 people were briefly swept away in the incident and eight people were taken to the hospital, Ventura officials said.\nHigh water and dangerous rip currents will churn along some of California’s beaches through the weekend as much of the West coast – spanning from the US-Mexico border to southern Oregon – is under coastal flood and high-surf alerts, the National Weather Service said.\nWaves as high as telephone poles – about 40 feet – could slam into San Francisco through Friday morning. Fifteen to 20-foot waves are expected along the central coast.\nThe dangerous conditions pose an “exceptional risk” of ocean drowning and damage to structures like piers and jetties, the National Weather Service said.\nThe spectacular waters have enthralled some surfers and onlookers, but weather officials are cautioning that the waves and strong rip tides can be perilous for those nearby.\n“Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore,” the National Weather Service warned.\nAt least one fisherman fell overboard in a harbor off Oxnard and later came ashore uninjured, the Ventura County Fire Department said.\nThe conditions have already caused some road closures and evacuations in coastal California communities and prompted the rescue of five campers along the San Luis Obispo coast.\nCrews in Ventura worked through the night to reinforce a mile-long sand barrier that was damaged by powerful waters on Thursday, the local fire department said. Standing about seven feet tall, the raised wall helps protect beachside communities.\nHoping to discourage spectators, local officials closed a main access point to Ventura Pier, which saw a swell of about 20 feet on Thursday. Some coastal streets in the area have also been closed as a precaution.\nIn central California’s Santa Cruz, the sheriff’s office issued an evacuation warning for some areas on Thursday, which included areas of Rio Del Mar, where seawater filled beachside roadways and pushed against some homes, CNN affiliate KION reported. The warnings were lifted later in the day.\nThe most extreme impacts were expected along the central and Ventura County coasts, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches, the weather service in Los Angeles said Thursday.\nTempestuous waters are also battering Northern California, where the Bay Area could see waves of 28 to 33 feet, the weather service advised.\nA high wind alert is also in effect for the Bay Area on Friday as wind gusts of up to 50 mph are expected.\nRainfall is likely to stretch northward from the Bay Area throughout the day Friday before shifting south into the weekend.\nMassive waves attract surfers to Mavericks Despite safety warnings, the massive waves are a welcome sight to surfers hungry to tackle the legendary swells at Mavericks Beach, about 25 miles south of San Francisco.\nPro surfers and spectators flocked to the beach on Thursday for a competition at the site known for having some of the biggest waves in the world, CNN affiliate KGO reported.\nLocal resident Ion Banner told the affiliate that surfers from Brazil, Tahiti and Hawaii were out in the water. “It’s pretty gnarly, it’s super big,” he said.\n“The waves looked absolutely massive and it was everything that we expected,” said Miguel Blanco, who told KGO he flew in from Portugal to surf the waves. “It was really big, I’d say 40-60 foot waves.”\nMavericks’ jaw-dropping waves – caused by unique underwater rock formations – reach their biggest heights in the winter, when big wave surfers from all over the world make pilgrimages to face the swells.\nThe legendary waves and the surfers who brave them have been the subject of several films and documentaries, including the 2012 biopic “Chasing Mavericks” about American surfer Jay Moriarity’s journey to surf Mavericks as a teen.\nOn Thursday, the conditions were prime for surfers like Blanco.\n“If it’s your turn, you just gotta go,” Blanco said. “When you see a big wave, you’re kinda scared but at the same time you’re feeling like you should go and you just go and enjoy the ride.”\n(Copyright (c) 2023 CNN.

    "text": "Letters submitted by BDN readers are verified by BDN Opinion Page staff. Send your letters to letters@bangordailynews.com Let’s say they’re right, that millions of people will be kicked off Medicaid under the Big Beautiful Bill. Nevermind the claims that the bill will result in more than 50,000 people a year dying from preventable causes. The question becomes, who will absorb the financial impact of this bill? Let’s do the math. Most of Maine’s rural hospitals — those in Houlton, Millinocket, Calais, Machias, Lincoln, Greenville, Skowhegan, Pittsfield, Blue Hill, Mount Desert, Rumford, Norway, Bridgton, Damariscotta, Dover-Foxcroft and Belfast — are designated Critical Access Hospitals. As such, they are required by law to provide, at a minimum, a medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment to anyone who needs immediate medical care, regardless of ability to pay. The Big Beautiful Bill will result in more people without health insurance, not able to afford preventative care and depending on emergency rooms. Emergency room bills are more costly than preventable care and leave hospitals in the position of eating the bills. If you think our hospitals are struggling now, just wait until the Big Beautiful Bill comes into law. Thank you to Sen. Susan Collins for her thoughtful “no” vote on the bill.

    "text": "Infosys lays off trainees at Mysuru campus again, offers alternative roles in BPM\nThe IT giant has terminated 30-45 trainees after they failed internal assessments but is offering alternative roles in its Business Process Management (BPM) unit.\nInfosys has once again laid off trainees from its Mysuru training campus, this time terminating around 30 to 45 individuals after they failed to clear internal assessments. The company, however, has provided them with alternative career options, including training in its Business Process Management (BPM) unit.\nLayoffs follow internal assessment failures\nAccording to sources, the trainees were unable to qualify for the Foundation Skills Training Programme, an internal assessment required for them to continue their apprenticeship at Infosys. Despite being given additional preparation time, mock assessments, and doubt-clearing sessions, the affected trainees could not meet the company’s passing criteria.\nAs a result, Infosys informed them via email that they would no longer be able to continue their training, marking the second round of terminations at the Mysuru campus in just a few months. In January, Infosys had similarly let go of hundreds of trainees for failing assessments, a move that drew widespread criticism.\nCompany offers alternative career paths\nUnlike the previous terminations, this time Infosys has offered a second chance to affected trainees. The company has introduced a 12-week training programme in BPM to help them secure alternative roles.\nTrainees who choose this route will have an opportunity to work in the BPM unit after successfully completing their training. For those unwilling to take up BPM roles, Infosys has also promised to sponsor external training programs to help them secure jobs elsewhere.\nRelief measures for laid-off trainees\nTo ease the transition, Infosys has provided affected trainees with:\n- One-month ex-gratia salary\n- Relieving letters for future job applications\n- Transport assistance from Mysuru to Bengaluru for those who opt out of BPM\n- Accommodation at the Employee Care Centre in Mysuru until their departure\nThe company has set a deadline of March 27 for trainees to submit their travel and accommodation preferences.\nLabour Department clears Infosys of wrongdoing\nAfter backlash over the earlier layoffs, the Karnataka Labour Department investigated the matter and found that Infosys had not violated any labour laws. The Union Labour Ministry had also sought a report, following allegations that Infosys was terminating trainees unfairly.\nInfosys has maintained that its internal assessment policies have been in place for years and are necessary to ensure the quality of its workforce.\nFreshers hiring policies under scrutiny\nInfosys’ repeated layoffs of trainees have sparked concerns over its hiring and training policies. Critics argue that the company should reconsider how it evaluates freshers, especially given the uncertain job market in the IT sector.\nWhile Infosys has taken steps to mitigate the impact of these terminations, the IT giant may still face questions about whether its assessment system is too rigid and whether it should adopt a more supportive approach for struggling trainees.\nGet Latest Business News, Stock Market Updates and Videos; Check your tax outgo through Income Tax Calculator and save money through our Personal Finance coverage.
