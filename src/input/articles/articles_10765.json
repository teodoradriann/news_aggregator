    "text": "拜登罹癌後罕見公開發聲 警告其任內成果正被瓦解\n鉅亨網新聞中心\n美國前總統拜登（Joe Biden）自 5 月公開罹患癌症以來，周三 (2 日) 在聖地亞哥發表了其離任後最長一次公開演講。他表示，在川普政府執政下，他擔任總統期間的一些重大成果「正在迅速改變」，而多位歐洲領導人自他卸任以來已主動尋求他的建議。「有些我曾拚盡全力改變的事情，正迅速被逆轉。」\n這位前總統在美國人力資源管理協會（SHRM）主辦的大會上，面對數千名人力資源專業人士演講逾一小時。在整場講話中，拜登沒有直接提及川普的名字，但他警告稱，美國若選擇從國際舞台撤退，將帶來嚴重風險，並重申其在任期間大力強化北約（NATO）的外交成果。\n「我們在我任內實質性地強化了北約。」拜登談到，「現在，我——我不會具體說是誰，也不能說——正不斷接到一些歐洲領導人的電話，請我參與協調。」「我沒有介入，但我會給他們建議。」\n芬蘭與瑞典在拜登總統任內加入北約，此重大轉變主要受 2022 年俄羅斯入侵烏克蘭事件推動。自那以來，美國與北約盟國已向烏克蘭提供了數百億美元的軍事援助。\n而川普則多次對美國是否會兌現北約防務承諾表示懷疑，並持續批評歐洲盟國軍費開支不足。儘管他上月在北約峰會結束時宣稱該聯盟「並非騙局」，但外界質疑並未完全打消。\n針對拜登發言，白宮發言人 Anna Kelly 代表川普政府回應稱，拜登執政時期的外交政策「令美國前所未有地軟弱」。\n「多虧了川普總統，北約盟國已作出史無前例的 5% 軍費承諾，伊朗核能力被摧毀，美國在世界舞台上的地位也得以恢復。」\n現年 82 歲的拜登表示，他仍持續參與政治討論，是因為「我真的在乎自己當初在做的事情」。他還透露，來自民主黨和共和黨的議員都有人主動聯絡他，分享想法。\n他表示，「那些我曾拚盡全力爭取、我以為已經實現的國家變革，眼下正以驚人的速度被逆轉。」\n儘管在參議院剛剛以些微優勢通過川普「大而美」法案後不久發表演講，拜登並未直接點名批評該法案。\n這項立法將為減稅和川普推動的移民與邊境政策提供資金；但參議院版本卻將更多食品援助成本轉嫁給各州，且預計到 2034 年將有約 1,200 萬人失去聯邦醫療補助（Medicaid）資格。\n此次 SHRM 年會，是拜登自 1 月卸任以來少數幾次公開露面之一。他在發言中特別強調，在高壓職場中也應給予家庭、健康與失去親人的經歷應有的優先地位，並表示自己曾鼓勵同事也這麼做。\n拜登於 5 月公開自己被診斷為晚期、侵襲性前列腺癌。據美國癌症協會數據，患有轉移性前列腺癌的患者五年生存率不足 40%。\n人力資源協會主席 Johnny C. Taylor Jr. 在演講結束後登台與拜登對談時，問拜登最希望被人記住什麼。拜登答道：「做一個好父親。」\n以伊衝突看懂局勢，掌握搶進關鍵>- 掌握全球財經資訊\n點我下載APP\n下一篇",

    "text": "Cake in the time of war, in Gaza RAFAH, Gaza Strip — There is war in Gaza, and now, for some, there is also cake — with peanut butter cream, coconut flakes and sprinkles. Batool Cakes, [a professional bakery](https://www.facebook.com/batoolcake2) with three branches throughout Gaza, started baking cakes at its Rafah branch a month ago, for the first time since the Israel-Hamas war began. It's surprisingly busy with orders in a city of tent camps, shelters and bread lines. \"We were shocked by the huge demand,\" says Ibrahim Abu Hani, head baker and co-owner of the family business. It might sound jarring: a cake shop in Rafah, the southernmost city that has become swollen with the majority of Gaza's population, many of whom eat only one meal a day, and facing an Israeli threat to send in troops for a final battle against Hamas. Selling cake — while, at the opposite end of Gaza, in the battered north, Palestinians suffer extreme hunger. But children need cheering up. Birthdays come only once a year. And couples won't let a war delay their weddings. \"We Gazans love life. People are pushing themselves to hope,\" Abu Hani says. \"Because there are no other options.\" The first cake orders Abu Hani had not planned on making cakes during this war. He had to flee his home, like most people in Gaza. As Rafah took in more than 1.5 million Palestinians fleeing the fighting, he kept the cake shop open, without cake, just to let people charge their phones for free. There's no electricity now in Gaza, and the bakery runs on solar power. A month ago, a man walked into the bakery. He told Abu Hani his son had been injured in the war, gone to the hospital, woken up from the anesthesia and said: \"My birthday has arrived. Where is the cake you promised?\" \"Should we work on the cake?\" Abu Hani wondered. He didn't have to think twice. He got started, using leftover ingredients in the bakery from before the war began. As he was baking that first cake, another man walked into the shop. His little daughter was scared by the war and he wanted to throw her a party. He became Abu Hani's second customer. Little by little, the baker was baking again. Every cake comes with a story \"Each person who came in had his own story,\" he says. One evening, as Abu Hani was closing up for the day, a man begged for a cake for his wedding that very night. \"It's the night of my life, and I'm living in a tent,\" Abu Hani recalls the groom said. The baker couldn't resist. Some customers ask for a take-home bag that's not see-through, so other people in their tent camp won't get jealous of their cake. \"Two hours ago,\" the baker says, \"someone called me and said, 'I'm embarrassed to come to the shop. I'm in a shelter. Ever since we passed by your shop, my child has been asking for a cake.'\" The caller couldn't afford a whole cake, and asked if he could buy a smaller one. The baker told him to pay whatever he could. Abu Hani handles each cake, and customer, with care. Flour from the black market During the war, supplies in Gaza are low and prices are high. Sugar and eggs cost a fortune — a kilo of sugar has jumped from $1 to $20 in Rafah, and a large crate of eggs that normally sells for $10 can now cost more than $50, he says. Batool Cakes now sells its standard \"mini-medium\" cakes for 70 shekels, or nearly $17 — up from its pre-war price of 35 shekels, nearly $10, due to the rising cost of ingredients during the war. Abu Hani is not making a profit on his bakery. He buys black-market flour that belongs to the United Nations, that is meant to be given away as aid. He says he feels bad, but that it's worth it to see the joy in his customers' eyes. Abu Hani struggles to find other ingredients. He can't find the cream he used to buy. He has butter cream, but he says people in Gaza don't like it. They prefer lighter cream, so he's trying to recreate it from scratch. He closes the bakery whenever he needs to test a new recipe. He doesn't want to sell something that's not first rate. He says the people of Gaza deserve it. Even in their worst desperation, he says, they have standards, and he has standards, too. The war hasn't changed that. \"We are not a garbage dump. We are not a place where people will eat just anything,\" Abu Hani says. \"People in Gaza have very refined taste.\" Copyright 2024 NPR.

    "text": "Sir David Attenborough’s AI voice clone – level 2\n22-11-2024 15:00\nSir David Attenborough is upset about AI copying his voice. The BBC showed him clips where AI imitated his voice, and he strongly disliked it.\nDr. Jennifer Williams, an AI expert, explained how AI technologies clone voices. They often gather audio from the internet and create a model. Some people use it for fun, but others use it to spread fake news, which is harmful.\nSir David’s voice is trusted worldwide, so misusing it can confuse people. Dr. Williams said that we need strict rules to stop this kind of misuse. She also advised people to check if a voice is real by investigating its source and context. AI is growing quickly, and protecting voices like Sir David’s is becoming more important.\nDifficult words: [imitate](https://www.newsinlevels.com/?s=imitate) (to copy), [misuse](https://www.newsinlevels.com/?s=misuse) (to use something in the wrong way), [confuse](https://www.newsinlevels.com/?s=confuse) (to make someone feel unclear or uncertain).\nYou can watch the original video in the Level 3 section.\nWhat advice did Dr. Jennifer Williams give to people in order to determine if a voice is real or not, and why is it important to protect voices like Sir David Attenborough's according to her?\nLEARN 3000 WORDS with NEWS IN LEVELS\nNews in Levels is designed to teach you 3000 words in English.

    "text": "US intelligence officials determined the Chinese spy balloon used a US internet provider to communicate\nU.S. intelligence officials have determined that the Chinese spy balloon that flew across the U.S. earlier this year used an American internet service provider to communicate, according to two current and one former U.S. official familiar with the assessment.\nThe balloon connected to a U.S.-based company, according to the assessment, to send and receive communications from China, primarily related to navigation of the balloon. Officials familiar with assessment said it found that the connection allowed the balloon to send burst transmissions, or high-bandwidth collections of data over short periods of time.\nThe Biden administration sought a highly secretive court order from the federal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to collect intelligence on it while it was over the U.S., according to multiple current and former U.S. officials. How the court ruled has not been disclosed.\nSuch a court order would have allowed U.S. intelligence agencies to conduct electronic surveillance on the balloon as it flew over the U.S and as it sent and received messages to and from China, the officials said, including communication sent via the American internet service provider.\nThe company denied that the Chinese balloon had used its network, a determination it said was based on its own investigation and discussions it had with U.S. officials. NBC News is not naming the provider at this time to protect the identity of its sources.\nhttps://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/national-international/us-intelligence-officials-determined-the-chinese-spy-balloon-used-a-us-internet-provider-to-communicate/4988496/",
