[Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Updated: 16-02-2024 16:30 IST | Created: 16-02-2024 16:30 IST University of Havana professor Daniela Ventura has intercepted a migrant. Her net, stretched taut on a forest trail in Havana's Botanical Garden, trembles. A catbird - a discretely clad gray bird with a black cap - thrashes then succumbs as she plucks it from the net's near invisible webbing. Ventura calls out observations to her students who take notes nearby - species, weight, an estimate of the bird's body fat. They are fresh data points in a project that aims to unravel mysteries into how and where migratory birds from the United States and Canada spend their winters in Cuba. \"We know a lot about their ecology in the breeding zone (in North America) but very little about what happens in their wintering zone,\" Ventura said in an interview. Part of the problem is politics, said Lourdes Mugica, an ornithologist who helped to organize the research. A U.S. Cold War-era embargo, which restricts trade and financial transactions on the Caribbean island, has long complicated cooperation - even in science - between the U.S. and Cuba. The birds, though, are indifferent, Mugica said. \"Birds don't understand embargoes or geographic borders, they don't need a visa to enter our country,\" she said. \"I hope there comes a time when relations are normal and that we can have joint projects between (the U.S. and Cuba).\" Mugica and Martin Acosta, pioneering ornithologists in Cuba, say this project - with partnership from Environment and Climate Change Canada - hints at what is possible. Together, the Canadian and Cuban partners have installed a radio telemetry antenna - Cuba's first under an international tracking program called MOTUS - which follows birds radio-tagged in other parts of North America. The antenna recently detected in Cuba a tiny Swainson's thrush, first tagged in British Columbia, Canada, a voyage of 5,000 km (3,100 mi). \"We never though we'd reach the level of sophistication we now enjoy,\" said Acosta. Mugica and Acosta recall hard days during their careers - Mugica said she lost 70 pounds (32 kg) doing research decades ago, at a time when food in Cuba was scarce. Logistics remain an issue even today. The scientists' 20-year-old pick-up truck needed a push start on a recent morning. But the team celebrates small victories. The catbird ensnared in the mist net had been captured and affixed with an identifying leg band back in November at the same site, Ventura's data showed. It had gained body fat in the three months since, she said, ahead of its coming migration north across the Gulf of Mexico. \"To think these little birds, which weigh less than 10 grams (0.35 oz), cross the sea and come back and survive is spectacular,\" she said. \"It's humbling ...to think that other living beings can perform these feats.\" (This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

    "text": "HEFEI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Alstom, a French multinational rolling stock manufacturer, inaugurated its new joint venture in Hefei, east China's Anhui Province, on Wednesday. The new company, Hefei Alstom Rail Transport Equipment Co., Ltd. (HATEE), is funded by Shanghai Alstom Transport Electrical Equipment Co., Ltd. (SATEE) and is expected to start trial production of its products in October. HATEE will establish a base for the design and manufacturing of traction systems and their components, project management, and lifecycle maintenance services. The traction systems will include the newly developed metro traction systems specifically designed for the standardized metro vehicles in the Chinese market. HATEE is the second joint venture company established by Alstom in Anhui, following CRRC Puzhen Alstom Transportation Systems Co., Ltd. (PATS) located in the city of Wuhu. Geng Ming, managing director of Alstom China, said that the establishment of the new company is a powerful testimony for the strengthening of the China-France economic and trade cooperation, and also an important strategic initiative for Alstom to deepen its industrial footprint in the country. HATEE will play an important role in Hefei's rail transit industry chain and support the city's rail transit industry to expand in the domestic market and enter the overseas markets, according to Geng. The traction equipment designed and manufactured by HATEE will not only serve metro and commuter train projects in China but also power Alstom metro vehicles globally. During the opening ceremony, which was attended by Bertrand Lortholary, French ambassador to China, the company unveiled the traction systems that will be delivered for Hefei's new metro line, Metro Line 8. It will be the first fully automated metro line in Hefei, with a total length of 22.5 km. Up to now, Alstom has 11 joint ventures and almost 10,000 employees in China. The joint ventures have delivered more than 6,000 railway passenger cars, 1,530 electric locomotives and more than 7,200 metro cars to China's growing rail transit market as well as to overseas markets.",

    "text": "Recent reports have revealed that all employees working at Annapurna Interactive have resigned. This information was published by Bloomberg and supported by IGN. If you are interested in the state of the video game industry, you can check out our other articles here. All Annapurna Interactive Employees Resign, Why? SCOOP: The entire staff of Annapurna Interactive has resigned, leaving dev partners scrambling to figure out what’s next. The video game publisher had been negotiating with Annapurna owner Megan Ellison (Larry’s daughter) to spin out. Deal fell through. https://t.co/aDUxW2oK8g— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) [September 12, 2024](https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1834347547952890144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Bloomberg reported that Annapurna Interactive founder Nathan Gary and his team have been in talks with Annapurna Pictures founder Meghan Ellison to spin off the games division as an independent company. IGN later corroborated the report. When Ellison withdrew from negotiations, Gary and other executives resigned, followed by about two dozen other employees. “All 25 members of the Annapurna Interactive team have collectively resigned,” Gary said in a statement to Bloomberg. “This is one of the most difficult decisions we have ever had to make and we do not take this action lightly.” An Annapurna Pictures spokesperson also confirmed to Bloomberg that they had explored the separation and the two parties failed to reach an agreement, leading to the resignation. Here is Meghan Ellison’s official statement to Bloomberg: Our top priority is to continue supporting our developer and publisher partners during this transition. We are committed to not only developing our existing games, but also expanding our presence in the interactive world as we continue to look for opportunities to take a more integrated approach to linear and interactive storytelling across film and TV, games, and theater. Meghan Ellison, Founder of Annapurna Pictures Annapurna Interactive’s new president, Hector Sanchez, who just rejoined in August 2024, has told developers that they will honor existing contracts and replace employees who have left. In early September 2024, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Annapurna Interactive was looking to expand into AAA games. The Fate of All Games to be Published by Annapurna Interactive? On the other hand, Bloomberg reports that this resignation has caused chaos among the developers who partnered with Annapurna Interactive. Remedy Entertainment’s communications director, Thomas Puha, clarified that the deal for the self-publishing of Control 2 as well as the film and TV adaptations for Control and Alan Wake is with Annapurna Pictures, not Annapurna Interactive. The Stanley Parable developer Davey Wreden confirmed that his next Ivy Road game, Wanderstop, will not be affected. The studio behind the Mixtape, Beethoven & Dinosaur, simply said: “Appreciate everyone who has reached out. The Mixtape continues.” Matt Newell, the developer behind Lushfoil Photography Sim, also posted his own statement regarding the Annapurna Interactive situation: It’s safe to assume at this point that Lushfoil Photography Sim won’t be affected, considering the game itself is mostly finished. I’ll keep you all posted. But this news is definitely a loss, the Annapurna Interactive team was a joy to work with and put a lot of love into the project. Matt Newell An Annapurna Pictures spokesperson has told Bloomberg that all existing games and projects will remain under the Annapurna Interactive umbrella. It’s still unclear what will happen to Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, the first game being developed internally by Annapurna Interactive. There are 8 other games that will be published by Annapurna Interactive: Bounty Star (DINOGOD) Ghost Bike (Messhof) Skin Deep (Blendo Games) We Kill Monsters (Glass Revolver) to a T (uvula) The Lost Wild (Great Ape Games) Forever Ago (Third Shift) Morsels (Furcula)",

    "text": "The story has only come out now, but it has been officially confirmed: a robot 'attacked' a Tesla engineer in 2021, injuring his left hand in the Giga Texas factory of the company owned by Elon Musk. The accident was revealed by several US media in recent weeks and today sparked a piqued reaction from Musk who, replying to a user on 'X', explained that the accident was not due to Optimus, Tesla's humanoid robot, but to a simple Kuka industrial robotic arm. “It is truly shameful that the media brings up an accident from two years ago due to a simple Kuka industrial robotic arm (which is present in all factories) and insinuates that it is now due to Optimus,” Musk writes. The engineer was programming the software that controls manufacturing robots at Tesla's factory in Austin, Texas, when something went wrong. Two of the robots, which cut car parts from freshly melted pieces of aluminium, 'The Information' notes, were deactivated so that the engineer and members of his team could work safely on the machines. A third robot, which grabs and moves car parts, was inadvertently left operational, according to two people who witnessed the accident. As the robot performed its normal movements, it pinned the engineer against a surface, pushing its claws into his body and wounding him on his back and arm. A worker hit the emergency stop button, subsequently allowing the engineer to escape the robot's grasp, falling a couple of meters down a chute designed to collect aluminum scrap and leaving a trail of blood in his wake, one said of witnesses. #Tesla #robot #attacks #injures #engineer #FormulaPassion.it",

    "text": "After a disappointing 2023-24 season, the Los Angeles Lakers haven’t exactly gotten better this offseason. In fact, one could argue they have actually gotten a little bit worse.\nTheir only additions, at least so far, have been draft picks Dalton Knecht and Bronny James. While Knecht could be the most NBA-ready player in this year’s draft class, one cannot necessarily expect him to make a major impact right away.\nESPN BET has come out with its over/unders for this coming NBA season, and the Lakers came in at a meager 44.5.\nIf a reasonable number of things go right for the Lakers, 44.5 seems a bit too low.\nThey won 47 regular season games this past season, and that was despite the fact that then-head coach Darvin Ham fiddled foolishly with the starting lineup during the first half of the schedule. In addition, the team didn’t bother to play hard on a consistent basis, leading to several losses to inferior opponents.\nStarting at midseason, Los Angeles began to figure things out, allowing it to finish the season with 23 wins in its final 33 games. During that stretch, it put up some gaudy offensive numbers, as it ranked fourth in offensive rating, third in scoring average and 3-point accuracy and second in field-goal percentage after the All-Star break.\nIt looks like the oddsmakers are counting on LeBron James and Anthony Davis to miss a lot of games after they appeared in 71 and 76 contests, respectively, this past season. That’s certainly possible, but it’s also possible both remain healthy once again while also turning in excellent seasons.\nGannett may earn revenue from sports betting operators for audience referrals to betting services.
