Headlines January 10, 2025 Delay in CCP decision on Telenor-PTCL merger risks Pakistan’s 5G launch timeline: report Litigation over 140 MHz spectrum and merger uncertainty may derail April 2025 target for 5G rollout\nBy Monitoring Desk The Competition Commission of Pakistan’s (CCP) delay in deciding the acquisition of Telenor Pakistan by Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) has raised concerns over meeting the government’s timeline for launching 5G services by April 2025.\nAccording to a report by Business Recorder , officials and industry insiders are concerned regarding the unresolved status of Telenor and the ongoing litigation over 140 MHz of spectrum in the 2.6 GHz band, a prime frequency for both LTE/4G and 5G, posing significant hurdles to the planned rollout.\nThe National Economic Research Associates Inc (NERA), a US-based consultancy firm hired by the government to oversee the spectrum auction, flagged these issues in its assessment. NERA emphasized the need for clarity on the number of Cellular Mobile Operators (CMOs) in light of the proposed Telenor-PTCL merger and recommended an expedited decision.\nCurrently, only 54 MHz in the 2.6 GHz band is available, while the remaining 140 MHz is tied up in legal disputes. Experts warn that this limited availability may not meet the requirements of a single operator, undermining the potential to enhance broadband services nationwide.\nThe Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) engaged NERA on November 5, 2024, to provide recommendations for releasing spectrum to improve next-generation mobile broadband services.\nNERA is expected to complete its report within 60 working days. However, delays in resolving the merger and spectrum litigation could hinder its ability to deliver actionable recommendations.\nOnce the CCP reaches a decision on the merger, the matter must pass through regulatory approvals, including the PTA, Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), and State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). This process could take one to two months, further compressing the timeline for the 5G auction.\nThe government had initially planned to auction the 5G spectrum by March 2023, but unresolved issues have continued to push back the timeline. Without swift resolutions, experts caution that the April 2025 launch target may become unfeasible.\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin WhatsApp Email Previous article IMF agrees to clear PIA’s Rs45bn negative equity, remove 18% GST on aircraft, NA body informed Next article SECP flags illegal deposit scheme under Summit 4X Trade, warns public against investing Monitoring Desk Our monitoring team diligently searches the vast expanse of the web to carefully handpick and distill top-tier business and economic news stories and articles, presenting them to you in a concise and informative manner.

In Pakistan’s context, particularly in the wake of the groundbreaking Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 2010 [“18th Amendment”], there is an amplified need for both provincial and federal governments to collaborate proactively and seamlessly. A harmonized and synchronized approach is essential to lay the foundation for a resilient economy. This approach allows merchants the freedom to leverage business-friendly policies and capitalize on the distinctive geographic and natural advantages that each province may offer. By fostering such collaboration, Pakistan can unlock the full potential of its economic landscape, promoting growth, innovation, and prosperity. A persistent challenge in this context lies in the erratic and unpredictable enforcement of laws, rules and regulations, notably following changes in government. The prevalent ad-hoc approach has left various industries and businesses vulnerable to heightened risks, precariously placing their investments. The absence of a robust regulatory control and its continuity has contributed to an atmosphere of uncertainty, making imperative the demand for a more stable and consistent framework to safeguard the interests of industries and businesses amid transitions in governmental leadership. Similarly, the synergy among diverse government entities and within individual jurisdictions remains conspicuously missing. Businesses find themselves navigating through various departments at both provincial and federal levels for any transaction, be it financial or non-financial. Addressing this inefficiency necessitates a significant reform in coordinating bodies across different jurisdictional levels. It thus becomes essential for these bodies to be proactive and arrange joint meetings involving all stakeholders within each business domain. Such a collaborative approach, aims at systematically ironing out anomalies, streamlining processes that can foster a more conducive environment for businesses. By achieving better interdepartmental communication and coordination, a more efficient and business-friendly, landscape can be cultivated, improving overall ease of doing business. Unfortunately, our government departments have not kept pace with the rapidly evolving needs of the modern world. It is evident that they are hugely lagging behind in aligning themselves with the dynamic growth of local businesses in Pakistan. The existing policy gaps and practical ineffectiveness pose substantial obstacles to providing an environment for prosperity. In the global landscape where technology spearheads transformative reforms, Pakistan must proactively embrace this change. Technological integration is indispensable in eliminating inefficiencies and redundancies within governmental processes, leading to operational efficiency. Embracing technology-driven reforms is not just a necessity, but also a strategic imperative to propel Pakistan’s bureaucratic machinery into a more responsive and adaptable entity, better aligned with the contemporary worldwide demands of businesses. In today’s interconnected realm, where countries are more intertwined than ever, optimizing international trade processes across borders is essential. Inefficiencies at domestic level can ominously affect investment decisions and hinder export potential. Streamlining cross-border operations is paramount in ensuring a seamless and efficient global trade. Hesitation in resorting to technological solutions often translates into reliance on paper documentation and cumbersome customs and border management protocols causing suboptimal port operations and jeopardizing a nation’s competitiveness. According to the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Report published in 2020, Pakistan ranked 108 out of 190 countries. While discussing Pakistan’s position on the ‘Trading Across Borders’ factor, the report highlights that it takes 55 hours for documentary compliance and 58 hours for border compliance for export related matters, whereas for imports, it takes 96 hours for documentary compliance and 120 hours for border compliance formalities. These statistics that have not changed much till the end of 2023, underscore the urgent need for technological advancements to streamline trade processes, reduce bureaucratic hurdles, giving Pakistan better opportunities to engage in international trade. For addressing the above challenges, the government in 2017 introduced Pakistan Single Window (PSW) initiative. This Integrated Digital Platform serves as an innovative solution allowing all parties engaged in trade to submit standardized information and documents through a single-entry point. Pakistan Customs, at the forefront of innovation, is leading the charge with the PSW initiative to revolutionize the cross-border trade landscape in Pakistan. This ambitious project is focused on digitalizing operations and removing outdated manual paper-based processes. The core objective is to significantly reduce the time and cost associated with conducting business. The PSW operates as a comprehensive framework, harmonizing Customs and regulatory processes pertaining to the clearance of import, export, and transit goods. Serving as a unified “one-window” solution, it adds value and efficiency for various stakeholders, including government bodies, traders, port operators, ground handling agents, freight forwarders, transporters, and shipping agents, ushering in a new era of streamlined and efficient trade practices. Singapore stands as a notable example and a frontrunner in the successful execution of a single window solution in resolving issues related to import and export operations. The TradeNet system, a flagship initiative, has been instrumental, processing over 24,000 trade declarations daily. This efficient system accomplishes a remarkable feat by handling 99% of permits within a mere 10-minute timeframe, exemplifying Singapore’s commitment to expeditious and streamlined trade processes. Furthermore, the system facilitates seamless collections through interbank deductions, accentuating its robust and sophisticated design. Singapore’s exemplary success in implementing a single window solution serves as a benchmark for governments worldwide desirous of achieving similar objectives. Likewise in Europe, the computerization journey of Port of Hamburg in Germany commenced in 1982 with the establishment of its port community system, known as DAKOSY. Considered a landmark accomplishment, it has since evolved into a fully “paperless port.” By 2017, DAKOSY had transformed into the port’s single window platform, boasting a network of over 10,000 stakeholders connected to its Single Submission Point (SSP). This comprehensive framework facilitates seamless exchange of business data for all logistics, companies and authorities engaged in export, import, and transit processes through its centralized data center. DAKOSY serves as an inclusive platform benefiting shipping lines, rail transport companies, trucking companies, feeders, international trade firms, and industrial enterprises. Pakistan must undertake concentered and pragmatic efforts to attract foreign investment. Beyond elevating ease of doing business ranking, we should also address internal challenges, particularly political instability. Internal conflicts are depleting vital resources, forcing us to lag behind in the region. In today’s Fourth Industrial Revolution, where technology eclipses traditional approaches, Pakistan must take proactive steps. Technological advancements will enhance competitiveness, positioning Pakistan among forerunners on the global economic landscape.

    "text": "By HC Green ,\n18 minutes ago Ahead of the final draft weekend, it’s time to look at five players we don’t want on our fantasy rosters for 2024. As ever, all players have value. Those listed here are ones we see falling well short of delivering the production versus where you’d need to draft them in most instances.\nQB Anthony Richardson, Indianapolis Colts\nCredit: Albert Cesare/The Enquirer / USA TODAY NETWORK\nA year ago, Richardson was something of a curiosity. His measurables and athleticism were off the charts, but there were concerns about his accuracy and decision making. That put him around QB15 in fantasy rankings. Now, heading into Year 2, he's QB6 in ADP. So, what exactly changed? As a rookie, Richardson started four games and was injured in three of them, ultimately missing most of his debut campaign after needing shoulder surgery. He didn't bank a lot of reps, and he hasn't looked particularly sharp in the preseason -- his last outing against a Cincinnati Bengals squad sitting their starters saw him throw a Pick-6 and once again deal with accuracy and decision-making issues. Yes, Richardson is a physical marvel, and his running ability could make him a viable fantasy starter, but again, how is this scenario any different than last year when he was QB16 in ADP? For us, Richardson carries all the same concerns he had in 2023, and now you must add durability issues on top of it. RB Aaron Jones, Minnesota Vikings & Zamir White, Las Vegas Raiders\nCredit: Brad Rempel-USA TODAY Sports\nWe're cheating a bit here and including two names. We'll start with Jones, who signed with Minnesota during the offseason after seven years with the Green Bay Packers . His strong close to 2023 -- he topped 100 yards in five straight games -- helped the Packers almost reach the NFC Championship Game, but they followed an injury-filled, ineffective first 15 weeks. He turns 30 this December, has struggled to stay healthy despite operating in a timeshare backfield, and is departing an ascending offense to one in transition with quarterback Sam Darnold at the helm. A seldom-used reserve for most of his first two seasons, White earned his chance last December when now-Packers RB Josh Jacobs injured his knee. Thrust into the lead role, White ran 84 times for 397 yards and a score over the final four games. His 2024 outlook is based largely on that minute sample size when he was fresh running against tired opponents. That's dangerous. Add to that a shaky offense and a backup in RB Alexander Mattison , who's familiar with the new blocking scheme, and it's not hard to envision White underperforming expectations. Both backs carry significant risk for modest upside. WR Keenan Allen, Chicago Bears\nCredit: Gregory Fisher-USA TODAY Sports\nAfter spending his first 11 seasons with the Los Angeles Chargers , Allen was traded to the Bears during the offseason to help shepherd another young quarterback. In four years with QB Justin Herbert , Allen averaged 95 receptions, 1,031 yards, and 6.3 TDs -- despite missing 14 games during that stretch. Initially, this seemed like reachable production for the veteran, but things changed when Chicago used the ninth overall pick to select WR Rome Odunze . Pair that with the massive contract extension they handed to WR DJ Moore , and it'd be shocking if Allen wasn't one-and-done in the Windy City. Contract uncertainty alone is no reason to kill Allen's fantasy value, but with Moore, Odunze, TE Cole Kmet and rookie QB Caleb Williams all huge parts of Chicago's future it makes sense those would be the relationships they'd prioritize developing. Beyond that, Allen is entering his age-32 season and will be playing his home games outside of California for the first time (he went to college at Cal). Allen's physique and lack of quickness have also been pointed out during training camp, though it's hard to judge a 12-year pro by how he looks in August. Still, add it all up and you wonder how high his ceiling really is. WR DeVonta Smith, Philadelphia Eagles\nCredit: Nathan Ray Seebeck-USA TODAY Sports\nIn 2022, it looked like Smith and fellow wideout A.J. Brown were set to form a 1a/1b tandem for the Eagles. Instead, Brown as emerged as the clear WR1 while Smith has settled into the No. 2 role. That's not an inherently bad spot, but Philly is built around their running game and QB Jalen Hurts ’ dual-threat ability more than their passing attack -- to that end, Hurts ranked 20th in passing attempts per game among the 31 QBs to throw at least 250 times last year. With fewer opportunities, target share becomes more important. Last year, Brown was targeted 9.3 times per game compared to 7.0 for Smith. TE Dallas Goedert was next at 5.9. Additional moves could mean an even smaller role for Smith in 2024, most notably the signing of RB Saquon Barkley , who is an excellent pass catcher out of the backfield, and WR Jahan Dotson , a former first-round pick acquired to shore up the No. 3 receiver spot. Smith is currently being selected as WR23. That feels too high. TE David Njoku, Cleveland Browns\nCredit: Nate Ulrich / USA TODAY NETWORK\nFantasy owners waited years for Njoku to have a breakout season. It finally came last year when he set career highs in targets (123), receptions (81), yards (882), and touchdowns (6). Unfortunately, he wasn't all that effective when QB Deshaun Watson was under center. In fact, in the five games Watson played significant snaps, Njoku posted 20 catches for 176 yards and one score -- projected over a full season, that's a 68-599-3 line. It's certainly possible that with more reps together, the chemistry between Watson and Njoku will grow, but don't forget that Cleveland swung a deal for WR Jerry Jeudy this offseason, giving them a top-three receiver corps of Jeudy, Amari Cooper , and Elijah Moore . Plus, while it isn't exactly apples to apples, in his three years as the Houston Texans full-time quarterback, Watson never had a tight end log more than 418 yards. Given all of that, statistical regression seems like a real possibility for Njoku. 1\n1\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

Estas han sido las tajantes palabras del cardenal secretario de Estado, Pietro Parolin, frente a las últimas noticias que han salido a la luz acerca de una posible renuncia del Papa Francisco que, en la última semana, en la que ha sido ingresado en el Policlínico Agostino Gemelli de Roma a causa de una neumonía, han acaparado los medios de comunicación.\nCuestionado en principio por Il Corriere della Sera, Parolin ha animado a centrarse “en la salud del Santo Padre, en su recuperación y en su regreso al Vaticano: son las únicas cosas que importan”. De hecho, la Sala de Prensa de la Santa Sede informaba esta mañana que el Papa había pasado \"buena noche\", del mismo modo que han especificado que no rezará mañana el ángelus de forma pública, al igual que ocurrió el pasado domingo.\nLas palabras de Parolin han llegado un día después de que saltara en RaiNews 24 la noticia de que el Papa había recibido la visita en el hospital de los cardenales Parolin y Gianfranco Ghirlanda, jesuita y conocido canonista. Decía que esto solo podía significar que Francisco estaba pensando en renunciar. Una clara noticia falsa ante la que el Vaticano, que no tiene costumbre de salir a desmentir informaciones, publicaba un comunicado desmintiendo tal visita.\nEn esta ocasión, ha sido Parolin el que ha asegurado que no ha ido a visitar a Francisco durante su ingreso. “Le he hecho saber que estoy disponible para reunirme con él, si lo considera necesario, pero hasta ahora no ha habido necesidad”, ha explicado al periódico italiano. “En este sentido, lo mejor es que permanezca protegido y tenga la menor cantidad de visitas posible, para poder descansar y así hacer más efectivas los tratamientos a las que está sometido”, ha explicado.\n\"No vale la pena que algunos grupos presionen para una renuncia\"\nEl cardenal Víctor Manuel ‘Tucho’ Fernández también ha mostrado una postura similar, y ha asegurado en una entrevista a Elisabetta Piqué para La Nación que no ve “clima de pre-cónclave”. “No hay más conversaciones sobre un un posible sucesor que las que había un año atrás, es decir, nada especial. Hasta ahora percibo bastante respeto”, ha asegurado.\n“No vale la pena que algunos grupos presionen para una renuncia”, ha explicado. “Ya lo han hecho varias veces en los últimos años, y esa solo puede ser una decisión ‘completamente libre’ del Santo Padre, aun para que pueda ser valida”, añadía Fernández.",

    "text": "Thousands of homes remain without power as the post-storm cleanup begins in the wake of Storm Gerrit. Around 1,500 homes in Scotland experienced their second night without power in Scotland while a lightning strike hit supplies in Wales on Thursday. Power company Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it had restored supply to more than 46,000 properties that lost power due to the storm, with people in the north east and Shetland worst affected. They said the remaining homes should be reconnected on Friday with welfare vans serving hot food and drink to affected customers from 9am. Operations director Andy Smith said: “This has been a difficult couple of days for the communities affected and I’m grateful to them for their patience and support as our teams work extremely hard to restore power.” National Grid UK said 36,000 properties were without power in Ceredigion on Thursday after lightning struck. Three men died after their 4×4 vehicle was submerged in the River Esk, near Glaisdale, on Thursday, North Yorkshire Police said. A supercell thunderstorm moved across the northwest of England on Thursday after a similar storm is thought to have resulted in a tornado that damaged homes in Greater Manchester on Wednesday. Around 100 properties were damaged by what police called a “localised tornado” in Stalybridge, Tameside and in the badly-hit village of Carrbrook. Hayley McCaffer, 40, who lives in Carrbrook, told the PA news agency that some of her neighbours’ houses “are an absolute disaster” with missing roofs and “squished” cars. Damage will be covered by standard property insurance policies, the Association of British Insurers has said. ScotRail said many lines have been reopened but urged passengers to check for the latest information before travelling, a message echoed by LNER, Avanti West Coast and London Northwestern Railway who suspensed or cancelled services due to damage or system faults. Friday will see significant disruption for travellers wishing to travel on the London Euston and Watford Junction lines with services expected to be up and running by the end of the day. In Wales, the aftermath of the recent severe weather will see rail services hampered until Monday. Ferry services also experienced cancellations and delays due to storm activity with operator DFDS confirming sailings between Dover and France were delayed due to strong winds in the English Channel. Air travel in and out of the UK saw cancellations but most services have returned to normal. The Met Office reported the worst of Storm Gerrit had passed with the last few days of 2023 forecast to be unsettled with strong winds, rain and even snow on higher ground. Met Office chief forecaster Steven Ramsdale said: “Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday, affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”",
