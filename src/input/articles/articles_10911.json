    "text": "Ja’Marr Chase has disrespectful take on Chiefs’ defense\nCincinnati Bengals wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase is not exactly showing a lot of respect for the Kansas City Chiefs’ defense ahead of their meeting on Sunday.\nChase was dismissive of the Chiefs’ talent, admitting that they run a lot of double teams and are good at nullifying Cincinnati’s strengths. He implied that scheme was the reason for their success against the Bengals, and argued that they lack any real impact talent on that side of the ball.\nJa’Marr Chase had quite the edge after practice today addressing reporters. Said Chiefs don’t have anyone that stands out on defense. “It’s not really like have a Jalen Ramsey on their squad.”\n[pic.twitter.com/1kurBwcOLF]\n— Mike Petraglia (@Trags)\n[December 28, 2023]\n“It’s not like they got a Jalen Ramsey on their squad,” Chase said.\nChase shrugged off the prospect of the Chiefs using his comments as motivation.\nJa’Marr Chase didn’t back track at all when asked about his assessment of Chiefs defense. “They can take it how they want. I don’t care. … I’m not Ironman. I can’t throw the ball to myself. It’s a team sport.”\n[pic.twitter.com/KmnaKIcLYe]\n— Mike Petraglia (@Trags)\n[December 28, 2023]\n“They can take it how they want. I don’t care,” Chase said. “That’s why they double everybody. Because they can’t do it one-on-one.”\nChase isn’t necessarily wrong about the Chiefs lacking big names on defense, particularly in the secondary. However, top cornerback L’Jarius Sneed has had an excellent season, and Chase did acknowledge him as the best player in that unit.\nThe Chiefs and Bengals\nhave developed a strong rivalry in recent years. There may have been some worries that this game might not be quite as intense with the Chiefs struggling and Joe Burrow sidelined for the Bengals, but Chase is doing his part to ensure that is not the case.",

And good for them. These everywhere-active tech critics don’t just rely, for their on-trend position-taking, on vague, nostalgist, technophobic feelings anymore. Now they have research papers to back them up. They have bestsellers by the likes of [Harari](https://www.amazon.com/Nexus-Brief-History-Information-Networks/dp/059373422X/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3FUH9MKJM8OCP&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.uZ3blUGCyQ7GN-GR1-67mhtJ4TuKa6p_Z6r2AcbaXkCoh1wH6iEnmiB16kZQIFMOlj-tpmCsf1BaUTBsxWPthxB2cRgJA0R9SUjDbPVGUzGzVGMnoak5GqgkTNAFbhxdRfdQmRCsHNQnEQBT5lELJD9LmeiiJfAVsK80vB6j34P-oOfKlkTsei40XebETKdLnRI15I_TYsuqss180kSC4h_CtvVwE2gaRvTrDFDv3sPcWtJP3Iq4xTaiZDBafRYuTCrGwIUuW1ZAHdhFqwf1EEGt4fZmpmlyccnnGOpUb_o.Ni2sWplKUhaRusP4qXiZhS2EjaQWYYZHtorgwoqxtVg&dib_tag=se&keywords=yuval+noah+harari+books&qid=1731437613&sprefix=harari%2Caps%2C454&sr=8-2) and [Haidt](https://www.amazon.com/Anxious-Generation-Rewiring-Childhood-Epidemic/dp/0593655036/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2XC84X2480B3B&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.v8yHXjrkjHQj2wUrxVTCnHc1BWxUQp-QE_MU05-SXN_9v5bG7su5i2kcZexjOqy9V1GTaZE5fTDKSXx6L_rqyFDzGa_TinlIod3ZtDoEnkn9zjb4VIpaxN7jPUjyi2g7w618g6JWid7tNcGOH18vC5G_BKoTNDacn7GG-0VigQy55HTCRuhmiqp3HFdMK6GiZE3MoRfhXlI3VllK1KHg-YYhb3ATzLKnfEkMjAjKpeo.lj3y1dcMnxKuBxBcL6vU5EdJBxptAXXDSTMtd6EHvFQ&dib_tag=se&keywords=jonathan+haidt+books&qid=1731437632&sprefix=jonathan+haidt%2Caps%2C283&sr=8-1). They have—picture their smugness—statistics. The kids, I don’t know if you’ve heard, are killing themselves by the classroomful.\nNone of this bothers me. Well, teen suicide obviously does, it's horrible, but it’s not hard to debunk arguments blaming technology. What is hard to debunk, and what does bother me, is the one exception, in my estimation, to this rule: the anti-tech argument offered by the modern-day philosopher.\nBy philosopher, I don’t mean some stats-spouting writer of glorified self-help. I mean a deepest-level, ridiculously learned overanalyzer, someone who breaks down problems into their relevant bits so that, when those bits are put back together, nothing looks quite the same. Descartes didn’t just blurt out “I think, therefore I am” off the top of his head. He had to go as far into his head as he humanly could, stripping away everything else, before he could arrive at his classic one-liner. (Plus God. People always seem to forget that Descartes, inventor of the so-called rational mind, couldn’t strip away God.)\nFor someone trying to marshal a case against technology, then, a Descartes-style line of attack might go something like this: When we go as far into the technology as we can, stripping everything else away and breaking the problem down into its constituent bits, where do we end up? Exactly there, of course: at the literal bits, the 1s and 0s of digital computation. And what do bits tell us about the world? I’m simplifying here, but pretty much: everything. Cat or dog. Harris or Trump. Black or white. Everyone thinks in binary terms these days. Because that’s what’s enforced and entrenched by the dominant machinery.\nOr so goes, in brief, the snazziest argument against digital technology: “I binarize,” the computers teach us, “therefore I am.” Certain technoliterates have been venturing versions of this Theory of Everything for a while now; earlier this year, an English professor at Dartmouth, Aden Evens, published what is, as far as I can tell, its first properly philosophical codification, [The Digital and Its Discontents](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Its-Discontents-Electronic-Mediations/dp/1517916321/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3KH8OAZ9F6AWP&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.OWt9UBgziPP6ScSSu1pu1w.ayiOFhWRIKajKya7U6Nj34uCBU4rn2-OClZiyN0Yhok&dib_tag=se&keywords=digital+and+discontents+aden+evens&qid=1731437649&sprefix=digital+and+discontents+aden+eve%2Caps%2C258&sr=8-1). I’ve chatted a bit with Evens. Nice guy. Not a technophobe, he claims, but still: It’s clear he’s world-historically distressed by digital life, and he roots that distress in the fundaments of the technology.\nI might’ve agreed, [once](https://www.wired.com/story/why-you-hate-media-technically-speaking/). Now, as I say: I’m bothered. I’m unsatisfied. The more I think about the technophilosophy of Evens et al., the less I want to accept it. Two reasons for my dissatisfaction, I think. One: Since when do the base units of anything dictate the entirety of its higher-level expression? Genes, the base units of life, only account for some submajority percentage of how we develop and behave. Quantum-mechanical phenomena, the base units of physics, have no bearing on my physical actions. (Otherwise I’d be walking through walls—when I wasn’t, half the time, being dead.) So why must binary digits define, for all time, the limits of computation, and our experience of it? New behaviors always have a way, when complex systems interact, of mysteriously emerging. Nowhere in the individual bird can you find the flocking algorithm! Turing himself said you can’t look at computer code and know, completely, what’ll happen.\nAnd two: Blaming technology’s discontents on the 1s and 0s treats the digital as an endpoint, as some sort of logical conclusion to the history of human thought—as if humanity, as Evens suggests, had finally achieved the dreams of an Enlightened rationality. There’s no reason to believe such a thing. Computing was, for most of its history, not digital. And, if [predictions about an analog comeback](https://www.wired.com/story/unbelievable-zombie-comeback-analog-computing/) are right, it won’t stay purely digital for much longer. I’m not here to say whether computer scientists should or shouldn’t be evolving chips analogically, only to say that, were it to happen, it’d be silly to claim that all the binarisms of modern existence, so thoroughly inculcated in us by our digitized machinery, would suddenly collapse into nuance and glorious analog complexity. We invent technology. Technology doesn’t invent us.\nUnless, of course, we really are living in a simulation. Sometimes [I suspect we are](https://www.wired.com/story/living-in-a-simulation/). Two more things to say about that. One: Our simulation is definitely running on analog chips. And two: We’re back to Descartes. He thought, therefore he was, but he couldn’t quite exist separate from that which can’t be stripped away: his simulator, his God. To hate technology is to hate creation itself.\nTime Travel\nUh oh, in my [2022 piece about the simulation argument](https://www.wired.com/story/living-in-a-simulation/), I suggested that reality is boilable-down to bits: “In the beginning, after all, God created light and darkness,” I wrote. “Translation: The simulator created 1s and 0s.” Decide for yourself how literal I was being.\nAsk Me One Thing\nOne reader wants to know how nice we should be to the artificial intelligences. Should we thank chatbots? Not kick robots? Say hello and goodbye to self-driving cars? It’s a modern-day version of Pascal’s famous wager: Believe in God just in case. Let me introduce WIRED’s Wager: Respect the computers just in case.\nYou can submit questions to [mail@wired.com](mailto:mail@wired.com?subject=ASK%20LEVY).

    "text": "Unusually large waves are hitting California shores as powerful storms pass through the region.\nWaves over 20ft high poured over seawalls and the tops of low cliffs along the Pacific coast, flooding nearby streets and leaving many injured. In a video taken on Thursday morning by Ventura native Colin Hogue, people are seen fleeing Pierpont beach – just north of Los Angeles – as a monstrous rogue wave engulfs the area.\nSevere rainstorms hit southern California, with more to come\nRead more Hogue called the scene “horrific”.\n“There was a lot of screaming, a lot of yelling, a lot of cussing. I didn’t know how far this was going to go,” Hogue said. “I thought to myself ‘this is a tsunami.’”\nThe Ventura county fire department reported eight people were transported to local hospitals after coming in close contact with the massive wave.\nAndy Vansciver, a VCFD firefighter, told KTLA5: “I think a lot of lessons were learned today when you look at that video of the importance of heeding on to the warnings of giving the ocean some respect.”\nLarge debris has led to road closures in the path of the waves. As a result, a coastal flood advisory and a high surf warning are in effect until Friday for more than 6 million people in parts of California and Oregon.\nEvacuation warnings were also issued in counties along the coast of the state, including Santa Cruz, Marin and Ventura.\nIn Santa Cruz, the local news station KSBW Action News 8 captured a powerful wave that flung two nearby children into a bush.\nThis video is a prime example of why we urge people to stay AWAY from the water! Waves can EASILY knock people down and sweep them away.\nUse extreme caution! These waves are breaking at 28-33' and can easily breach the tops of low cliffs or seawalls like those seen here. #CAwx https://t.co/iN2dzUfaoX\n— NWS Bay Area 🌉 (@NWSBayArea) December 28, 2023 The worst is yet to come.\nOn Friday morning, the National Weather Service issued a warning: “Widespread precipitation will spread across the region today through Saturday, with the heaviest expected tonight.
