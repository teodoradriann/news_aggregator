    "text": "Cardiologist questions FDA’s approval process for high-risk medical devices\nThe technology used to diagnose, treat and manage cardiovascular disease is always evolving. The next big thing, it seems, is always just around the corner—and the next big thing after that is never far behind.\nThis trend has kept the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) busy over the years. The agency regularly approves new cardiac and cardiovascular devices, including those uses by general cardiologists and specialists in interventional cardiology, structural heart disease, cardiac surgery, heart failure and electrophysiology.\nThese approvals are an essential piece of the modern cardiology landscape—but one cardiologist is worried that the FDA’s standards may be too lax when it comes to reviewing high-risk medical devices.\nSanjay Kaul, MD, a cardiologist with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, shared his perspective in JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions, an American College of Cardiology journal.[1] Kaul pointed to several recent examples to make his point. He started with the 2024 approvals of the Evoque transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement system from Edwards Lifesciences and the TriClip transcatheter edge-to-edge valve repair system from Abbott.\n“Both devices significantly reduced tricuspid regurgitation (TR) grade to moderate or less,” Kaul wrote. “However, there was no difference in mortality, tricuspid valve surgery, hospitalization for heart failure, biomarker N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide or intensity of medical therapy. Thus, two new transcatheter devices were approved for TR driven primarily by patient-reported outcomes, which are prone to bias or placebo effect in unblinded trials.”\nIn addition, he added, the TriClip device was approved with input from an advisory panel, and the Evoque device was not.\nKaul also examined the 2023 FDA approvals of the Paradise Ultrasound renal denervation (RDN) system from Recor Medical and Symplicity Spyral RDN system from Medtronic, noting that a key advisory panel had endorsed the Paradise Ultrasound device, but not the Symplicity Spyral device. In addition, he added, both offerings were only associated with “modest” reductions in systolic blood pressure.\nExploring the recent history of FDA approvals\nKaul then detailed other examples from 2013 to the present day that highlight what he sees as a growing trend of cardiac devices gaining approval “despite either equivocal or negative findings in their pivotal trials.” His list included, among others, the MitraClip delivery system from Abbott Medical and the Watchman device from Boston Scientific.\nFrom Kaul’s perspective, these device approvals suggest the current bar for FDA approval is “too low.”\n“The FDA’s mission of promoting innovation and protecting public health is best served by exercising sufficient caution in mitigating bias in device trials and ensuring reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness before allowing these devices to be marketed,” he wrote. “The FDA must ensure timely launch (preferably at the time of approval) and completion of post approval studies. Finally, the FDA should be incentivized to exercise its newly legislated authority by the Congress via the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 to revoke approval of devices that fail to complete post approval studies in a timely manner or fail to confirm clinical benefit in post approval studies.”\nClick here to read the full commentary.",

    "text": "Sofía Benavides\n(CNN) — Un sacerdote de Florida está acusado de morder a una mujer mientras repartía la comunión durante una misa en la iglesia católica de Santo Tomás de Aquino en St. Cloud el domingo, en un supuesto “intento por defender el pan de la comunión”, según la declaración jurada del caso.\nLa policía dijo que inicialmente el sacerdote, identificado como el padre Fidel Rodríguez, le negó la comunión a la mujer, quien le había informado que “no había hecho los pasos previos necesarios para recibir el pan” en una misa anterior ese día. La mujer le dijo a la policía que regresó e informó al sacerdote que, de hecho, había hecho los pasos necesarios y que “ahora era aceptada por Dios, lo que le otorgaba la capacidad de participar en la (ceremonia)”.\nLa mujer dijo a la policía que el sacerdote supuestamente “se molestó y trató de meterse la ‘galleta’ en la boca”, según la declaración jurada. A su vez, ella dijo que intentó agarrar otro pan de comunión, que el sacerdote sostenía, cuando él la tomó y le mordió el brazo.\n“El influencer de Dios”: el adolescente italiano que la Iglesia católica quiere convertir en el primer santo millennial\nUn comunicado proporcionado por la diócesis de Orlando dijo que el sacerdote le preguntó a la mujer si “había asistido al Sacramento de la Penitencia (confesión), a lo que ella respondió que no era asunto suyo”.\n“En ese momento, el padre Rodríguez ofreció a la mujer la sagrada comunión en la lengua. La mujer metió con fuerza su mano en el recipiente y agarró unas hostias sagradas, aplastándolas. Teniendo solo una mano libre, el padre Rodríguez luchó por sujetar a la mujer mientras ella se negaba a soltar las hostias. Cuando la mujer lo empujó y reaccionando ante lo percibido como un acto de agresión, el padre Rodríguez le mordió la mano para que soltara las hostias que agarraba. Inmediatamente se le pidió a la mujer que se fuera”, continúa el comunicado.\nCuando fue interrogado por la policía, el sacerdote le dijo al oficial investigador que la mujer lo había empujado y que “no soltaba la bandeja de la comunión y la única manera que pensó para que la soltara fue morderle el brazo”, según la declaración jurada.\n“En la tradición católica, la Eucaristía es considerada ‘la fuente y cumbre’ del culto y la fe. Por lo tanto, el acto de participar en la sagrada comunión requiere una comprensión, reverencia y devoción adecuadas. No es algo que una persona pueda exigir arbitrariamente y ciertamente no es una simple ‘galleta’ como la llamó la denunciante”, escribió la diócesis.\nLa policía de St. Cloud ha enviado un resumen de los acontecimientos en forma de declaración jurada a la oficina del fiscal del Estado para su revisión. CNN se comunicó con la Oficina del Fiscal Estatal del Noveno Circuito Judicial para solicitar comentarios.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

    "title": "80 years later, D-Day veterans reflect on Operation Overlord",
    "text": "June 6, 1944, marked the first time George Mullins was ever in battle. The day before, he boarded a Landing Ship, Tank (LST) to cross the English Channel to France as a replacement soldier with the Army’s 327th Glider Infantry Regiment supporting the 101st Airborne Division for Operation Overlord. Mullins recalled that just before the troops loaded up, then-Maj. Gen. Maxwell Taylor, the commanding general of the 101st, jumped up on a table to make a speech. “And that was, ‘Boys, this is it. At a certain time, we’re going to be on the beaches of Normandy,’” said Mullins. “That’s how I got the news [about D-Day].” Six weeks earlier, more than 700 service members were killed during a secretive live-fire rehearsal of D-Day at Slapton Sands in Devon, England, known as Exercise Tiger. It was marred by German E-boat attacks, miscommunication and fratricide. Mullins would’ve been at that exercise but checked into his unit just a few hours after soldiers had already departed for the training area. The base was a ghost town when he arrived. So, with little training and even less understanding of what was about to happen, Mullins was sailing toward one of the largest combined military operations in history. Operation Overlord was planned in secret over several years and brought the full spectrum of military power onto the beaches of Normandy. The intent was to drive the German forces out of France and create momentum for an Allied victory in Europe during World War II. The operation’s success or failure fell largely on the shoulders of young men. “We were all 19. We were all greenhorns,” said Richard Rung, a Navy veteran and D-Day survivor. “I didn’t know what end was up in regards to fighting like that.” Rung’s assignment was as a diesel mechanic on the tank landing craft LCT-539, a vessel built in North Tonawanda, New York, only a few miles from where he grew up in Buffalo. Like Mullins, he didn’t know what he was heading into. He’d been in England for a few months, unaware of the D-Day plans. On June 4, his skipper announced that they’d be leaving for France the next morning. Rung’s LCT carried soldiers from the 1st Cavalry Division’s 161st Infantry Regiment and the 82nd Airborne’s 37th Combat Engineer Battalion. They all got seasick on the ride across the channel, he said. Rung, who is a DAV member with Illinois Chapter 12, thought they were just dropping them off at Omaha Beach. But at 7:30 a.m. June 6, when the front ramp of his LCT lowered, “it literally rained death,” he said. His boat was hit immediately by two 88 mm and two 47 mm shells that killed two soldiers and wounded two others. He said some estimates put the volume of gunfire at Omaha Beach at 20,000 rounds per minute. “I couldn’t believe the mess on the beach,” he said. Meanwhile, to the west of Rung, Mullins was landing at Utah Beach. As an ammo bearer for a machine gun squad, his job was to take a cart loaded with boxes of .30-caliber rounds from the ship to the shore. The flat topography of Utah Beach was a contrast to Omaha Beach’s cliffs, making the push onto land comparatively less dangerous and difficult, even while dragging a cartful of ammo. It was nothing like Omaha, Mullins said. “They run them boys up against that cliff rock,” he said. “They had no place to go.” D-Day was just the beginning for Mullins. He would go on to participate in the liberation of Carentan, Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands and the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium, earning a Bronze Star and Purple Heart along the way. “Victory didn’t come cheap for no one,” Mullins said. Late in the afternoon on D-Day, as Mullins made his way inland, Rung was aboard his LCT in the waters off Omaha Beach helping wash blood off the tank deck. “I guess the hardest thing for me was the blood,” he said. “That was the most bothersome thing. I wasn’t used to that kind of blood.” He and his crew beached their boat two days later. As Rung made his way onto land, what he witnessed seared into his memory. “There were dead bodies in row after row, plus arms and legs collected without any other remains,” Rung said. “My question to my buddy was, ‘How do you identify a man if all you have is a leg or an arm?’” Rung spent the next two months transporting troops, supplies and vehicles from the ships to the shore until the strategically important French port in Cherbourg could be taken back from the German forces and repaired. His time in service wasn’t over, though. About six months after D-Day, he and his crew were sent to the Pacific to help on that front, too. It’s been 80 years since D-Day, and the number of survivors still alive and able to give their firsthand accounts is dwindling. Though many were teenagers during battle, those who remain are near or past 100 years old. But as the number of survivors fades, Rung, Mullins and other D-Day veterans have worked to make sure the history and personal stories live on. They represent the thousands who were killed that day, the tens of thousands who died in the Battle of Normandy, and the hundreds of thousands of men and women who are no longer with us but whose service played a role in the ultimate Allied victory in Europe. With the help of his friend and caregiver, John Biancalana, Mullins wrote a book about his time in service. He especially wants people to know of the sacrifice made by those who died during Exercise Tiger. After service, Rung became a professor of history at Wheaton College in Illinois, and he has often publicly spoken about his experiences. Through the battlefield return program of the Best Defense Foundation, both men have been back to Normandy on several occasions to participate in commemorative ceremonies, remember their fallen comrades and meet the descendants of the French citizens they helped liberate. “I love the people there,” said Mullins. “They’re a people that appreciates freedom. … They understand it down to the little kids.” The 80th anniversary of D-Day may possibly be the last milestone commemoration veterans of the Battle of Normandy will see in person. For those who’ve gone, the trips have reawakened some difficult memories but have also offered closure, healing and introspection. “The first time I went back, all I could see is dead bodies, and they weren’t there,” Rung said as he recalled looking down at Omaha Beach decades removed from his time on LCT-539. But on his most recent trip, he asked to be taken to the Normandy American Cemetery to quietly sit in the middle of all the crosses. “I just wanted to be with all those guys that didn’t make it.”",

For example, Epic Games filed a lawsuit against a player who used cheating software and hardware during a tournament.\nThen, the devs went one step further and had a cheater post an apology video after receiving a permanent ban for unfairly qualifying for FNCS. In addition, the player forfeited prize money earned in the tournament, and Epic donated it to charity.\nArticle continues after ad Epic Games has taken a hard stance against cheating, but that doesn’t mean the developers don’t believe players deserve a second chance.\nFortnite offers a lifeline to banned players Epic Games Epic Games announced, “Starting in April, we’ll be moving to a one-year matchmaking ban for first-time cheating offenses, allowing former cheaters to learn from their mistakes while still punishing and deterring cheating. A second offense will result in a lifetime ban.”\nArticle continues after ad During the first ban, players can log in and use text and voice chat with other players but cannot matchmake or spectate.\nArticle continues after ad As part of the new policy, cheating bans that have been in effect for over a year will be lifted. Here is an explanation for all of the new rules.\nPlayers who have used cheats: One-year matchmaking ban for the first offense, lifetime ban for the second.\n Players who have used cheats and participate in tournaments: One-year matchmaking ban + immediate lifetime ban from tournaments + potential loss of past tournament winnings. A second offense of using cheats will result in a lifetime ban.\n Players who have sold cheats or broken other rules resulting in a lifetime ban: Nothing changes. The lifetime ban is still in effect.

    "text": "Los [Juegos Paralímpicos de París 2024](https://www.estadiodeportivo.com/juegos-olimpicos/) entran en la recta final de la competición. El próximo domingo 8 de septiembre tendrá lugar la ceremonia de clausura, pero hasta entonces todavía quedan varias jornadas y pruebas de diversas disciplinas en la que los deportistas buscarán firmar sus mejores actuaciones y hacerse con las medallas. De momento, son las 36 los premios entregados, de los cuales 7 son oros, 10 platas y 19 bronces. En la jornada de este jueves 5 de septiembre España ha sumado varios metales al medallero. Por la mañana ha sido Sergio Garrote el encargado de abrir la lata. Ya se hizo con el oro en la prueba de contrarreloj de ciclismo del miércoles, y ha querido completar un doblete gracias a su plata en la prueba de fondo de la categoría H2. Después, Álvaro del Amo también quiso revalidad su triunfo en París. Consiguió el bronce el pasado lunes en la modalidad de lanzamiento de peso, y ahora se ha colgado un nuevo bronce con el lanzamiento de disco, en el que además ha firmado su récord personal. Por la tarde, un histórico doblete en natación ha sumado dos nuevos metales. Nuria Marqués y 'Tasy' Dmytriv han logrado la plata y el bronce respectivamente en los 200 metros estilo. Con estas nuevas medallas, la delegación española ha conseguido 15 premios en este deporte. Además, con actuaciones muy destacadas. Entre ellas [sobresale el bronce de Teresa Perales](https://www.estadiodeportivo.com/polideportivo/teresa-perales-iguala-phelps-paris-20240831-462661.html), que ha logrado igualar a toda una leyenda de la natación como es Michael Phelps, con 28 metales olímpicos cada uno. Este octavo día de competición el medallero español finaliza con 36 medallas, igualando así la marca de Tokio. Sin embargo, la delegación española tiene asegurados 37 metales, gracias al podio de Ander Cepas en tenis de mesa, que aún tiene que descubrir de qué color es su presea. Ahora, el objetivo está en batir el récord de Londres 2012, en el que los deportistas paralímpicos regresaron de la capital de Reino Unido con 42 medallas. Este reto es posible ya que aún quedan varios días de competición. En los pr��ximos tres días hay varias opciones de sumar nuevos triunfos, por lo que hay que estar muy atentos a las actuaciones de nuestros deportistas.",

    "title": "El nuevo programa del pastor Allen Jackson anti-negatividad",
    "text": "[Allen Jackson](https://es.theepochtimes.com/focus/allen-jackson), el pastor principal de World Outreach Church en Murfreesboro, Tennessee, pronto transmitirá su mensaje a un rebaño mucho más grande. El Sr. Jackson presentará un programa de televisión llamado «Allen Jackson Now», que se estrenará el lunes 3 de junio a las 7 p. m., hora del este, en Trinity Broadcasting Network, que también transmite los mensajes de predicadores cristianos populares como TD Jakes y Joel Osteen. El pastor de Tennessee dijo que el programa ofrecerá una guía para las personas que buscan positividad y un diálogo constructivo. «Me parece un momento muy importante para ayudar a aportar algo de claridad sobre la cosmovisión bíblica o los valores judeocristianos al ámbito público y a los acontecimientos actuales», dijo a The Epoch Times. El Sr. Jackson, que está en su iglesia desde 1989, señaló que reconoce los efectos perjudiciales del panorama actual de los medios de comunicación. «Creo que es esencial que los cristianos tengan voz en el mercado de las ideas, y que no dejemos nuestros valores dentro del edificio de una iglesia», dijo. «Y por eso quiero invitar a la comunidad cristiana a la discusión pública de manera un poco más directa, no enojada ni beligerante, sino a usar sus voces. Y luego, creo, en la cultura mediática más amplia». Su nuevo programa tiene como objetivo contrarrestar la negatividad, proporcionando contenido que emocione e informe a los espectadores. El Sr. Jackson compartió sus pensamientos sobre el tema de la inmigración. «Creo que una frontera abierta no es una expresión de compasión. Creo que si cada vez que invitas a alguien a hacer algo ilegal, eso no es compasión. Cuando descuidas tu responsabilidad hacia los ciudadanos del país, no creo que sea compasivo», dijo. «Todos venimos de algún otro lugar. Así que tenemos una larga historia de acogida de inmigrantes, pero históricamente lo hemos hecho de una manera más decidida, intencional y ordenada», dijo, y agregó que la ruptura del orden en la frontera está conduciendo al tráfico de personas. «Estamos promoviendo la trata de mujeres y niños, chicos y chicas». Hablando de comunidad y del bien común, señaló que estos conceptos no tienen por qué ser etiquetados como cristianos. «Existe un conjunto compartido de palabras de vocabulario. Históricamente hablamos de estándares comunitarios, de que las comunidades tienen que establecer estándares de comportamiento dentro de su colectividad. Y lo hemos perdido en su mayor parte, y hay un intento muy agresivo y asertivo de reescribir el conjunto de valores bajo el cual vivimos», dijo el pastor, destacando la importancia de encontrar puntos en común. «Necesitamos un despertar que nos traiga nuevamente una claridad de valores que nos permita dar forma a un futuro que se imponga con libertad y tolerancia, ya que todas las tendencias actuales que están imponiéndose los están disminuyendo a diario». Navegando por la comunicación Explicó que las herramientas tecnológicas en constante evolución, como las redes sociales, brindan la oportunidad de comunicarse y compartir información. «Creo que nuestra tecnología aumenta tan rápidamente, trae cambios tan rápidamente, y cambia las herramientas, los medios y la disponibilidad de las comunicaciones, que aún no hemos descubierto los límites que debemos seguir. Eso nos ayuda a mantener nuestro civismo. Eso no es inusual en la historia cuando hemos tenido avances tecnológicos». «No creo que tenga todas las respuestas, pero creo que es necesario que haya otra voz en la corriente», dijo. El contenido del programa está diseñado para resonar en espectadores de todos los ámbitos de la vida, abordando problemas sociales actuales y brindando mensajes edificantes y constructivos. El Sr. Jackson enfatizó la importancia de equilibrar estos elementos para crear un impacto positivo. «Estoy hablando con personas del mundo académico, de la economía y del frente de seguridad, tratando de escuchar a las personas que realmente están trabajando en esos ámbitos para escuchar sus perspectivas y comenzar a dar forma a una narrativa», dijo. «Me refiero a cosas simples como decir la verdad de la que nos hemos alejado». Mientras el programa se prepara para su debut, Jackson dijo que es optimista sobre su impacto potencial. Reconoció los desafíos que supone lanzar un nuevo programa en el entorno mediático actual, pero mantiene la esperanza.

    "title": "Why two women were in Gympie's 'love tunnel' stormwater drain when they were killed by floods - with a third mate narrowly escaping with her life | Daily Mail Online",
    "text": "Two women were exploring a notorious 'love tunnel' before they were swept to their deaths by floodwaters - with a third female companion narrowly escaping with her life. Helen Bradford, 40, and Tanya Hehir, 46, were exploring the 2.4km tunnel near the Queensland town of Gympie, north of Brisbane , when they were caught up in wild weather produced by 'cyclonic' Boxing Day storms. The pair were washed back through the drain into the Mary River while a third woman, 40, was able to scramble to safety and call for help despite her injuries. A major rescue operation was launched with the state emergency service, water police, police divers and helicopters assisting in search efforts. Ms Bradford's body was found by swift water crews at at about 7.10pm on Tuesday near the entrance of the tunnel at Kidd Bridge. Ms Hehir's body was recovered near the Gympie Weir on Wednesday afternoon. Locals reminisced on time spent in the 'love tunnel' - an iconic local stormwater system and favourite of teenagers in the Gympie region. Residents said the tunnel was a old hang out spot where teenagers could spend hours exploring without the prying eyes of their parents. 'I could not count the amount of times as kids we walked through that,' one said. The women were washed back through the drain into the Mary River while a third woman, 40, was able to scramble to safety and call for help despite moderate head injuries Locals reminisced on time spent in the love tunnel (pictured) after a photo of the stormwater drain was posted in a Gympie community page in 2021 'My dad threatened me with death if he caught me down there,' a second wrote. A third commented: 'I'd spend hours up there... so dark, couldn't even see your hand in front of your face.' 'Go in for love come out with tetanus,' a fourth wrote. The 2.4km tunnel stretches from the banks of the Mary River to the town centre. According to locals the drain has two exits - one close to the Gympie Civic Centre and the other near the Cullinanes Plaza. Ms Bradford worked at the Coffee Club and was a keen cyclist, runner and hiker who enjoyed climbing mountains and following wilderness trails. Ms Hehir was also a keen runner and outdoor enthusiast who had hiked the iconic WWII Kokoda track in Papua New Guinea. Both women were mothers with Ms Hehir having two children. Residents said the Gympie love tunnel (pictured) was a old hang out spot where teenagers could spend hours exploring without the prying eyes of their parents Pictured L-R: Victims David 'Mario' Logan, Mia Holland-McCormack and Stephen 'Taity' Tait Mia Holland-McCormack, 9, (pictured) died on Boxing Day night after being swept away by flood waters when she jumped over the back fence of her family's home in Rochester South In total, seven Queenslanders and three Victorians have been killed in the storms. The youngest victim of the 'mini-cyclones' that hit southeast Queensland was nine-year-old Mia Holland-McCormack who was swept into a drain on Boxing Day. Mia, who was severely autistic, was reported missing earlier that afternoon after she jumped the fence of her house in Rochedale South, in southeast Brisbane. Earlier on Thursday, the third victim of a boating tragedy caused by the 'mini-cyclone' was identified as 48-year-old Robert Holden. Mr Holden died alongside former Queensland rugby union players David Logan and Stephen Tait when their boat capsized on Brisbane's Moreton Bay on Boxing Day. Robert Holden (pictured with wife Michelle) has been identified as the third victim of a boat capsize that occurred during wild storms on Boxing Day Mr Holden is being remembered as a 'great man who always put others' needs above himself' The deceased men were part of a group of 11 mates who were thrown in the water near Green Island, when 100km/h winds struck the area and shrunk visibility. While the eight others onboard were rescued, the bodies of Mr Logan, Mr Tait and Mr Holden were only able to be recovered in the storm's aftermath. Queensland Police Acting Chief Superintendent Andrew Pilotto said it would have been an awful last few moments for the three men. 'There were reports people saw it happen … but the conditions were horrific and visibility would have been down to metres,' he said. 'I know the winds were over 100km/h … I've been out on the bay in half that and the swell is insane. I can imagine it was tremendous.'",
