    "text": "The Chicago White Sox will have a new left-handed option in the bullpen after signing reliever Tim Hill to a one-year, $1.8 million deal on Thursday, a source confirmed to the Tribune.\nThe team announced the deal Thursday afternoon. In the corresponding move, the Sox designated right-hander Declan Cronin for assignment.\nHill, 33, has a career 16-14 record with a 4.16 ERA and four saves in 320 games during six seasons with the Kansas City Royals (2018-19) and San Diego Padres (2020-23). He has 208 strikeouts and 84 walks in 255 1/3 career innings.\nLeft-handed hitters have a career .223/.302/.304 slash line against Hill.\nHill made a career-high 78 appearances in 2021, going 6-6 with a 3.62 ERA for the Padres. He was 1-4 with a 5.48 ERA in 48 outings in 2023. He missed most of the second half of the season with a sprained left finger that required surgery on Sept. 20.\nESPN’s Jeff Passan first reported the signing .\nAaron Bummer, Garrett Crochet, Tanner Banks and Sammy Peralta were among the left-handed relievers the Sox utilized in 2023. In November, the Sox traded Bummer to the Atlanta Braves for infielders Nicky Lopez and Braden Shewmake, right-handed pitcher Michael Soroka , left-hander Jared Shuster and minor-league pitcher Riley Gowens.\nCronin went 0-1 with a 9.00 ERA and eight strikeouts in nine outings for the Sox in 2023 . The team’s 40-man roster remains at 40.\n()",

    "text": "Treatment emerges for rare, symptomless heart condition in Cytokinetics drug trial [James Powel](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12244761002/james-powel/) A new drug to treat a rare heart condition may be set to go before the Food and Drug Administration. Pharmaceutical company Cytokinetics [announced Wednesday](https://ir.cytokinetics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cytokinetics-announces-positive-results-sequoia-hcm-pivotal) that its drug aficamten produced, \"statistically significant and clinically meaningful\" results in the phase three trial of the [drug](/story/news/2023/12/25/weight-loss-abortion-drug-prices-psychedelics-hot-topics-of-2024/72027935007/). Aficamten is intended to treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a condition that thickens the heart muscle and is present in .2% of the world's population, [according to the National Institute of Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430788/). The company said in its press release that full results of the study would be presented at, \"an upcoming medical conference.\" If the drug does make it to market it would compete against Bristol Meyer's drug Camzyos. \"A therapy like aficamten that improves exercise capacity in a clinically meaningful manner, absent low (left ventricular ejection fraction) events that interrupt treatment, should be a welcome addition for HCM patients as well as the clinicians who treat them,\" Martin Maron, M.D., Director of the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Center at Lahey Hospital and Medical Center in Burlington, Massachusetts and principal investigator for the trial said. Cytokinetics stock closed down a quarter of a percent at [$83.24 per share](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CYTK) Thursday but is still up significantly from [Tuesday's close of $45.71](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CYTK/history?p=CYTK). What did the phase three trial find? Patients in the trial arm saw improvement in exercise tolerance, peak oxygen uptake and \"clinically meaningful improvements\" in the study's secondary endpoints including participant's Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score, according to the release. The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score is a test that measures, \"symptoms, physical and social limitations, and quality of life in patients with heart failure,\" [according to the Journal of American College of Cardiology](https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.09.542). Serious adverse effects occurred in 5.6% of people in the trial arm and 9.3% of people in the placebo arm. What is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy? Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a condition that causes the heart muscle to thicken and makes it more difficult to pump blood, [according to the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350198). The condition is usually caused by genetics and does not cause symptoms in many cases. Symptoms, if they are experienced, can include: - Chest pain - Fainting - Heart murmur - Sensation of fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeats (palpitations) - Shortness of breath The Mayo Clinic recommends seeking immediate medical attention if a person is experiencing rapid or irregular heartbeat, difficulty breathing or chest pain. Loyola Marymount basketball star [Hank Gathers](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2017/1201/p738.html) was killed by a cardiac arrest during a game in 1990 and his autopsy found that he had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Oklahoma City Thunder [draft pick](https://www.nba.com/thunder/news/release-johnson-230707) and former Florida Gator and Kansas State Wildcat star Keyonte Johnson was [diagnosed with the condition](https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/2023/06/23/okc-thunder-voices-zero-concerns-over-keyontae-johnsons-heart-condition/) after collapsing in a game in 2020.",

    "text": "Ours is an industry where announcements of games getting delayed never seem to take anyone by surprise, on account of how frequently they happen- which is why it’s always nice to find an outlier. Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku recently showcased a new gameplay trailer for the upcoming Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii , and announced that the action-adventure title’s release has also been brought forward by a week.\nNow, in a separate video, RGG Studio head Masayoshi Yokoyama has elaborated on the reasons behind the game releasing a week ahead of time, explaining that development is actually going better than the studio had planned.\nInterestingly enough, however, Yokoyama also seems to suggest that the game’s release date would change so that it would no longer clash with Monster Hunter Wilds , which releases on February 28, the day that Like a Dragon was previously set to come out. Of course, he did not specifically name the Capcom action RPG, but stated that RGG Studio and Sega wants players to be able to play “the game that comes after it, with peace of mind.”\n“We have decided to bring forward the release date by a week to February 21, 2025,” Yokoyama said. “Of course, this is partly because development is progressing more smoothly than expected, but we also wanted to deliver the game to players around the world as soon as possible. We wanted you to be able to play the game that comes after it, with peace of mind. With the support of everyone involved at Sega, both internal and external, we have been able to make this a reality.”\nUpon its release in February, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC.",
