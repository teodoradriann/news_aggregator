    "text": "Hyderabad wraps up Ganesha immersion, 40,000 more idols were immersed this year Telangana DC Correspondent 19 Sep 2024 6:31 PM GMT x Ganesha immersion at Hussainsagar continued well into the early morning of Thursday as the idol was immersed around 7 am. (Image: DC) Hyderabad: The Ganesha immersion at Hussainsagar continued well into the early morning of Thursday as the idol was immersed around 7 am. Over 40,000 more idols were immersed in the three police commissionerates compared to the previous year.\nAround 50 idols were immersed at each spot from Wednesday night till early Thursday at Hussainsagar. By evening only one crane was present at Tank Bund and that too would be removed, said an official present at the site. “We will head home around 2 pm,” said Bhaskar G, a crane operator, with exhaustion in his voice.\nThe situation was the same at other city lakes including Saroornagar, Kapra, Mir Alam and IDPL with nimajjanam almost ending by Wednesday evening. There were hardly any idols for nimajjanam at the artificial ponds too.\nWhile Ganesha idols and trucks dominated People's Plaza for days, the acoustics of the space had subtly changed. On Thursday, for the first time, the azaan from the nearby Maqta Muslim residential area could be heard. This was not the only shift as the images on the road had also changed as the city marked the celebration of Milad-un-Nabi, which had been postponed from September 16.\nThe Maqta area which is located just beneath Necklace Road, adds a notable spatial and cultural dynamic to the immersion site of People’s Plaza. The elevation, with a dividing parapet wall covered in graffiti, separates the two spaces, yet today, the community had spilled over to the main road. As Ganesha idol immersions wrapped up, many Muslims were seen riding bikes with green flags, a common sight during Milad-un-Nabi.\n“Ganesh idol immersion was quite something. Noisy for sure, but being a part of this cosmopolitan city means cooperation and brotherhood, the two festivals whether Milad or Ganesha, we like celebrating both with equal mirth,” said a resident of Maqta area on the condition of anonymity.\nRachakonda police commissioner Sudheer Babu stated that the Ganesha immersion celebrations were concluded in peace and lauded the collective efforts of the respective departments. He said the IT cell was monitoring the situation at the field level via CCTV cameras.\n( Source : Deccan Chronicle )",

    "text": "Turmeric prices experienced a modest uptick of 0.41%, settling at 14198, driven by concerns of potential yield losses due to unfavourable weather conditions. However, the upside is constrained as buying activities have been sluggish, anticipating stock releases before the onset of new crops in Jan’24. Pressure on prices is also evident from improved crop conditions owing to favourable weather. Support is found in the form of enhanced export opportunities.\nThe location concerns of PM Modi's Turmeric Board in Telangana have sparked worries among Maharashtra farmers, impacting sentiment. The overall crop condition is deemed satisfactory, with the harvest expected from January to March. Current buying levels and decreasing supplies are anticipated to maintain price stability. Despite a 20–25% expected decline in turmeric seeding, exports have increased by 25%, driven by heightened demand in both developed and emerging nations. In Oct 2023, turmeric exports rose by 11.58%, but a 9.30% drop was recorded compared to Oct 2022.\nTechnically, the market reflects fresh buying, with a 0.86% increase in open interest, settling at 12355. The price is up by 58 rupees. Turmeric finds support at 14124, and a breach below this level could lead to a test of 14052. On the upside, resistance is anticipated at 14274, and a breakthrough above this level might propel prices to test 14352.\nAdd Chart to Comment",

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Coffee County, Tennessee from 1901-2000 was 39.7. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Coffee County, Tennessee experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Coffee County, Tennessee history.",
