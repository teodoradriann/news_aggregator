    "text": "The left is all in on abortion. Promoting abortion, supporting abortion, cheerleading for abortions, funding abortions, making you fund abortions and now this from the Democrat Party.\nThe Democratic National Committee (DNC) has pledged to devote $8.3 million to promote killing babies in abortions this election cycle.\nAccording to a DNC statement posted on June 24, the second anniversary of the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, Democrats are “investing millions to build up infrastructure across the country and help elect Democrats up and down the ballot to defend women’s reproductive freedoms.”\nAdditionally, Democrats have launched a “Red State Fund” to advocate against existing pro-life laws. The DNC has invested $4.5 million in the Red State Fund in the 2023-24 cycle, according to CBS News.\nIn Florida, a political action committee called “Florida Voters Against Extremism” has raised $190,000 to combat an amendment that opponents say would enshrine unlimited abortion into the state constitution. According to reporting by Orlando Weekly , the pro-life PAC has been funded in large part by donations from several Catholic dioceses, including the Diocese of St. Augustine and the Diocese of Pensacola-Tallahassee.\nPlease follow LifeNews.com on Gab for the latest pro-life news and info, free from social media censorship.\nThe Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops has been very vocal about its opposition to the abortion amendment, which is known as Amendment 4, saying in April that they “will work hard to oppose this cruel and dangerous amendment and urge all Floridians to vote no.”\nOn Monday, the two-year anniversary of the Supreme Court’s repeal of Roe v. Wade , multiple pro-abortion groups announced they will be pouring money into battleground states during the 2024 election cycle.\n“Two years after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated federal abortion rights, Planned Parenthood advocacy and political organizations announced they will spend $40 million during the 2024 election cycle,” stated Planned Parenthood, per CBS News Congressional Correspondent Scott MacFarlane.\nKTLA reported that the eight-figure sum is an effort to “bolster President Joe Biden and leading congressional Democrats, betting that voters angry at Republican-led efforts to further restrict access to abortion can be the difference in key races around the country.”\nPer KTLA, Planned Parenthood’s campaign “will initially target eight states.” These include the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\nThe other three states on Planned Parenthood’s list include deep-red Montana – the site of a key Senate race – as well as blue New Hampshire and New York , which both have competitive down-ballot races.\n“The spending plan is not an election cycle record for [Planned Parenthood],” KTLA further noted. “It spent $45 million ahead of Biden defeating Trump in 2020 and $50 million before the 2022 midterms.”",

    "text": "Gli azzurri piegano gli statunitensi Townsend e Young in finale in due set.NEW YORK (STATI UNITI) (ITALPRESS) - Sara Errani e Andrea Vavassori fanno la storia nel doppio misto. La romagnola e il piemontese sono infatti la prima coppia tutta azzurra di sempre a vincere una prova del Grande Slam. Errani e Vavassori hanno vinto questa sera il torneo misto degli Us Open, quarta e ultima prova stagionale del Grande Slam, in corso sui campi in cemento di Flushing Meadows, a New York. Il duo italiano, nella finale giocata all'Arthur Ashe Stadium, hanno sconfitto gli statunitensi Taylor Townsend e Donald Young con il punteggio di 7-6 (0) 7-5. Quanto mai felici e soddisfatti gli azzurri a fine match. Errani in carriera ha già vinto 5 prove Slam e una medaglia d'oro nel doppio femminile; per Vavassori è il primo titolo in un Major. Il piemontese aveva perso due finali (al Roland Garros e agli Australian Open), giocate entrambe in questo 2024. Stanotte andranno in scena invece le semifinali del singolo femminile. In campo prima la bielorussa Aryna Sabalenka, opposta alla statunitense Emma Navarro poi l'altra giocatrice a stelle e strisce Jessica Pegula, che affronta la ceca Karolina Muchova. Cresce intanto l'attesa per le semifinali del singolare maschile del Major di New York. Il match della parta alta del tabellone, ovvero quello fra l'azzurro Jannik Sinner e il britannico Jack Draper, è in programma domani sera, alle 21 italiane, sul cemento dell'Arthur Ashe Stadium. Fra l'altoatesino e il tennista di Sutton un solo precedente, datato 2021, vinto dopo due tie-break dall'inglese sull'erba del Queen's. In scena in serale, e quindi nella notte italiana, invece, l'altra semifinale, che è il derby statunitense fra Taylor Fritz e Frances Tiafoe, in programma sempre sull'Arthur Ashe Stadium non prima dell'una di notte in Italia. Qui il conto dei precedenti vede in netto vantaggio, per 6-1, Fritz. - foto Ipa Agency - (ITALPRESS). pdm/red 05-Set-24 22:51 .",

    "text": "Connecticut Port Authority celebrates clean audit\n1 December 28, 2023 5:25 pm • Last Updated: December 28, 2023 7:20 pm By Greg Smith\nDay Staff Writer g.smith@theday.com New London ― Leaders of the Connecticut Port Authority say it has turned a corner, as evidenced by a “clean audit” that projects a revamped State Pier will help the quasi-public agency turn a profit next year.\nRevenues from State Pier, which is being reconstructed as a staging area for offshore wind farm projects, are projected to exceed $1 million by the end of the next fiscal year, according to Hartford-based CohnReznick LLP, which performed the audit for the CPA for fiscal year 2023.\nDavid Kooris, the CPA’s board chairman, said that aside from the commendable financial position, the new audit should be a sign to taxpayers and state leaders alike that the CPA’s house is in order. The audit also determined there were no significant findings or recommendations.\n“For the first time, we do not have a speculative projection for what the finances of the port authority will be. Now we actually know what the revenue is coming in,” Kooris said.\nWith the cost of the State Pier project soaring to $309 million from early estimates of $93 million, the CPA has faced criticism and state oversight because of financial mismanagement under past leadership. Controversy started even before former tenants operating at State Pier received notices in 2020 to vacate and make way for construction.\nThe new audit comes on the heels of a state audit released earlier this year from the State Auditors of Public Accounts for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 that was critical of the port authority for allowing its construction management company Kiewit Corp. to recommend itself for some of the subcontracts at State Pier. Legislators reacted by passing a bill that prohibits the practice.\nThe massive construction project at State Pier is now nearing completion and already a working port, hosting shipments from Ørsted and Eversource’s South Fork Wind project. Ørsted and Eversource, who have jointly contributed $100 million toward construction costs, has also started making lease payments that will total $2 million a year for the next 10 years. New Haven-based Gateway Terminal, the company hired to run State Pier, is also paying the CPA a percentage of its wharfage and onloading/offloading revenue, totaling $380,000 in the last quarter, Kooris said.\nThe city of New London has started receiving payments as part of a separate host community agreement, $750,000 a year from Ørsted and Eversource for at least seven years. The city will also receive additional $125,000 a year that is a mix of a percentage of the CPA’s port revenues and compensation for municipal services.\nDespite the projected surplus of $1.1 million, the audit determined the port authority had an operating loss of $2.3 million, due to $1.7 million in depreciation of the facility according to the audit. Kooris said depreciation is calculated as an operating expense and a simple fact of a new facility whose value will depreciate over time.\nThe port authority’s board, at its last meeting, voted to continue a memorandum of understanding with the state Office of Policy and Management. While OPM’s involvement in the day-to-day operations is minimal at this point, Kooris said. “having them available as a resource… keeping the relationship going has no downside.”\nInterim Port Authority Executive Director Ulysses Hammond, in a statement following release of the audit, said “now we’re seeing all the pieces of this unique project -- a first in the nation -- coming together even better than envisioned.”\n“State Pier is not just back in operation, it has been remarkably transformed from an underused and deteriorating state asset into a modern marine terminal…,” Hammond said in the statement.\nPort Authority board member John Johnson credited port authority leadership, Hammond and Kooris, for correcting the course of an agency he referred to as a “startup” when it formed with “some opportunities to screw up.”\n“It’s been a learning process,” Johnson said. “I think having this report be so clean indicates we know what we’re doing.”\ng.smith@theday.com\nComments are limited to 200 words in length.\nPost your comment Cancel reply We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that does not contribute to an engaging dialogue.
