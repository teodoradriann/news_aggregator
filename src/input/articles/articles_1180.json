    "text": "Why is Eating Crab Gills Bad? A Seafood Expert’s Deep Dive Eating crab gills, often referred to as “ dead man’s fingers ,” is generally considered undesirable and potentially risky due to a combination of factors: taste, texture, and potential for concentrating harmful substances. While not inherently toxic in the sense of causing immediate poisoning, crab gills can accumulate heavy metals and other environmental contaminants from the crab’s environment. Their unpleasant taste and texture further contribute to the recommendation against consumption. Therefore, although cooking thoroughly can kill most harmful bacteria and viruses, it does not eliminate the contaminants that have accumulated in the gills. It’s always best to err on the side of caution and discard them.\nUnderstanding the Risks Associated with Crab Gills Crabs, like many marine organisms, filter their environment, and their gills play a crucial role in this process. Unfortunately, this also means that gills can accumulate pollutants present in the water, including heavy metals like cadmium, mercury, and lead. While the levels may not always be high enough to cause acute toxicity, chronic exposure to even low levels of these metals can have adverse health effects over time.\nFurthermore, the gills have a distinctive, unpleasant taste and a spongy, almost feathery texture that most people find unappetizing. There is nothing beneficial to be gained from their consumption.\nWhile the age-old belief that crab gills are inherently “poisonous” is largely a myth, the combination of potential contamination and unpalatable characteristics makes it a good idea to remove and discard the gills before consuming the rest of the crab.\nIdentifying and Removing Crab Gills The gills are easy to identify. They appear as feathery, greyish-brown structures located on either side of the crab’s body , underneath the carapace (shell). They are sometimes described as resembling “ dead man’s fingers ” due to their color and shriveled appearance.\nTo remove them:\nRemove the top shell of the crab. Locate the feathery gills on either side of the body. Gently pull them away from the body. They should detach easily. Discard the gills. FAQs: Crab Gill Consumption 1. Are crab gills actually poisonous? No, crab gills are not inherently poisonous in the traditional sense. They won’t cause immediate, acute poisoning. However, they can contain concentrated levels of environmental contaminants.\n2. What makes crab gills taste so bad? The exact compounds responsible for the unpleasant taste are not fully understood, but it’s likely due to a combination of the gills’ function in filtering waste and their unique tissue composition.\n3. Is it safe to eat crab gills if the crab is thoroughly cooked? Thorough cooking will kill harmful bacteria and viruses. However, cooking does not eliminate heavy metals or other chemical contaminants that may be present in the gills.\n4. Do all types of crabs have potentially contaminated gills? Most crabs have gills that filter their environment, and any crab could potentially accumulate contaminants depending on its location.\n5. Can eating crab gills make you sick? While unlikely to cause immediate illness, repeated consumption of crab gills containing high levels of contaminants could contribute to health problems over time.\n6. Why are crab gills called “dead man’s fingers”? The name refers to the gills’ greyish, shriveled appearance, which some people find reminiscent of the fingers of a corpse.\n7. What other parts of a crab should I avoid eating? Besides the gills, it’s generally recommended to avoid eating the internal organs (viscera) and the green gland (tomalley), as these can also accumulate contaminants.\n8. Is it okay to eat the yellow “mustard” or “butter” inside a crab? The yellowish substance, also called the hepatopancreas , is part of the digestive system and can store waste products, including potentially harmful toxins like saxitoxins. Consumption is a personal choice.\n9. Where can I find information about crab consumption advisories in my area? You can find information about local seafood advisories on your state’s environmental protection agency website or by contacting your local health department.\n10. What are heavy metals, and why are they harmful? Heavy metals like mercury, lead, and cadmium are environmental pollutants that can accumulate in living organisms. Even low-level exposure over time can lead to various health problems. You can find more information from The Environmental Literacy Council at https://enviroliteracy.org/ .\n11. Is it safe to eat crab guts? While some people consume crab guts, it is generally not recommended. Crab guts can accumulate toxins and other undesirable substances.\n12. What is the most delicious part of a crab to eat? Many consider the claw meat to be the most delicious, followed by the lump meat from the body and then the leg meat .\n13. Are crab lungs edible? Crab lungs, which appear as feathery cones lining the side of the body, are not digestible and taste terrible. Remove and discard when cleaning crabs.\n14. Is it OK to eat soft-shell crab gills? Most of the soft shell crab is edible, however, the gills should be removed, even in soft shell crabs. The exceptions are the mouthparts, the gills and the abdominal cover, which are discarded (“cleaned”). The remaining, edible part of the crab is typically deep-fried or sautéed.\n15. How can I minimize my risk when eating crab? Choose crabs from reputable sources. Follow local consumption advisories. Thoroughly clean the crab before cooking, removing the gills, viscera, and green gland. Eat crab in moderation as part of a balanced diet. By understanding the potential risks associated with crab gills and taking appropriate precautions, you can enjoy this seafood delicacy safely and responsibly.",

    "text": "According to House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter (R-Rainsville), the Beason-Hammon Alabama Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act (HB 56) undermined by the federal courts could get another look, if necessary. During an interview that aired on Wednesday's broadcast of Mobile radio FM Talk 106.5's \"The Jeff Poor Show,\" Ledbetter acknowledged that a win by Vice President Kamala Harris in next month's presidential election could mean action from the Alabama Legislature on immigration, including revisiting HB 56. However, he also questioned the federal court for gutting HB 56 and interfering with the State of Alabama redistricting efforts. \"[I] thought [House Bill] 56 was a good bill, to be honest with you,\" he said. \"It bothers me, to be quite frank, because if you look at what's going on with our court system — I mean, elections have consequences. You know, we have got the majority in the state, and even when we drew the district lines for the congressional districts, you know, that was done by the people that were put in office. And it was [over]turned by the courts.\" \"I think the three branches of government should stay separate,\" Ledbetter added. \"And unfortunately, I'm not seeing that right now. With HB 56 and with the district lines that we've seen, it was changed. I mean, the thing that the founding fathers meant was for separation. And I think the judicial is getting involved in the legislation, and I don't think that's right.” Jeff Poor is the editor in chief of 1819 News and host of \"The Jeff Poor Show,\" heard Monday-Friday, 9 a.m.-noon on Mobile's [FM Talk 106.5](http://fmtalk1065.com/).

    "text": "Daijiworld Media Network – Karkala (MS)\nKarkala, Dec 29: Locals intervened and apprehended a man who had been persistently stalking and harassing a young girl in the evening on December 27, near the city bus stand.\nThe victim, an employee at a private finance company in the city, had been experiencing harassment from Jagadish Poojary, a resident of Irvathoor, for several days. On that particular evening, as the girl headed towards the bus stand to return home to Nandalike, Jagadish continued his unwelcome pursuit. He obstructed her path and attempted to engage her in conversation, prompting the girl to object.\nWitnessing Jagadish's troubling behaviour, concerned locals took matters into their own hands, ensuring his capture, and subsequently handed him over to the police.\nPolice interrogation revealed that Jagadish Poojary is a habitual offender, having harassed multiple young girls in the past. The Karkala city police are conducting further investigations into the matter.\nDisclaimer:\nPlease write your correct name and email address.

    "text": "Hamas terrorists have reportedly attacked a bus carrying members of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, killing multiple employees of the aid group.\nIn a statement released late on Monday, the organisation described how a vehicle “carrying more than two-dozen members of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation team, local Palestinians working side-by-side with the U.S. GHF team to deliver critical aid, were brutally attacked by Hamas.\n“At the time of the attack, our team was en-route to one of our distribution centres in the area west of Khan Younis. We are still gathering facts, but what we know is devastating: there are at least five fatalities, multiple injuries, and fear that some of our team members may have been taken hostage.”\nSince its launch last month, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been backed by both the US and Israel, has delivered more than 140,000 boxes of food, with each box intended to feed a family for half a week.\n“We condemn this heinous and deliberate attack in the strongest possible terms”, the GHF statement continued.\n“These were aid workers. Humanitarians. Fathers, brothers, sons, and friends, who were risking their lives every day to help others. Our hearts are broken and our thoughts and prayers are with every victim, every family, and every person still unaccounted for.”\nThe aid initiative, which is backed by the US and Israel, has been strongly condemned by both the United Nations and Hamas. The UN has refused to work with the group, accusing it of violating precepts of neutrality when delivering aid.\n“This attack did not happen in a vacuum”, the GHF said.\n“For days, Hamas has openly threatened our team, our aid workers, and the civilians who receive aid from us. These threats were met with silence. The GHF holds Hamas fully responsible for taking the lives of our dedicated workers who have been distributing humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people at the foundation’s sites in central and southern Gaza.\n“The world must see this for what it is: an attack on humanity. We call on the international community to immediately condemn Hamas for this unprovoked attack and continued threat against our people simply trying to feed the Palestinian people.”\nThe foundation promised to release more information when it became available, and pledged that “despite this this heinous attack, we will continue our mission to provide critical aid to the people of Gaza.”\nA statement from the IDF responding the news said: “We warned the world however we could: Hamas will stop at nothing to maintain control and prevent the effective delivery of aid. After their numerous attempts at spreading misinformation regarding the centres, intimidating the workers, and instigating violence next to the centres, Hamas chose murder and violence.”\nSupport your Jewish community.
