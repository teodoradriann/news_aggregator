    "title": "Meet the new Cowboys: Breaking down Oklahoma State’s notable signees in the 2025 class | Sports | stwnewspress.com",
    "text": "Oklahoma State’s early signing day went mostly according to plan, and 19 future Cowboys signed their letters of intent Wednesday morning.\nThe one hiccup came from former three-star quarterback commit Jett Niu, who flipped his commitment Bedlam style early Wednesday morning by signing with the Sooners. On the flip side of the flips, OSU picked up a commitment from Muskogee offensive lineman Miguel Chaves – previously committed to UNLV before late Tuesday night.\nOf the 19 players signed, 11 are on offense and eight are on defense with three guys coming from JUCO. Nine of the 19 are expected to be on campus next month as early enrollees.\nChandavian Bradley, edge rusher, 6-foot-4, 242 pounds - Hutchinson C.C.\nBradley might be OSU’s best pickup in the entire signing class. He comes to Stillwater from Hutchinson Community College in Kansas, where he’s the No. 1 ranked JUCO edge rusher in the class and the No. 13 overall JUCO prospect.\nPrior to his one season at Hutchinson, Bradley was the No. 84 overall prospect out of high school and committed to Tennessee over Texas A&M, South Carolina, LSU and many other power four programs.\nThis season, he was named an all-conference honorable mention in the KJCCC, and he recorded 23 tackles with 6.0 tackles for loss as a redshirt freshman. He has three years of eligibility left and will be an early enrollee. Oklahoma State has plenty of need for defensive line help with the departure of Colin Oliver, and Bradley could see the field early on in replacement.\nRashod Bradley, defensive end, 6-foot-3, 255 pounds - East Mississippi C.C.\nAnother defensive lineman from JUCO with the last name Bradley joined the class leading up to signing day.\nBradley picked OSU over Arkansas, South Florida, North Texas and others, and with his frame and experience he could factor in on the defensive line early on, like the other Bradley.\nIn two seasons at East Mississippi C.C., he combined for 32 tackles and 6.0 tackles for loss. Bradley has two years of eligibility left and will be on campus this spring.\nDraden Fullbright, cornerback, 5-foot-11, 175 pounds - North Crowley, Texas\nFullbright flipped to Oklahoma State from Tulsa just two days before signing day. He will enter a DB room that is set to lose Korie Black, Trey Rucker, Lyrik Rawls, Willie Nelson and others.\nPrior to his time at North Crowley, where he has helped lead it to the state regional finals this year, Fullbright played in Wayne County, Georgia, contributing at defensive back and running back. In 2024, he was listed as a Fort Worth Star-Telegram top-100 area player.\nFullbright is a three-star recruit who had an impressive offer sheet – including offers from Georgia, USC, Florida State and others. He will not be an early enrollee.\nRoyal Cappel, wide receiver, 5-foot-11, 175 - Cibolo (Steele), Texas\nIt will be interesting to see how this shakes out after the firing of OC/WR coach Kasey Dunn, but should Cappel stick around in Stillwater, he has plenty of upside.\nCappel’s frame and track speed (ran a 10.99 in the 100m last year) projects him as a slot receiver – where he produced for Cibolo in his senior year. Cappel racked up 1,200 yards and 13 receiving touchdowns, and he also averaged more than 30 yards per return on special teams.\nHe is a three-star recruit and picked OSU over Baylor, Missouri, Oklahoma and plenty others. Cappel is another early enrollee.\nChase Pinkston, defensive back, 6-feet, 195 pounds - Jones C.C.\nPinkston was a signing day commit and signee for the Pokes. He played one season at Jones, where he recorded 26 tackles, three interceptions and a fumble recovery as a true freshman.\nHe was a three-star prospect out of Oak Grove High School in Mississippi and had interest from OSU but no official offer. After his one season at a JUCO, Pinkston was re-evaluated by the Cowboys and they offered.\nIt’s worth noting that Pinkston’s father, Todd, is the running backs coach for the Kansas City Chiefs.\nMichael Riles, edge rusher, 6-foot-4, 245 pounds - Port Arthur, Texas\nRiles is the second-highest rated recruit in OSU’s signing class.\nWith his size and speed around the edge, schools such as Texas A&M, Florida, Texas and others all offered – but he stuck with Oklahoma State.\nRiles is the No. 52 rated player in Texas and will arrive on campus in the fall.\nCarl’Veon Young, linebacker, 6-foot-4, 215 pounds - Midwest City, Oklahoma\nOklahoma State’s highest rated recruit is an in-state recruit from Carl Albert.\nYoung has shot up the recruiting rankings in the last month, going from the No. 407 nationally ranked player to No. 219 as of signing day. In October, Young was an unrated recruit, and now he is a four-star.\nAt linebacker, Young describes himself as a versatile player that can be a factor in stopping the run and dropping back in coverage on pass plays. Young is looking to win a third straight state championship at Carl Albert, and he has more than 60 tackles with two sacks and an interception this season.\nYoung is the latest example of Oklahoma State finding a hidden gem before the rest of the country finds him. OSU was his only offer even on signing day – and as a four star recruit that’s almost unheard of.\nDJ Dugar, running back, 6-foot-1, 205 pounds - Leander, Texas\nDugar brings an interesting story with him to Oklahoma State.\nIn three seasons at Tom Glen High School, Dugar carried the ball 533 times for 3,800 yards and 48 touchdowns, but he did not play his senior season. In August, Dugar’s quarterback tore his ACL in a scrimmage. After watching that happen, Dugar took it as a sign to sit out his last year and not risk injury himself after so many carries his first three seasons.\nSo Dugar will come to Stillwater in January without having taken a carry in more than 12 months. The resumé and the accolades (two-time district player of the year) speak for themselves, but he’ll have to acclimate to competitive reps again. He was a three-star recruit and chose OSU over Arkansas, Kansas State, Missouri and others.",

    "title": "Navigating Sexual Orientation and Identity in College: Support and Resources",
    "text": "College is often a transformative period where students pursue academic excellence and embark on journeys of self-discovery and personal growth. For many individuals, this includes exploring and understanding their sexual orientation and identity. The collegiate environment can be both liberating and challenging, making it crucial to access adequate support and resources to navigate this journey.\nUnderstanding Sexual Orientation & Identity\nSexual orientation and identity encompass a spectrum of experiences and emotions. It involves understanding one’s romantic, emotional, and sexual attractions, which may or may not align with societal norms or expectations. This journey of self-discovery often begins or intensifies during college years as individuals have more autonomy and exposure to diverse perspectives.\nThe College Experience for LGBTQ+ Students\nFor LGBTQ+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer/Questioning, and more) students, college can represent a period of exploration and self-acceptance. However, it may also pose challenges, including discrimination, lack of understanding, or feelings of isolation. Creating an inclusive environment where students feel supported and respected is essential.\nSupportive Resources on Campus\nColleges and universities increasingly recognize the importance of providing inclusive and supportive resources for LGBTQ+ students. Many institutions offer LGBTQ+ resource centers, student organizations, counseling services, and mentorship programs. These spaces serve as safe havens where students can find community, guidance, and acceptance.\nMentorship & Community Building\nMentorship programs specifically catered to LGBTQ+ students can be immensely beneficial. Connecting with older students, faculty, or staff who identify within the community can provide guidance, support, and a sense of belonging. Additionally, involvement in LGBTQ+ organizations or clubs fosters a sense of community and solidarity.\nCounseling & Mental Health Support\nNavigating sexual orientation and identity can be emotionally challenging. Colleges often provide counseling services that cater to LGBTQ+ students’ specific needs. Access to therapists who are knowledgeable about LGBTQ+ issues can provide valuable support during periods of self-discovery and self-acceptance.",

He champions Congress's contributions to dam construction, digital expansion, and social justice. Endorsing Rahul Gandhi's leadership, he asserts Congress's commitment to secular values against Hindutva's ideology.\nVinaykumar Patil First Published Dec 29, 2023, 1:04 PM IST Follow Karnataka's Chief Minister, Siddaramaiah, articulated a clear distinction between Hinduism and Hindutva while strongly criticizing the BJP's portrayal of what he termed 'fake Hinduism.' Addressing the Congress Foundation Day celebrations at the KPCC office, Siddaramaiah highlighted the contrast between the two ideologies.\nDuring the event, Siddaramaiah emphasized that his recent attendance at a bhajan during Dhanurmasa in town didn't align with the BJP's propagandist narrative. He vehemently denounced the idea of 'soft' or 'hard' Hinduism, asserting that Hinduism stands apart from Hindutva.\nRanbir Kapoor in legal trouble for raising 'Jai Mata Di' slogan during Christmas cake cutting\nDirecting his criticism towards the BJP, Siddaramaiah pointed out that the Nehruvian era was the foundation of modern India. He questioned the BJP's development initiatives, highlighting that all the dams in the country were constructed during Congress tenures, contrasting with the BJP's lack of contributions in this regard.\nFurthermore, he lauded the efforts of past Congress leaders—Nehru, Indira Gandhi, and Rajiv Gandhi—in building the nation, attributing significant developmental milestones, such as digital expansion, to their leadership.\nSiddaramaiah discredited the BJP's claims of participating in the freedom struggle against the British, asserting that the Congress was the driving force behind India's independence. He urged people to grasp the distinction between the inclusive nature of Hinduism, embracing diversity, and the exclusionary approach of Hindutva.\nKarnataka: MP Ananth Kumar Hegde slams CM Siddaramaiah for using Tippu Sultan’s name in politics\nHe continued his critique by denouncing the BJP's alleged misinformation, especially regarding developmental achievements like dam construction and digital expansion. He highlighted that social justice in the country owed its existence to the Congress party.\nThe Chief Minister expressed confidence in Congress's prospects, endorsing Rahul Gandhi's leadership and predicting his rise to Prime Ministership. Siddaramaiah concluded by reiterating that the principles of Hindutva directly oppose the secular values enshrined in the Indian Constitution.",
