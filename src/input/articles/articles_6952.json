By the time first responders arrived, the RV was completely engulfed in flames, Tiki Island firefighter DeMarcus Foreman said.\nIt took first responders nearly two hours to put out the fire, Foreman said.\n“It just took so long with how much the storm was going on and how much fire was coming out of it,” Foreman said.\nOne person was in the RV when it caught fire, but no injuries were reported, Foreman said. Two cats and one bird that were inside the RV died in the fire.\nNo injuries or cases of smoke inhalation were reported from residents in the park living next to the RV that caught fire, Foreman said.\nThe RV struck by lightning was the only vehicle in the park damaged. The vehicle was destroyed, he said.",

    "text": "Parts of northern and central Europe continued to grapple with flooding on Thursday after heavy rain. A barrier near the German city of Magdeburg was opened for the first time in a decade to ease pressure from the Elbe River, and some animals were removed from their enclosures at a safari park in northern Germany.\nThis week's floods have prompted evacuations of dozens or hundreds of people in parts of northern and central Germany, but largely dry weather was forecast on Thursday. Still, water levels on some rivers caused concern, and they have continued to rise in parts of Lower Saxony state in the northwest.\nThe Elbe was nearly 4 meters (13 feet) above its normal level in Dresden, German news agency dpa reported. Downstream, the Pretziener Wehr, a flood barrier built in the 1870s on a branch of the river and renovated in 2010, was opened for the first time since large-scale floods in 2013.\nThe aim was to divert about a third of the river's water into a 21-kilometer (13-mile) channel that bypasses the town of Schoenebeck and Saxony-Anhalt's state capital, Magdeburg.\nIn Lower Saxony, the Serengeti-Park on the swollen Meisse River in the town of Hodenhagen faced flooding that began to affect some animal enclosures. Lemurs, prairie dogs and meerkats were moved to other parts of the grounds. Temporary dikes were put up to protect other enclosures.\nTo the south in Germany's Thuringia region, several hundred inhabitants of the village of Windehausen who evacuated earlier this week were cleared to return home after power was restored.\nIn the neighboring Netherlands, the Rhine peaked far above normal levels early Thursday at Lobith village on the German border but was expected to drop significantly over the next week, authorities said. Other branches of the Rhine around the low-lying country were expected to peak Thursday as the high waters move toward the sea.\nEmergency workers in the Dutch town of Deventer, forecast to be the hardest hit, heaped sandbags along the Ijssel River and closed roads to prepare for flooding. Several flood plains were underwater in the eastern Netherlands as rivers surged in recent days.\nIn Hungary, the Danube spilled over its banks in Budapest and was expected to peak in the capital on Thursday. Heavy rain has compounded the effects of melting snow.\nWhile some smaller rivers in western Hungary have started to recede, water levels on the Danube are predicted to fall slowly, with the peak downstream in southern Hungary coming only on New Year's Eve on Sunday.",

    "text": "Gold prices' surge amid wedding season gives nightmare\nGold prices continue to rise daily, causing concerns during the wedding season. Due to global market instability, gold rates have been skyrocketing and heading to breach Rs 80,000 per 10 grams mark.\nAs of today in Bhubaneswar, the price of 22-carat gold stands at Rs 77,400 per 10 grams while 24-carat gold is priced at Rs 84,400 per 10 grams. Last week, gold prices increased significantly by thousands of rupees.\nAccording to experts, global market instability is a major reason behind this surge. Investors seeking safe investments are preferring gold over the dollar, leading to higher demand and rising prices. If this market uncertainty continues, experts predict that gold prices may rise even further in the coming days.\nFactors Influencing Gold Rates\nGold rates in Odisha are influenced by various factors, including international market prices, currency exchange rates, and local demand. The state's rich mineral deposits, including gold, contribute to its significance in the precious metals market.\nOdisha's gold prices are also affected by state taxes. The demand for gold typically peaks during festive seasons and wedding periods, which can cause fluctuations in prices.\nAlso Read: Gold price spike creates pre-wedding season anxiety in Odisha\nGold Investment Trends\nWhile traditional forms of gold investment such as jewelry, coins, and bullions remain popular in Odisha, there is a growing interest in modern investment options. Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), sovereign gold bonds, and digital gold are gaining traction among investors.\nThese electronic and digital forms of gold investment often align closely with local gold prices, providing alternatives to physical gold ownership. The trend reflects a shift in investment strategies, particularly among younger generations, who are exploring diverse ways to include gold in their portfolios while balancing traditional cultural preferences with modern financial instruments.",

Face à la Tanzanie, Walid Regragui titularise Selim Amallah de manière assez surprenante, mais laisse sur le banc Bilal El Khannouss et Tarik Tissoudali.\nLes Lions de l’Atlas trouvent la première ouverture à la demi-heure de jeu, via leur défenseur central et capitaine, Romain Saïss (1-0, 30e). Le Maroc domine, doit se mettre à l’abri, mais attend la fin de rencontre pour le faire.\nOunahi (2-0, 77e) et El-Nesyri (3-0, 80e) valident la première victoire du Maroc dans cette CAN 2024. À vingt minutes du terme, le limbourgeois Bilal El Khannouss a remplacé l’ancien Rouche, Selim Amallah. Tarik Tissoudali est resté sur le banc.\nL’autre rencontre de ce groupe F débute à 21h00, entre la République Démocratique du Congo et la Zambie.",

    "title": "CAR T-Cell Therapy: President Lauds Low-cost Car T-cell Cancer Therapy | Mumbai News - Times of India",
    "text": "Mumbai: President Droupadi Murmu on Thursday dedicated the homegrown and affordable version of the anti-cancer CAR T-cell therapy, NexCAR19, “to the nation” and termed it as the “most phenomenal advance in medical science”. Murmu, who was at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, said CAR T-cell therapy has been available in the developed nations for some time, but it is extremely costly, and beyond the reach of most patients around the world. CAR T-cell therapy or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy is a form of immunotherapy and gene therapy. It requires complex genetic engineering to modify the patient’s immune cells (T cells) to eliminate the cancer cells.“What is new about the therapy being launched today, as I understand it, is that it costs 90% less than what is available elsewhere... The therapy being launched today is, of course, a major step —in fact, a new milestone in the journey of healthcare innovation in India. It puts us on the global map of advanced medical care as well as on the elite list of countries, which have access to this most innovative technology platform,” said the President. NexCAR19 was developed through a collaboration between IITB and Tata Memorial Hospital, the premier cancer institute run by the department of atomic energy, in association with industry partner ImmunoACT.IITB director Subhasis Chaudhuri lauded the efforts of professor Rahul Purwar, department of biosciences and bioengineering, who developed this therapy along with his team at IITB, at the startup ImmunoACT which he co-founded with his students, Alka Dwivedi and Atharva Karulkarand.Professor Chaudhuri said that the low-cost CAR T-cell therapy is a huge achievement for our country and for cancer patients in India, and it places India firmly on the global map of cell and gene therapy. He said that we can take pride in the fact that India is now one of the very few countries in the world that can make its own gene therapy for treating cancer.“This is a testament to the efforts of several scientists, doctors, nurses and others who worked together relentlessly over the last decade to achieve this goal for our patients,’’ he said. “Just like Chandrayaan-3 that launched India’s entry into the elite space club, the CAR T-cell therapy heralds India’s entry into the cell and genetic engineering group,” Chaudhuri said.Tata Memorial director Dr Sudeep Gupta said the treatment would help nearly 20,000 Indians every year, and its rollout is a milestone in the field of cancer care and genetic engineering. “This treatment is not only a scientific achievement of the highest order, but also has immense practical application. NexCAR19 will save many, many lives and wipe many, many tears,” he said.",
