    "text": "Germany sees 35% rise in Indian student interest amid global visa issues\nAs visa delays and scrutiny grow in countries like the US, Germany is emerging as a stable and welcoming alternative for Indian students. With a 35% surge in applications, officials highlight the country's transparent, affordable, and student-friendly education system.\nIn Short\n- Germany sees 35% rise in Indian student applications\n- Around 50,000 Indians study in Germany, a top five destination\n- German universities mostly have no or low tuition fees\nAs visa hurdles mount in countries like the US and UK, Germany is emerging as a preferred destination for Indian students seeking a secure and transparent academic path. Citing a sharp 35% increase in applications from India, German officials have reiterated their country’s commitment to providing a stable, inclusive environment for international learners.\nAt a recent press briefing in New Delhi, German Ambassador Dr Philipp Ackermann said, “In the context of the difficulties Indian students face in other countries, we have seen a sharp rise in interest for German universities and research institutions. Applications have increased by over 35 per cent in the last couple of months.”\nCurrently, around 50,000 Indian students are enrolled at German universities, placing the country amongst the top five destinations for Indian learners, after the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\nReinforcing Germany’s consistent and transparent approach to education, the ambassador remarked, “We are a very reliable partner. When it comes to studying or researching in Germany, we don't check your social media before you arrive.” This remark appeared to subtly contrast Germany’s stance with the increasingly strict vetting processes being adopted by other nations.\nA key draw for students is the affordability of education in Germany. Most public universities either charge no tuition fees or have very minimal costs compared to their Western counterparts. “We believe education is a public good, not a business opportunity,” Ambassador Ackermann added.\nDr Katja Lasch, Director of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) Regional Office in New Delhi, also addressed students and urged them not to rely on private agents for applications. “Most public universities in Germany do not work with agents. Our system is transparent and accessible. Students can get free counselling from DAAD and German university liaison offices in India,” she said.\nGermany currently offers more than 2,300 English-taught programmes, covering a wide range of fields including science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), where the country faces a growing demand for skilled professionals.\nAmbassador Ackermann noted, “We are looking for the smartest, most dedicated students—those who are eager to contribute and grow. And we see that in Indian students.”\nHe also highlighted post-study benefits, including an 18-month stay-back period for job searching and simplified processes for residence permit extension once employment is secured.\nPositioning itself as a dependable academic partner during a time of uncertainty in global higher education, Germany’s message is clear: Indian students are welcome, valued, and supported. \"Germany is very eager and happy to welcome Indian students. In these turbulent times, we offer not just world-class education but also a stable, inclusive, and trustworthy system,” Ackermann concluded.\n(With ANI inputs)",

    "title": "Novel Procedure Relieves Dog of Kidney Stones",
    "text": "Novel Procedure Relieves Dog of Kidney Stones\n“Case of the Month” – December 2023\nNoodle, a 3-year-old male poodle mix, was rescued in 2020 by John and Shannon Cogswell. After noticing blood in Noodle’s urine, they took him to their primary care veterinarian who discovered an abnormality on imaging of his kidneys, most likely the formation of stones. Two years of specialist referrals, medical treatments, and diet alterations followed with no resolution to his kidney stone issue, so Noodle ultimately landed at the UC Davis veterinary hospital in late 2022.\nOnce at UC Davis, Noodle was in the care of Drs. Carrie Palm and Dennis Woerde, board-certified internists with special interests in urology and nephrology.\nThroughout his 2-year ordeal, Noodle remained relatively healthy, and the Cogswells held out hope that the problem could be resolved medically. Surgery is not always necessary when a dog is diagnosed with kidney stones. In some cases, stones can dissolve with medical management, and in other circumstances, stones can just be monitored if they don’t appear to be interfering with normal kidney and bladder functions.\n“Dr. Woerde and the team were great about exploring every avenue before surgery,” said Shannon. “We tried many different medical and diet options. They clearly weren’t working, so the best step for us to take was surgery.”\n“By looking at the imaging, it was clear that it was close to a serious situation if one of those stones became dislodged and blocked his ureter or urethra,” John said.\nIn a similar previous case, Drs. Palm and Woerde achieved the first ever percutaneous (through the skin) removal of kidney stones in a dog. This novel procedure eliminated the need for invasive surgery, which is the current standard protocol of care in veterinary medicine. While the previous case needed lithotripsy to break down the stones before removal, Noodle’s stones were small enough to be removed without the shockwave therapy of downsizing the stones.\n“Luckily, Noodle’s stones were tiny, so they didn’t need to be broken up,” said Dr. Palm, co-chief of the Internal Medicine Service. “Instead of opening his abdomen, we were confident in our ability to gain percutaneous access to the kidney with a needle and a wire and utilize a scope to pull and flush the stones out.”\nSo, by spring of 2023, Noodles was set to become only the second patient ever to have percutaneous stone removal surgery, and the first without initial lithotripsy. Since this was such a new procedure, there was no data on potential outcomes.\n“They told us this was a very rare procedure,” John said. “That was a very emotional conversation between Shannon and I to make the decision to go ahead with the surgery.”\n“Drs. Palm and Woerde, along with the entire team, did a great job of walking us through the risks and benefits of this new procedure,” Shannon said. “Their collaboration gave us a lot of confidence.”\n“It was so important for us to have that confidence in the UC Davis team,” John said. “That team effort was so amazing throughout Noodle’s care – everyone sharing their expertise and discussing the different perspectives and points of view of the best approach for Noodle.”\nAssisted by the Anesthesia and Diagnostic Imaging Services, Drs. Palm and Woerde were joined by Dr. Bill Culp, chief of the Soft Tissue Surgery Service, to perform Noodle’s surgery. Ultrasound was used to gain percutaneous access to Noodle’s kidney followed by the use of fluoroscopy (real time x-rays) to establish access into the kidney, where the imaging allowed guidance of a scope into the renal pelvis to remove more than 100 tiny stones. After suctioning and flushing the stones, a stent was placed from Noodle’s kidney to his bladder to help keep the ureter open to prevent any potential stone fragments from blocking his ureter.\nThe incision needed for the procedure was so small that the tissue closed immediately upon removal of the needle, and no sutures were needed.\nNoodle was hospitalized for five nights, where he was cared for by a highly skilled team of veterinary technicians, and made a full recovery.\n“We appreciated the individual attention that Noodle received during his hospitalization,” said Shannon. “His caregivers would send us videos of him taking short walks. It gave us a sense of being there with him.”\nNoodle is now on a urinary/kidney health diet to hopefully stop any future stones from forming.\nWith two successful surgeries, Drs. Palm and Woerde look to increase the application of this new minimally invasive effort, even implementing the approach on horses. They have presented preliminary information on the procedure at one veterinary conference already and are pursuing publication of the data soon.\n# # #",

    "title": "Oral Factor XIa Inhibitor Disappoints for Secondary Stroke Prevention | MedPage Today",
    "text": "Factor XIa inhibitor milvexian did not provide meaningful secondary prevention over dual antiplatelet therapy for stroke survivors, the phase II trial AXIOMATIC-SSP found.\nIn patients with recent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), randomization to any one of five doses of milvexian did not significantly reduce the combined incidence of ischemic stroke or covert brain infarct on MRI at 90 days (range from 15.3% for 200 mg twice daily to 16.7% for 25 mg once daily) compared with placebo (16.8%), reported Mukul Sharma, MD, of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, and co-authors.\nNo significant dose-response was observed for the primary efficacy outcome, nor was one observed for major bleeding, the investigators reported in Lancet Neurology .\nParadoxically, a prior analysis showed that milvexian numerically lowered the risk of clinical ischemic strokes , not counting covert brain infarctions, in the four lower dose groups but not in the highest dose group.\nMilvexian's promise as an antithrombotic rests on evidence that people with factor XI deficiency have lower rates of ischemic stroke than the general population and infrequent spontaneous bleeding, the authors noted. Milvexian is an oral inhibitor of activated factor XIa and is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a half-life of approximately 12 hours. The hope is that it would carry a lower risk of complications compared with available anticoagulants.\nPrevious phase II trials had supported milvexian as an effective anticoagulant with a good safety profile. In another phase II trial, milvexian showed a dose-response relationship with prevention of venous thromboembolism after elective knee arthroplasty alongside low bleeding.\nHowever, in AXIOMATIC-SSP, the highest dose of milvexian was associated with renal adverse events and subsequent study discontinuation, Pooja Khatri, MD, of the University of Cincinnati, pointed out in an accompanying editorial .\n\"As expected, most of the primary outcome events within the trial were covert brain infarcts and, disappointingly, the results showed that milvexian had no dose-response effect,\" she wrote.\nAnother dose-finding study, PACIFIC-Stroke , showed similarly disappointing efficacy results for another factor XIa inhibitor, asundexian, over placebo.\n\"Together, the results of these trials suggest that factor XI and factor XIa inhibitors might not prevent noncardioembolic stroke. This possibility becomes more likely if covert brain infarcts are considered as part of the same biological spectrum as symptomatic cerebral ischaemia, but smaller or in less eloquent areas of the brain,\" Khatri suggested.\nHints of efficacy in these trials may have been \"spurious,\" she noted, though phase III trials may \"tip the balance towards benefiting patients with non-cardioembolic cerebral ischaemia.\"\nMilvexian is now under investigation in the phase III LIBREXIA-STROKE trial that is testing the 25-mg twice-daily dose against placebo in a targeted population of 15,000 stroke or TIA patients.\nAXIOMATIC-SSP was conducted from 2019 to 2021 in 367 hospitals in 27 countries. Enrollees were adults ages 40 and older, with acute ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA, seen within 48 hours of symptom onset. Participants had imaging evidence of interior or exterior atherosclerosis in a feeding artery and a premorbid modified Rankin scale score of 3 or lower.\nSharma and colleagues ultimately had 2,366 individuals in the study cohort. Their median age was 71 years, 36% were women, and 80% were white.\nPatients were randomized to one of five doses of milvexian, or placebo, for 90 days. All participants also received clopidogrel (Plavix) 75 mg daily for the first 21 days and aspirin 100 mg daily for 90 days.\nAn MRI scan was performed at baseline and at 90 days.\nThe researchers were limited by a study completion rate of 75% due to adverse events and COVID-19 pandemic-related difficulties. Another limitation was the low representation of women in the trial population.\nSharma's group also acknowledged the trial's reliance on covert brain infarcts as a surrogate for clinical ischemic stroke in the composite primary outcome, as these infarcts contributed most of the primary outcome events. The validity of this surrogate marker is still unclear, the authors wrote.",

    "title": "My Hero Academia Fans Still Don't Understand Bakugo, And 1 Controversial Scene Proves It",
    "text": "My Hero Academia may be coming to an end, but that hasn’t stopped fans from continuing to harsh on one of its most controversial characters. Bakugo Katsuki was the OG, the kindling, and the first horseman for people to hate on when the anime began back in 2016, and admittedly, for a very good reason.\nHe’s seen as a short-term antagonist who is actively working against Izuku Midoriya in his hopes to become a viable hero at UA, even going so far as to pick fights with him behind the scenes to prove himself over a former friend he thought was quirkless. Bakugo is a very complex character, and his actions throughout the manga and anime aren’t those that can be easily forgiven or explained from the moment he told Deku to jump off a building to not holding back in his fight against Ochaco Uraraka in the Sports Festival.\n“Bakugo’s Fight Against Uraraka Was Unfair”\nSome MHA Fans Are Still Mystified About How Bakugo Became A Hero\nThere’s no better way to showcase what kind of hero both Bakugo and Uraraka turn out to be than the original fight during UA’s Sports Festival. It is remarked several times in the show by their fellow classmates and heroes watching the fight that this was an extremely unfair matchup, casting more pity on the gentle and hard-working Uraraka. The one-on-one sparring matches were meant to put the students to the test on how they would handle other superpowered humans in a battle, while also competing to see who was the strongest.\nFor a majority of the fight, audiences both in and out of the narrative had to witness Uraraka attempt to dodge or tank Bakugo’s explosive quirk head-on. Even without equipment, the literal bombastic character has excellent control over the precision and blast range of his quirk, dealing significant damage to the stadium when it didn’t hit Ochaco, so one could only imagine that when she did get hit, it wasn’t a gentle breeze.\nRelated\nI Never Expected My Hero Academia's Most Controversial Arc to Be My Favorite One\nMy Hero Academia's most underrated arc happens to be one of its best, for a surprising reason that involves a few of the series' best heroes.\nWhile Bakugo could obviously go on to win the UA Sports Festival, he would receive backlash both in the story and outside of it. Some fans were at their wits' end with this supposed hero since he not only soundly defeated Uraraka, but would then go on to complain about his win against Shoto Todoroki. There seemed to be nothing good about his character. My Hero Academia, however, does see fit to punish him by not only showcasing how the audience was disgusted by his actions, and displaying him as a demon on the winning stage.\nBakugo and Uraraka Prepared and Acted Accordingly\nIn a Matchup That Challenged Both of Them, The MHA Students Made the Right Call\nAlmost immediately, all complaints and judgments cast towards Bakugo are silenced by their homeroom teacher and veteran hero, Shota Aizawa, or Eraserhead, telling the audience members that if they saw anything wrong with his students' fight, then they aren’t true pro heroes and misunderstand Katsuki being on guard. Uraraka herself says in the midst of the fight that she’s thankful to Bakugo that he’s taking her as seriously as he would any other opponent. Although he initially blames Deku for teaching her strange tactics, he later learns that she didn’t take up any advice offered by the mumbling tactician of Class 1-A.\nRelated\nMy Hero Academia's Ochaco Has a Surprising Motivation That Truly Sets Her Apart\nMy Hero Academia's Ochaco Uraraka has a different motivation than her peers that inspired her to be a hero, but her inspiration is just as admirable.\nThe only way that Bakugo was going to win against Uraraka was if he kept her at bay and made sure she never got close to touching him. Doing so would mean his instant elimination. For Uraraka, winning against the class's toughest student was always going to be an insurmountable challenge, but she devised a strategy to take him out by using the amount of destruction he leaves behind against him. If she couldn’t contact him directly, she’d use what she could reach and strike him down with bits of the arena.\nBy Criticizing Bakugo in the Sports Festival, Uraraka’s Efforts Are Undermined\nOchaco Put up a Fight Worthy of Being Acknowledged by the Strongest in Her Class\nWhat ultimately settled the fight was the difference in tolerance and stamina between their quirks. Bakugo had better training and time perfecting his control, and despite Uraraka wanting to continue the fight, the meteor shower had completely drained her. Her determination to fight, utilizing strategies against him, and being unwilling to give in despite what was said around her won Uraraka Bakugo’s respect.\nWhere do you see ‘fragile’?\nBakugo was more excited for the challenge presented in Uraraka’s battle than in Todoroki’s, given how the latter’s exhaustion wore him out. She was fighting on a physical and mental level that could compete against Bakugo, and yet when audiences see only a petite girl taking blow after blow, it just kills how momentous this scene was for both of the students' developments. Uraraka displayed momentous courage and wit to combat Dynamite McGee, it’s a shame the show doesn’t give her much development in later arcs where these two could have seen each other on equal or respectable grounds.\nRelated\nBakugo Was My Most Hated My Hero Academia Character, But One Season Of The Anime Made Him My Favorite\nWhen I started My Hero Academia, Bakugo Katsuki was my least favorite character, but one moment completely changed my mind about him.\nKatsuki Bakugo is always on the short end of the stick, and rightfully so, in some instances, but he doesn’t go unpunished for his more dastardly actions. He’s acknowledged for his strength but rebuked for his personality. In his quest to become a hero, he claws his way to the top, which fans respect in Deku’s journey, yet criticize in Bakugo’s. My Hero Academia nailed a lot of character development arcs, with Kacchan’s being at the forefront, acknowledging Uraraka at the Sports Festival for seeing her as a valid opponent with the quiet statement, \"Where do you see ‘fragile?’\"\nMy Hero Academia\n- Movie(s)\n- My Hero Academia: Two Heroes (2018), My Hero Academia: Heroes Rising (2019), My Hero Academia: World Heroes' Mission (2021)\n- First Film\n- My Hero Academia: Two Heroes (2018)\n- Cast\n- Daiki Yamashita, Kenta Miyake, Nobuhiko Okamoto, Ayane Sakura, Yûki Kaji, Aoi Yuki, Kaito Ishikawa, Toshiki Masuda, Marina Inoue, Yoshimasa Hosoya\n- TV Show(s)\n- My Hero Academia\n- Video Game(s)\n- My Hero Academia: Battle for All, My Hero One's Justice, My Hero One's Justice 2",

É o terceiro filho da agricultora Daniela Barbosa Nobre.O parto, realizado por cesárea, ocorreu sem complicações, segundo informações do hospital. Bebês com mais de 4 kg são considerados 'macrossômicos', condição que ocorre em cerca de 5% dos recém-nascidos no Brasil.Em entrevista divulgada pela Secretaria de Saúde do Ceará, Daniela contou que, a partir do sétimo mês de gestação, começou a sentir um cansaço intenso e suspeitou que o bebê nasceria com mais peso do que os filhos anteriores. “A barriga estava enorme”, relatou.Mãe e filho receberam alta dois dias após o parto e continuarão sob acompanhamento de um nutricionista e de um pediatra.Embora Antony Gael tenha nascido com peso elevado, o recorde de maior bebê registrado no Brasil foi alcançado em janeiro de 2023, quando Angerson Santos nasceu em Parintins, no Amazonas, com impressionantes 7,3 kg e 59 centímetros.",

    "title": "British medic who died in Ukraine ‘devoted her life to helping others’ – The Irish News",
    "text": "A British woman who died as a combat medic in Ukraine “devoted her life to helping others”, her family said. Katherine Mielniczuk went to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, compelled to use her medical skills to help those in need. The 26-year-old, who graduated in chemistry at the University of Bristol, spent almost two years risking her life to provide medical supplies and emergency care to injured Ukrainian and foreign fighters, travelling to the most volatile stretches of the frontline and earning herself the nickname “Apache”. She died in the early hours of Christmas Eve in eastern Ukraine, her family said on Friday. Her death is not being treated as suspicious, they said. Ms Mielniczuk was an “inspiration in resilience and grace” and the “kindest and most selfless person one could hope to meet”, her family said. An online fundraiser has so far garnered almost £3,000 of £10,000 to repatriate Ms Mielniczuk, also known as Kasia, to the UK. Her family said: “It is impossible to truly convey what an incredible woman Katherine was or how deeply and widely she was loved and will be missed. “Kasia is gone, but the endless warmth, love and grace she brought to the world will never be lost”. In a Facebook post on December 23, a day before her death, Ms Mielniczuk asked her followers to keep Ukrainian volunteers in their thoughts, writing that “many of us cannot return home or celebrate Christmas”. She wrote: “The mental, physical, financial consequences of war are catastrophic and a kind word can hold tremendous power for us when we are losing hope and seeing tragedies daily. “We prioritise fighting for a free Ukraine, for a prosperous and fruitful future for Ukrainian children.” To support repatriation and funeral costs for Ms Mielniczuk, visit: https://donorbox.org/katherine-mielniczuk",

I find them mostly soothing and entertaining (World’s Deadliest Hunters condensed down to, ideally, 10-to-more realistically-13-pound bags of fur and cuddliness).\nIn addition to being a coffee shop with an excellent selection of caffeinated beverages and snacks, Press Paws also has it’s own cat room that houses and entertains several felines up for adoption through the Des Moines County Humane Society.\nThe cat room sits at the front of the room, and guests can either stare down the furballs through the plexiglass or pay an entrance fee to hang out with them for an hour, either for your own amusement or as an opportunity to find out if you might be compatible with any of the cats and consider adopting them.\nRead the rest of the story in the Friday, Jan. 24 edition of The Hawk Eye newspaper.",
