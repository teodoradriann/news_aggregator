While Infinix hasn’t specified how many models will be included in the lineup, industry sources suggest we could see multiple variants, including the Note 50X, Note 50, Note 50 Pro, and Note 50 Pro+ 5G.\nThe Infinix Note 50 Pro model has already appeared on Indonesia’s SDPPI certification website with the model number X6855, confirming at least one of the variants in the upcoming series.\nDesign and Specifications The teaser trailer provides a glimpse of one model’s camera module, revealing a triple camera setup on the rear. While complete specifications remain under wraps, an FCC listing has shared some details about the base Note 50 model. These include:\n9mm thickness NFC support Dual-band WiFi connectivity 45W wired fast charging capability AI Features Infinix has emphasized that the Note 50 series will come equipped with their AI technology, bringing useful AI-powered tools to users. Specific details about these AI features haven’t been disclosed yet, though rumor has it that Infinix has integrated DeepSeek-R1 into its voice assistant, Folax.\nHow Does the Note 50 Series Compare to the Note 40 Series?

    "text": "Prince Harry, who accepted the Pat Tillman Award for his Invictus Games initiative, has been praised for his new honour. The Duke of Sussex has also received a new tittle from the UK after accepting the award at a glamorous ceremony in the US even after around 80,000 people signed a petition protesting against the decision. Former royal Butler Grant Harrold, speaking to GB News, has given a new title to the Duke after Harry's speech at the event, claiming he is a \"gentle character\". In his acceptance speech, King Charles III's younger son praised the \"eternal\" bond \"between a mother and son\", and praised Tillman's mother Mary's \"advocacy for Pat's legacy\", calling it \"deeply personal, and one that I respect\". Defending Harry, the former butler to King Charles said the heavy criticism on the Duke by the veteran community will be \"weighing on his shoulders\". Harrold went on: \"This is quite a personal thing to him because obviously his acts of service over the years, including in Afghanistan, starting the Invictus Games, which is always what this word was connected to. \"He'll be aware of what's being said, of the kind of feedback and also of the mother who has obviously voiced her concerns.\" Reacting to Tillman's mother's concerns, he claimed she \"wasn't consulted\" on Prince Harry receiving the award. Harrold admitted: \"I wasn't sure if he would accept it, but obviously the advice he was given was 'why not?' \"I know how much it meant to him, with his involvement within the armed forces and setting up the Invictus Games. So to be given this award for those reasons, to my mind, makes sense.\" Acknowledging the backlash from the veteran community, Harrold continued: \"Obviously there's a lot of strong opinion about him, but I just feel it's a bit unfair to kind of judge him.\" Meghan Markle, Prince Harry receive new titles at Pat Tillman Award Matthew Wright was rushed to hospital after he suffered from crippling neck pain Kensington Palace releases Prince William, Kate Middleton's meaningful statement with their photos Matt Damon supports Ben Affleck's ex-wife amid marital woes with Jennifer Lopez",

    "text": "RUIDOSO, N.M. — Recent rains and cooler weather are helping more than 1,000 firefighters gain ground on two wildfires in southern New Mexico on Saturday that have killed two people, destroyed hundreds of homes and forced thousands to flee. Fire crews took advantage of temperatures in the 70s, scattered showers and light winds to use bulldozers to dig protective lines while hand crews used shovels in more rugged terrain to battle the fires near the mountain village of Ruidoso. The South Fork Fire, which reached 26 square miles, was 26% contained, while the Salt Fire, at 12 square miles, was 7% contained as of Saturday morning, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Full containment was not expected until July 15, per the agency. The wildfires destroyed or damaged an estimated 1,400 structures. Other fallout from the fires – including downed power lines, damaged water, sewer, and gas lines, and flooding in burn scars – continued “to pose risks to firefighters and the public,” according to a Saturday update from the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. Evacuations in areas near Ruidoso and road closures were still in effect. In Ruidoso, full-time residents will be allowed to return Monday, though everyday life won’t return to normal. “You’re going to need to bring a week’s worth of food, you’re going to need to bring drinking water,” Mayor Lynn Crawford said on Facebook. Deanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham were scheduled to tour the disaster area Saturday. President Biden issued a disaster declaration for parts of southern New Mexico on Thursday, freeing up funding and more resources to help with recovery efforts including temporary housing, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property and other emergency work in Lincoln County and on lands belonging to the Mescalero Apache Tribe. Much of the Southwest has been exceedingly dry and hot in recent months. Those conditions, along with strong wind, whipped the flames out of control, rapidly advancing the South Fork Fire into Ruidoso in a matter of hours. Evacuations extended to hundreds of homes, businesses, a regional medical center and the Ruidoso Downs horse track. Nationwide, wildfires have scorched more than 3,344 square miles this year – a figure higher than the 10-year average, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.

MAY THEY ROT IN HELL. AGAIN, MERRY CHRISTMAS!\" Biden, a Catholic who attends church regularly, responded to Trump on X on Thursday, retweeting a link to a news story about Trump's Christmas message with the comment, \"There's an expression they say in church sometimes: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.\" Theodore Bunker, a Newsmax writer, has more than a decade covering news, media, and politics. © 2023 Newsmax.

    "text": "Chris Wilder quedó conforme con la actuación del chileno.\nBen Brereton suma elogios en Inglaterra. Tras su debut en Sheffield United en el triunfo por 4-0 sobre Gillingham por la FA Cup, el técnico de los albirrojos se deshizo en elogios hacia el ariete nacional. Luego del compromiso, Chris Wilder dialogó con los medios locales y expresó su conformidad por lo expuesto por el artillero.\n“Nunca vi a un suplente tan feliz por entrar a la cancha. Que jugara 25 minutos fue estupendo”, aseguró, haciendo hincapié en la buena actitud que mostró el atacante en su arribo a la escuadra británica. El ex Villarreal prácticamente se bajó del avión a jugar. Fue anunciado oficialmente durante la jornada de viernes y el sábado ya estaba sumando minutos en el campo de juego.\nPara Wilder era imperativo sumar un delantero, ya que necesitan sumar puntos a como dé lugar en la Premier League. Por ahora son últimos en la máxima competición del Reino Unido. En esa línea, destaca las cualidades del futbolista de la Roja. “Puede jugar por el centro en un esquema con delanteros, como único punta y también por las bandas. Era muy importante que sumara minutos. Estamos encantados de que nos haya elegido, trabajamos durante mucho tiempo ese acuerdo. Quiso venir y jugar con nosotros”, remarcó.\nLuego se refirió a la necesidad de sumar unidades en la Primera División inglesa. “No hemos conseguido muchas victorias esta temporada en la Premier League, así que tenemos que ser constantes con nuestro rendimiento, sea cual sea la competición, para mejorar”, expresó al respecto.\nA sus 56 años, Chris Wilder asumió la responsabilidad de levantar al Sheffield United hace poco más de un mes y su arribo fue clave para Brereton, al insistir en la cesión del chileno, que en España estaba jugando muy poco. Para el nacido en Stocksbridge, el retorno a los albirrojos es especial. Antes había sido estratega de la institución entre 2016 y 2021, logrando subir de Tercera División a Segunda y luego a Primera. Tras ello pasó por el Middlesbrough y el Watford, donde no tuvo buenos resultados.\nEn esta segunda etapa en Sheffield acumula, de momento, siete encuentros, con dos triunfos, un empate y cuatro derrotas.\nSigue en El Deportivo",

    "text": "Over the last few years, there’s been a growing tension between law enforcement and some in the community.\nWe’ve seen calls to defund the police and a push to reimagine the way officers interact with the public.\nRecommended Videos\nOne local high school student saw that tension firsthand. That’s when he got behind a microphone to do something about it.\nJasur Talipov started the Trust The Badge Podcast two years ago as a way to build trust.\nHe’s recorded about 20 shows with everyone from current officers, politicians and citizens. He understands that there have been legitimate incidents that cast police in a negative light but feels the positive far outweighs the negative.\n“I think these conversations are necessary. It’s not hard to have them, but it’s key to have both sides come to a middle. Once you have both sides come to a middle, then you can start to see some solutions.”\nOn this day, he sits at a desk in the corner of his bedroom.\n“I have my headphones right here,” he says. “I just wear them during my interview and have my microphone right here.”\nTalipov wanted to take advantage of technology and a growing interest in the audio format.\n“Podcasts were very trendy when I started this in 2020. During the lockdown, they had a huge jump in listers,” Talipov said. “In a podcast, you can really hear what people have to say. It’s like the perfect platform for interviews.”\nTo understand Talipov’s motivation, you have to go back to when he was a volunteer with the Altamonte Springs Police Department at their Altamonte Mall substation.\n“I answered the phone and just helped the officers with what they needed,” Talipov recalled. “Sitting at the front desk, looking through the glass windows, I would watch the people walking through the mall.”\nThat’s when he noticed something that bothered him. “Some of the people seemed afraid just to be seen by law enforcement from inside the office. So it really touched me and made me feel like there’s a lot of distrust and I feel like there shouldn’t be.”\nTolipov says it’s an issue that needs to be addressed. He recites statistics about officer retirement rates, defund the police initiatives and crime statistics that have gone up in some communities.\n“It’s something that needs to be tackled before it’s too late,” he said.\nDeana DiPaola, COPS Coordinator and public information officer for the Altamonte Police Department, says as a volunteer, Talipov was always eager to help so his new project is no surprise to her.\n“He’s humanizing the badge and showing what we do and that we are people behind this badge,” DiPaola said. “If he can touch even one person, which I think he has touched a lot more than just one, yes, he is getting results.”\nThe Trust The badge Podcast can be found on Apple Podcasts, Spotify and YouTube.\nCopyright 2024 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.",
