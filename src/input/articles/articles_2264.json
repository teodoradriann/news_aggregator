Written by Arun Janardhanan Chennai | June 2, 2024 02:49 IST Follow Us PM Narendra Modi at the Thiruvalluvar statue, Saturday. (Image source: PTI) Prime Minister Narendra Modi, clad in white, emerged from his 45-hour-long meditation at the Vivekananda Rock Memorial on Saturday. His spiritual sojourn comes against the backdrop of the final phase of the Lok Sabha elections.\nThe Prime Minister’s meditation session began on the evening of May 30, in the Dhyan Mandapam, where the revered Swami Vivekananda is believed to have had a divine vision of Bharat Mata.\nThe rock memorial, set against the backdrop of Kanyakumari’s famed sunrise and sunset vistas, sits on a tiny islet where the Eastern and Western coastlines of India meet, and where the Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal, and Arabian Sea converge. At dawn, Modi performed the Surya Arghya, a ritual involving the offering of water to the sun, symbolising reverence and gratitude. Clad in saffron, he poured water from a traditional, small beaker-like vessel into the sea, chanting prayers.\nAdvertisement Also Read | PM Modi in Kanyakumari: Can a meditation break work for you? After completing his meditation, Modi paid floral tributes to the 133-foot statue of Thiruvalluvar, a towering figure in Tamil literature, which stands adjacent to the rock memorial. Arriving at the statue complex by ferry, he placed a garland at the poet’s feet.\nAfter completing his meditation, Modi returned to the mainland by ferry and took the helicopter to Thiruvananthapuram before taking an aircraft to Delhi around 4 pm. On completing his meditation, he wrote, “Visiting the Vivekananda Rock Memorial at Kanyakumari, the southernmost tip of India, I feel a divine energy. It is on this rock that Mother Parvati and Swami Vivekananda had meditated. Later, Eknath Ranade transformed this rock into a ‘Shila Smarak’ that brought Swami Vivekananda’s thoughts to life. Swami Vivekananda, a leader of spiritual renaissance, has been my ideal, my energy, and the source of my spirituality.”\n“My meditation at this ‘Shila Smarak’ is one of the unforgettable moments of my life. Sitting at the feet of ‘Ma Bharati’, I once again reaffirm my resolve that every moment of my life and every particle of my body will always be dedicated to the service of the nation,” he wrote. “With wishes for the progress of the nation and the welfare of its citizens, I offer my utmost reverence to ‘Ma Bharati’.”\nPM Shri @narendramodi performed 'Dhyana' at the Swami Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanniyakumari, Tamil Nadu . pic.twitter.com/Y2aWgv1tW8\n— BJP (@BJP4India) June 1, 2024\nThe visit mirrors Modi’s pattern of embarking on spiritual journeys at the end of significant political campaigns. In 2019, he visited Kedarnath, a sacred Hindu pilgrimage site in the Himalayas. In 2014, following his electoral victory, he travelled to Shivaji’s Pratapgarh fort.\nAdvertisement A BJP statement ahead of his journey to Kanyakumari spoke about mythological links of the rock, where Goddess Parvati is believed to have meditated on one foot, awaiting her union with Lord Shiva. The Rock Memorial was built in 1970 to commemorate visit of Swami Vivekananda, who meditated here before his journey to the West.\nClick here for real-time updates on the Lok Sabha 2024 Exit Poll results\n© The Indian Express Pvt Ltd First uploaded on: 02-06-2024 at 02:49 IST Tags: Narendra Modi Latest Comment Post Comment Read Comments Advertisement KCET 2024 Results declared at cetonline.karnataka.gov.in Education Updated: June 1, 2024 18:26 IST The Karnataka Examination Authority has declared the KCET results on June 1.

    "text": "The\nMunicipality of Oradea in Romania illustrates perfectly that smaller cities can play a significant role in promoting sustainability and climate action.\nAn important social, economic, and cultural centre in Romania’s North-West, Bihor County’s capital and a growing city, Oradea set clear objectives to improve the quality of life for its residents and to become a model for sustainable urban development. And over the years, the Municipality has accomplished them and set new ones. The Municipality’s journey has been in partnership with the European Investment Bank, working together for the last 15 years. Here’s how a relatively small city made big strides towards a better life for its citizens.\n“It has been very rewarding to witness the progress the municipality has made,” says Patricia Llopis, a senior urban specialist at the European Investment Bank who works with Oradea. “They prove time and time again that being a smaller municipality is not a disadvantage. They built their capacity over time, their knowledge and understanding, investing in ever greener projects, matching the EIB’s green ambitions, while having a major impact on citizens’ lives and delivering positive results.”\n- Read about\n[renovation of the University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science, and Technology in Târgu Mureş in Romania](/en/stories/romania-university-renovation)\nOredea and the EIB\nSince 2008, the Municipality of Oradea has signed six contracts with the\nEuropean Investment Bank for a total of [€115 million](/en/press/all/2023-235-eib-group-and-romania-marking-30-years-of-partnership-with-eur675-million-in-new-financing), part of an investment programme of around €380 million, co-financed with EU structural funds These loans have made it possible for the municipality to – inter alia - upgrade public transport and improve road safety as well as rehabilitate the city hall and a number of other important public buildings. The EIB financing also supported the expansion of the emergency unit at the local hospital; energy efficiency improvements to public street lighting, schools and hospitals; the construction of student dormitories, the exploitation of underground water for geothermal water heat, and the laying out of new public parks.\nMost recently, EIB and Oradea Municipality signed a loan for EUR 20.9m in June 2023 toward financing smart public lighting, the modernisation of the city’s central park and the greening of public transport. Oradea can be a source of inspiration for other medium-sized municipalities across Europe. Over the years Oradea has worked with the EIB on 123 projects, step-by-step and project-by-project delivering a positive impact on the quality of life of its citizens, on the environment and on climate.\n“By combining grants from the EU structural funds with EIB loans, Oradea Municipality has managed to implement a number of impactful investments faster and at a larger scale than would have been possible with EU grants alone.” says Snezhina Kovacheva, the loan officer from the European Investment Bank who works on the project. “Oradea Municipality exemplifies the type of impact that can be achieved when a compelling political vision is combined with implementation capacity at the local level.”\nImprove public buildings and green open spaces\nThe need for more open, green and recreational spaces for the city’s residents led the municipality to develop the Oradea Green City Programme.\nThis strategic planning document outlines the priorities “for the development of green urban public space and the increase in the standard of living of the municipality’s citizens,” says Florin Birta, Mayor of Oradea.\nUnder the Green City Programme, 91.3% of the population will have access to a public green urban space within a five-minute walk from their home by 2030 and green space per inhabitant will rise from 23 square meters per inhabitant to 29.4 square metres, an excellent level by European standards.\nImproving energy efficiency in public buildings and spaces\nInvestment in smart public lighting—with LED lighting and motion sensors— aims to improve the urban safety of Oradea’s citizens, making sure that every pedestrian street and road is well-lit, particularly in winter.\nThe municipality is also developing a new management system to control and reduce its energy costs. The new system identifies faults and reduce repair times.\n“We want Oradea to be a dynamic city, where the municipality is a key player in active development by creating the right conditions for that development, through the necessary public investments,” says Mayor Birta.\nContinue to develop public transport\nEach day, Oradea Municipality’s local public transport network carries people on 175 000 trips, mostly on the tram and the bus. A modern and efficient public transport fleet attracts more users and has a smaller carbon footprint that a more dated fleet would, reducing environmental pollution and contributing to climate action.\nThe municipality intends to develop its public transport infrastructure further, develop new means of public transport and link different types of public transport together as well as expand pedestrian areas and cycling routes.\nThe modernisation of the city’s streets gives public transport priority over private vehicles.\n- Read about\n[Romanian transport infrastructure](/en/stories/romanian-transport-infrastructure-roller-coaster-ride)",

    "title": "Dani Carvajal acelera su regreso: quiere estar en el Mundial de Clubes",
    "text": "Dani Carvajal está en modo bestia. Cinco meses después de su grave lesión en la rodilla, el lateral del Real Madrid ya pisa el césped de Valdebebas y se marca un objetivo claro: estar listo para el Mundial de Clubes en junio. Su recuperación va viento en popa y su motivación está por las nubes.\nUna lesión que hizo temer lo peor\nEl 5 de octubre de 2024, en un partido contra el Villarreal, Carvajal sufrió una de las lesiones más complicadas de su carrera: rotura del ligamento cruzado anterior, colateral externo y el tendón poplíteo. Un combo terrible que lo obligó a pasar por el quirófano y empezar una recuperación durísima.\nA pesar del golpe, el madrileño nunca bajó los brazos. Desde el primer momento, su mentalidad fue clara: trabajar sin descanso para volver lo antes posible. Ahora, tras meses de rehabilitación, ya entrena con balón y pisa el césped, acercándose cada vez más a su regreso.\nUn regreso con fecha en la mira\nEl objetivo de Carvajal es claro: volver en junio para disputar el Mundial de Clubes en Estados Unidos. Su evolución ha sido tan buena que los médicos han tenido que pedirle que frene un poco: \"Le hemos tenido que parar\", dicen desde Valdebebas. Pero él sigue con el acelerador a fondo.\nAdemás, el Real Madrid lo espera con los brazos abiertos. La banda derecha ha sufrido sin él, y aunque Lucas Vázquez ha hecho lo que ha podido, su regreso es clave para reforzar al equipo de cara a la próxima temporada.\nCarvajal, más motivado que nunca\nEn una reciente entrevista, el lateral dejó claro su estado de ánimo: \"Estoy como un animal. Voy muy bien, avanzando día a día en plazos excelentes y sin contratiempos.\" Además, aunque reconoce que extraña jugar, ha aprovechado la lesión para pasar más tiempo con su familia.\nCon su vuelta cada vez más cerca, el madridismo ya sueña con ver de nuevo a uno de sus capitanes en acción. Y si algo ha demostrado Carvajal en toda su carrera, es que siempre vuelve más fuerte.",

    "text": "Sam Taylor-Johnson and her husband Aaron have had an incredible time in the Caribbean, with Sam sharing very rare snaps of herself with her hubby after their relaxing stay. Posting a series of photos to Instagram, including snaps of the pair dancing on the beach, delicious cuisine, and spending time with their friends in Jamaica, the 56-year-old captioned the post: \"2024. Feeling the feelings,\" accompanied by hearts and Jamaica flag emojis. Fans were quick to comment, with one writing: \"Holy moly, that looks like an awesome time. I'd have just laid down taking in the vibe,\" while another person added: \"This is too perfect!! Fomo.\" The trip comes while the Internet is rife with reports that Aaron is set to become the new James Bond. After being quizzed about the gig back in August 2023, he told Esquire: \"What comes from [Kraven] could generate many different conversations… But this is the thing, right? As I’ve already told you, I have to go by the beat of my own drum. It’s my own path, what feels intuitive to me. \"I’ve never made a decision based on other people’s perspectives, or their judgments, or their expectations. You lose your [expletive] mind if you do that. Your sense of worth and soul is gone. You need to understand what is integral to you and what feels right, and you’ve got to stay on track with what’s present in front of you. Kraven is what’s in front of me. I’ve spent two years making Kraven. So all that hard work we put into trying to get that to where it is – that’s where I’m at right now.\" Sam and Aaron have been married since 2012, having met on the set on Nowhere Boy, and now share two daughters. Speaking about meeting her for the audition, Aaron told Harper’s Bazaar: \"I remember it very, very clearly. I know exactly what she was wearing. This white shirt that she still has, that I love. It definitely changed my life, though not in the way I expected.\" Addressing their 23-year age gap, he told The Telegraph: \"When I met Sam I'd already lived a life far beyond that of most of my contemporaries – I didn't relate to anyone my age. I just feel that we're on the same wavelength.\" Sam told The Sunday Times: \"We spend every minute of the day together. My friends call him Benjamin Button because he has — on the outside — such youth, and on the inside, he is so wise and settled. He doesn't like parties. He likes being at home and cooking for the family. He likes walking the dogs. He loves his chickens — he collects the eggs and makes breakfast for everyone.\"",

    "text": "In times of war and peace, the role of our Allies has proven essential in preserving the basis for a stable, free and prosperous world. During World War II, cooperation between the Allied nations was critical in defeating the forces of tyranny and ending the deadliest military conflict in human history.\nAs we draw near the 79th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, it’s a poignant moment to reflect on the immense sacrifices our Allies made alongside us in the defeat of Nazi Germany and the jubilant worldwide celebrations that followed with the triumph of liberty. In today’s turbulent global landscape, I remain optimistic that Americans and our global counterparts will remember the remarkable achievements born of unity in our pursuit of peace and freedom.\nAs the child of a World War II veteran, I hold a profound gratitude for my father’s selfless service, a sentiment shared by countless others whose families were touched by that era. Like the 16 million who served, my father embodied the resilience and values of the Greatest Generation. Another figure who left an indelible mark on that time was F. Haydn Williams, a lifelong friend of my parents. His honorable service throughout WWII is a testament to his dedication.\nIn 1993, Williams took the helm of the American Battle Monuments Commission’s National World War II Memorial Site and Design Committee, leading with unwavering commitment. His pivotal role in shaping the memorial’s vision and execution earned him the well-deserved title of the “Father of the World War II Memorial.”\nThe National World War II Memorial in Washington honors the 16 million who served in the U.S. armed forces during World War II, the more than 400,000 who died, and the millions who supported the war effort from home.\nSymbolic of the defining event of the 20th century, the memorial is a monument to the spirit, sacrifice and commitment of the American people to the common defense of the nation and the broader causes of peace and freedom from tyranny throughout the world. It inspires future generations, deepening their appreciation of what the World War II generation accomplished in securing freedom and democracy.\nAs with any public structure, the memorial needs continual repair and maintenance. It is only one of many memorials for which the National Park Service is responsible. It is the mission of Friends of the National World War II Memorial to focus solely on this memorial, its needs and the educational programming opportunities associated with it.\nAs such, Congress passed a law authorizing the U.S. Treasury to mint coins commemorating the memorial. Proceeds from the sale of the commemorative coins will go to the Friends of the National World War II Memorial to be used to maintain and repair the memorial and for educational and commemorative programming.\nThe Greatest Generation was the last to fight in a world war. With less than 120,000 of these treasured heroes still with us, let’s take a moment to honor those who fought across Europe and all who served.\nJane Droppa is the chair of the Friends of the National World War II Memorial in Washington/InsideSources",
