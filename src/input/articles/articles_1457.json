    "title": "¿Qué sabemos del nuevo misil hipersónico ruso Oréshnik?",
    "text": "Moscú (EFE).- El nuevo misil balístico ruso Oréshnik (Avellano) con el que Rusia atacó el jueves territorio ucraniano es uno de los últimos ejemplos del armamento hipersónico de nueva generación desarrollado por la industria militar rusa.\nNi las autoridades ni la prensa había informado nunca antes sobre la existencia del Oréshnik, capaz de burlar cualquier escudo antimisiles occidental, según el presidente ruso, Vladímir Putin.\nEn su mensaje a la nación, Putin destacó que la velocidad que alcanza el nuevo misil es de “Mach 10” o “2,5-3 kilómetros por segundo”, lo que le convierte en indetectable para las defensas antiaéreas enemigas.\nEl Oréshnik El Oréshnik forma parte de los sistemas de armamento “sin parangón en el mundo” presentados en sociedad por Putin en 2018, en lo que muchos llamaron la nueva Guerra de las Galaxias entre Rusia y la OTAN .\nLos expertos rusos, que recuerdan que el Oréshnik puede portar ojivas nucleares, apuntan que el misil tiene un mínimo de seis cabezas de guiado individual.\nPutin confirma el ataque a Ucrania con un misil balístico hipersónico sin carga nuclear Un misil de alcance medio El misil, de alcance medio, podría teóricamente golpear objetivos situados a incluso miles de kilómetros de distancia con un margen de error de apenas unas pocas decenas de metros.\nPutin justificó el lanzamiento “de prueba” -como lo definió-, aduciendo que Estados Unidos planea el despliegue de misiles de corto y medio alcance en territorio de Europa y la región de Asia Pacífico.\nRecordó que Estados Unidos cometió un error cuando decidió abandonar de manera unilateral en 2019 el tratado para la eliminación de misiles de corto y medio alcance.\nAdemás, advirtió que “en caso de escalada” Rusia responderá de manera “firme” y “simétrica”, y acusó a EE.UU. de destruir el sistema internacional de seguridad y de conducir al mundo a un “conflicto global” al intentar por todos los medios mantener su hegemonía.",

    "title": "Heavy rainfall had less-than-anticipated impact on Long Hill",
    "text": "LONG HILL TWP. - Township neighborhoods received three inches of rain on Tuesday, Jan. 9, but there is good news. “The storm had less impact to our area than anticipated,” said Office of Emergency Management (OEM) Coordinator Joseph Hubert on Wednesday, Jan. 10. While the rain caused less damage than expected, another smaller storm was forecasted for Friday night, Jan. 12. It was predicted that Long Hill would receive another one to two inches of rain, and that the Passaic River will crest at about 8.2 feet. “The storm is much smaller, but obviously the river is quite high already,” Hubert said on Jan. 12. “I expect the river to rise again on Saturday (Jan. 13).” It appeared that the Jan. 12 rainfall had minimal impact on Long Hill. Gov. Phil Murphy issued an executive order declaring a state of emergency due to the rainstorm, effective at 5 p.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 9. Weather projections for Long Hill had claimed that the rain would be heaviest from 6 p.m. on Jan. 9 to 1 a.m. on Jan. 10, that rainfall totals could be anywhere from two to four inches, and that there would be wind gusts of up to 45 mph. Hubert had predicted that the Passaic River would crest on Wednesday morning, Jan. 10, rising to 8.1 feet. “As always with significant weather events, we are closely monitoring this storm in collaboration with local, county and state officials,” said Mayor Guy Piserchia on Jan. 9. “I had several conversations yesterday with the governor’s office, and participated in an update call with over 100 mayors from five counties.” Long Hill schools had a two-hour delayed opening on Wednesday, Jan. 10 due to the rain storm. Central Middle School began at 10:15 a.m., and Gillette and Millington schools started at 11 a.m. As of Thursday night, Jan. 11, Hilltop Road between Semerad Road and Overlook Road in Millington was fully reopened, after a large tree fell across the road with power lines down. The following roads are still impacted by flooding, as of Monday afternoon, Jan. 15: • Whitebridge Road, the west-end leading into Lord Stirling Road, is closed and impassable; • Morristown Road, between Madison Road and Lombardo Farms, is closed but passable with some issues; • Warren Avenue, the south-end near Jaeger Lumber, is closed but passable with some issues. \"Overnight or latest tomorrow we will see these roads re-open,\" Hubert said on Jan. 15. Hubert also warned residents to be careful on Monday night, Jan. 15, as there is a winter storm moving through the area. The National Weather Service issued a winter weather advisory notice, in effect from 7 p.m. on Jan. 15 to 4 p.m. on Jan. 16. It predicts that portions of central, northern and northwest New Jersey will receive about two to four inches of snow and ice accumulations. Piserchia stated on Jan. 9 that Hubert is working closely with the Morris County Office of Emergency Management, the Long Hill Police Department and the Long Hill Department of Public Works. “I am confident everything that can be done is being done,” Piserchia said.

    "text": "01/02/2024 - 16:38\nOs Estados Unidos impuseram sanções, nesta quinta-feira (1º), a um grupo de colonos judeus acusados de violência contra civis palestinos na Cisjordânia, em uma medida rara contra israelenses em meio à guerra com o grupo islamista palestino Hamas, informaram fontes oficiais americanas.\nA violência dos colonos judeus alcançou “níveis intoleráveis”, escreveu o presidente americano, Joe Biden, em sua ordem executiva.\nA decisão é destinada a punir pessoas acusadas de ataques, de “atos de terrorismo” ou que “prejudiquem a paz, a estabilidade e a segurança” no território.\nOs Estados Unidos anunciaram sanções iniciais contra quatro pessoas, entre elas David Chai Chasdai, da localidade de Huwara, que é acusado de distúrbios que provocaram a morte de um civil palestino.\nOutro dos sancionados foi Yinon Levi, acusado de liderar um grupo de colonos que atacaram civis palestinos e beduínos, queimando seus campos e destruindo suas propriedades.\nO governo de Israel rechaçou essas sanções, ao considerar que “não há espaço para medidas excepcionais” contra os colonos israelenses na Cisjordânia ocupada.\n“A absoluta maioria de colonos da Judeia e Samaria (Cisjordânia) são cidadãos que respeitam a lei, e muitos combatem atualmente na defesa de Israel. Israel atua contra todos os que violam a lei em todas as partes”, afirmou em um comunicado o gabinete do primeiro-ministro israelense, Benjamin Netanyahu.\nTodos os ativos que tiverem nos Estados Unidos serão bloqueados, e os americanos serão proibidos de realizar transações financeiras com essas pessoas.\nEssas são as primeiras sanções financeiras contra colonos, embora o governo Biden tenha anunciado anteriormente que negaria vistos a extremistas envolvidos em atos de violência.\nA medida foi anunciada no dia em que Biden viaja para Michigan, um estado crucial na eleição presidencial de novembro e lar de uma importante comunidade árabe-americana, onde cresceu o descontentamento pelo apoio de Biden a Israel.\nAo explicar as novas ações, um funcionário de alto escalão do governo americano disse que Biden tem colocado, sistematicamente, para Israel, sua preocupação em relação à violência dos colonos.\n“Essas ações representam uma séria ameaça à paz, à segurança e à estabilidade na Cisjordânia, em Israel e na região do Oriente Médio”, disse a mesma fonte, que pediu para não ser identificada.\n“Também obstruem a realização, em última análise, de um Estado palestino independente que coexista com o Estado de Israel e, por extensão, de uma paz e estabilidade duradouras tanto para os palestinos quanto para os israelenses”, acrescentou.\nColonos israelenses mataram pelo menos dez palestinos e queimaram dezenas de casas na Cisjordânia ocupada em 2023, tornando o referido ano “mais violento” já registrado para ataques de colonos, segundo o grupo de direitos humanos Yesh Din.\nCerca de 490.000 colonos vivem entre cerca de três milhões de palestinos na Cisjordânia, em assentamentos considerados ilegais segundo o direito internacional.\nsct/bgs/db/atm/aa/tt/dd/mvv",

    "text": "FILE PHOTO: A view of the Supreme Court of Pakistan building during sunset hours in Islamabad, Pakistan October 3, 2023. REUTERS/Akhtar Soomro/File photo\nISLAMABAD (Reuters) – Hundreds of supporters from Pakistani Islamist parties on Friday rallied to protest against what they say were blasphemous remarks by the country’s chief justice.\nThe protest call, by various religious and political groups led by hardline Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) whose rallying cry is “death to blasphemers”, said that remarks by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa in a case against a member of the minority Ahmadi community were blasphemous.\nThe court had granted bail to an Ahmadi community member earlier this week, ruling that blasphemy charges against him did not stand. The man, accused of blasphemy for distributing Islamic literature, had been in jail for 13 months.\n“We (will) monitor the sermons and protests outside mosques,” said police official Abrar Hussain in southern city of Karahci, warning the protesters to remain peaceful.\nHundreds of the protesters took to streets in the northwestern city of Peshawar, chanting slogans against the chief justice, said police official Mubarak Khan.\nThe top court on Thursday issued a statement after the Islamist parties and some political groups launched a campaign accusing the chief justice of deviating in his ruling from the constitutional definition of a Muslim, which excludes Ahmadis.\n“This impression is absolutely wrong,” the court statement said, deploring what it called a “vicious campaign” against Isa.\nThe campaign against Isa was also joined by some supporters and aides of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who think a ruling by the chief justice stripping Khan’s party of its symbol on ballots cost them votes in an election on Feb. 8.\nKhan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party’s information secretary Rauf Hasan did not respond to a request for a comment.\nHuman rights groups say Pakistan’s harsh blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal scores, and just accusing someone of such a crime could lead to mob justice.\nJudges hesitate to take up such cases for fear of retribution, which leaves accused languishing in jail for years without cases being heard.\nBlasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan. No one has been executed by the state for it, but numerous accused have been lynched by outraged mobs.\n(Reporting by Asif Shahzad in Islamabad, Ariba Shahid in Karachi and Mushtaq Ali in Peshawar; Editing by Peter Graff)",

    "title": "March for Fair Seniors’ Pensions set for March 21 in White Rock - Vernon Morning Star",
    "text": "A White Rock woman who wants to draw attention to seniors’ poverty is organizing a local event to highlight the issue – and she’s hoping plenty will turn out to support the cause. The Seniors Tin Cup March for Fair Seniors’ Pensions will take place Thursday, March 21 on the Semiahmoo Peninsula and at several locations across British Columbia, including Kamloops, Ladysmith, Prince George, Terrace and Vernon. White Rock organizer Sue Reid, a senior herself, used to live in Chilliwack before moving to the seaside city, and heard – through word of mouth – that there were approximately 50 homeless seniors living in their vehicles and about 15 seniors in the same situation in White Rock. “There’s a lot of that going on. We did run into one woman uptown (White Rock) who is a senior living on the streets,” Reid said. “It’s just been something my partner and I have talked about, because we just keep hearing more and more and more about seniors not having enough money to stretch… they’re only making just over $17,000 a year?” The average rent for a one-bedroom can be nearly $2,200, she noted, citing a recent news story that quoted the record-high rate. “Let’s face it – there’s some falling between the cracks.” READ ALSO: [South Surrey’s Brella to share in $809K from province](https://www.peacearchnews.com/news/south-surreys-brella-to-share-in-809k-from-province-2880520) Reid said seniors who rely on the Canadian Pension Plan, Old Age Security and Guaranteed Income Supplement are receiving less than $18,000 to $20,000, but the Canadian poverty threshold is $25,252 a year. “I’ve never done anything like this, but I figure I just can’t sit around complaining and not do something,” Reid said of the march. “We need to bring attention to what’s happening to our seniors – they’re falling through the cracks here. (Government) needs to increase their pension and bring it up to the poverty level so these people can at least live with some dignity.” People can work hard their whole lives and not have enough money for retirement for a number of reasons and often, women are affected more than men, Reid noted, especially women who may have worked hard taking care of the home and children, while not necessarily earning an income for that work. A Seniors Tin Cup pamphlet notes that single parenthood, divorce, employers who don’t offer pension plans, the death of a spouse or child, accident or injury, investment losses, addiction, mental illness are among the many reasons seniors may have to rely on CPP, GIS and OAS. “If the average rent is $2,200 a month and they get $1,700 a month, they’re in a deficit already. How can they do it?” Reid questioned. If people want to help draw attention to senior’s poverty, they’re more than welcome to join in the march, she emphasized. “Anybody that wants to support is welcome.” The March for Fair Seniors’ Pensions happens from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Thursday, March 21. In White Rock, participants will muster at 10:30 a.m. at South Surrey-White Rock Kerry-Lynne Findlay’s office in Windsor Square, 1959 152 St. Visit seniorstincup.org for more details.",
