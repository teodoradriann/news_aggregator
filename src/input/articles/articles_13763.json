    "text": "© Reuters. Australian real estate prices defy the odds, rising again in February The nation’s love affair with real estate shows no signs of waning. Australian home values rose yet again in February, defying the countervailing economic pressures of higher interest rates, inflation and the rising cost of living.\nAll capital cities saw growth\nCoreLogic's latest Home Value Index tells us there was a 0.6% increase across the nation, with all capital cities except Hobart experiencing growth in property values.\nThis resurgence in home values marks a significant rebound from the slowdown observed towards the end of the previous year.\nCoreLogic's head of research, Eliza Owen, highlighted the unusual nature of the property market's strength amidst weak economic conditions.\n\"It's pretty unusual for economic conditions to be so weak but the housing market showing this really strong trend,\" Owen said of the February re-acceleration.\nDespite facing 13 consecutive interest rate rises since May 2022, the property market has shown resilience, spurred by optimism over potential rate cuts later in the year and positive inflation news.\nThe limited supply of dwellings in comparison to the demand is a major driver behind the price growth, with factors such as high levels of net overseas migration and delays in new construction due to industry constraints playing significant roles.\nIn Melbourne, the property market is notably vibrant, with real estate agents noting an increase in buyer interest ahead of anticipated rate cuts.\nDespite the current upward trend, there are several factors that could yet limit growth, including a softening economy, potential delays in rate cuts and rising unemployment.\nRate reduction will help\nInvestors are still lured, however, by the possibility of a cash rate reduction towards the end of 2024, which would boost to housing market yet again by making it accessible to first-time home buyers looking to enter the market.\nThe next meeting of the Reserve Bank is scheduled for March 18-19, with most economists not expecting a rate cut until the latter half of the year.\nThe interplay of buyer optimism, supply constraints, and economic challenges continues to shape the Australian housing market's trajectory, presenting a complex landscape for both buyers and sellers.\nRead more on Proactive Investors AU\nDisclaimer\nAustralian real estate prices defy the odds, rising again in February",

    "text": "A buyer has paid €1.932 millon (around £1.69m) for one of Napoleon’s trademark bicorne hats. The sale, in Paris on Sunday, makes the headgear, with its distinctive cockade of ribbons, the most valuable Napoleon hat ever sold. The two-pointed hats worn by France’s first Emperor were a well-known visual marker even during his life. Napoleon wore the hats sideways, against the prevailing fashion. He is believed to have owned 120 of them during his life. The most valuable hat before this week’s sale was sold in 2014 for nearly €1.9 m. That hat had been worn at the the Battle of Marengo in 1800. That was one of Napoleon’s most famous military triumphs. This hat has a less glorious history, and was worn by Napoleon as he returned from exile in Elba, on his way to his final defeat at Waterloo. The hat was the star item in the sale of the collection of French tycoon Col Pierre Baillon who died in 2022. It had been in the family of Napoleon’s quarter master Jean-Louis Noisiez for much of its history. The distinctive tricolore ribbons also tied it to the emperor. Just 20 of Napoleon’s hats are believed to survive, only 5 of them in private hands. Sales are rare. The auction was a rich hunting ground for Napoleon enthusiasts. It also included a nightshirt, a vanity case, and a plate nabbed from his carriage after Waterloo. The release of a new Napoleon biopic means interest in the Corsican-born leader is especially high. Napoleon rose from relatively humble origins in a newly conquered French province to head an Empire that controlled much of Western Europe. His skills as a military tactician are universally acknowledged. His political legacy is still disputed. The emperor’s sword sold for £3 million in 2007. The engagement ring he gave to Josephine (his wife, who plays an enormous role in his legend) sold for nearly $1 million in 2013. Both would undoubtedly make much more if sold today.

    "title": "Russie : Menacée par le pouvoir, l’activiste Maria Andreïeva cesse sa lutte pour les soldats russes",
    "text": "Après avoir été déclarée « agente de l’étranger » par les autorités et avoir perdu son travail, Maria Andreïeva jette l’éponge. La meneuse de manifestations de femmes de soldats russes mobilisés en Ukraine en faveur de leur retour chez eux a annoncé mardi arrêter son combat. La répression croissante ayant rendu les manifestations rarissimes en Russie, les associations de femmes ou de proches de mobilisés étaient jusqu’à récemment les seules à encore organiser des rassemblements à Moscou, appelant Vladimir Poutine à renvoyer chez eux les hommes envoyés au front depuis plus de deux ans. « Privée de moyens de subsistance » « Hélas, je dois retourner dans l’ombre », a déclaré Maria Andreïeva, la figure de proue du mouvement « Retour à la maison ». Cette activiste avait été labellisée début mai « agente de l’étranger », une formule infamante qui implique de lourdes contraintes administratives en Russie. Lundi, Maria Andreïeva, qui travaillait dans un centre spécialisé en psychoneurologie infantile dans la capitale russe, avait annoncé qu’elle avait dû quitter son emploi en raison de son nouveau statut qui l’empêche de travailler dans un établissement public. « Les agents de l’étranger ne sont pas seulement privés de leurs droits, ils sont privés de leurs moyens de subsistance ! », avait-elle fustigé sur Telegram. Arrestations de manifestants et de journalistes Jusqu’au début de cette année, via la chaîne Telegram intitulée « Retour à la maison », les femmes de soldats appelaient à manifester quasiment chaque semaine, sur la tombe du Soldat inconnu, au pied des murs du Kremlin. Ces rassemblements se sont raréfiés après une série d’arrestations, en particulier de journalistes, le 24 février, à l’occasion du deuxième anniversaire de l’assaut russe contre l’Ukraine. La police avait alors incité les médias, dont l’AFP, à éviter ces rassemblements. Depuis le début de l’offensive en Ukraine en février 2022, les voix dissidentes en Russie ont été poussées à l’exil ou bien sanctionnées, voire emprisonnées. La Russie a mobilisé 300.000 réservistes à l’automne 2022 pour regarnir les rangs de son armée, qui était alors en difficulté sur le front.",

We were really worried about him.\n‘He eventually ended up in Tallaght Hospital A&E on Stephen’s Day. A shout out to the Nurses we met who were so kind and caring to Oisín and us.

    "text": "A través del Programa Cívico Permanente que impulsa el Banco Industrial se realizó un acto especial para honrar a los atletas guatemaltecos Jean Pierre Brol y Adriana Ruano, medallistas en los Juegos Olímpicos de París 2024. Se trata de la edición XXXIII de los Juegos Olímpicos de verano celebrados en París 2024, donde Jean Pierre Brol obtuvo la primera medalla de bronce para Guatemala destacando en la prueba masculina de tiro con armas de caza en el foso olímpico en un histórico 30 de julio. Mientras que Adriana Ruano obtuvo la medalla de oro, al día siguiente el 31 de julio, quien a la vez estableció un nuevo récord olímpico en la prueba femenina de tiro con armas de caza en el foso olímpico. Esta es la primera vez en la historia que Guatemala gana una medalla de oro en unos Juegos Olímpicos y también la primera vez en que el himno nacional fue entonado en una premiación de las justas olímpicas junto a la bandera nacional. RECONOCIMIENTO Durante la ceremonia, el ingeniero Luis Lara, Gerente General y Director Corporativo de Banco Industrial, fue el encargado de entregar un reconocimiento especial a ambos atletas. Además, se le otorgó un diploma a toda la delegación que representó a Guatemala en las justas olímpicas en París 2024. Como parte del homenaje, Adriana Ruano tuvo el honor de izar la bandera nacional en la Plaza Cívica «Ramiro Castillo Love» del Centro Financiero del Banco Industrial en la zona 4 de la capital. “En Banco Industrial, reconocemos el talento guatemalteco como uno de los determinantes que impulsan el desarrollo de nuestro país. Son las personas brillantes, disciplinadas, que apuntan y lo intentan hasta acertar en el objetivo que logran impulsar a Guatemala y poner el nombre de nuestra nación en alto. Felicitamos a Jean Pierre Brol y Adriana Ruano porque sabemos que ellos representan a todas las personas soñadoras que buscan ir juntos, siempre hacia adelante”, comentó el ingeniero Luis Lara. El Programa Cívico Permanente fue fundado en 1984 por el primer presidente de Banco Industrial, ingeniero Ramiro Castillo Love (q.e.p.d.). Tiene como propósito fundamental fortalecer los valores cívicos de los guatemaltecos y reconocer el aporte constructivo de personas e instituciones que engrandecen al país con su esfuerzo. A la fecha, se han realizado 1,587 homenajes a guatemaltecos y entidades que, por sus méritos ejemplares en beneficio de la comunidad, han contribuido a enaltecer el nombre de Guatemala.",

Após MC Davi afirmar que o filho de Fábio Jr. apenas contribuiu com parte da melodia e estaria tentando levar crédito total pela canção, Fiuk publicou um longo vídeo nas redes sociais para dar sua versão dos fatos.\nVEJA TAMBÉM: Justiça bate o martelo em caso polêmico envolvendo Graciele Lacerda e família Camargo\nNo desabafo, o cantor afirmou que participou ativamente do processo criativo da música, inclusive sugerindo que o tema fosse focado em mães solteiras e até propondo o nome da faixa. “Quando eu cheguei, tinha um refrãozinho pronto mesmo, mas estava bem no começo. A música aconteceu com todo mundo junto lá”, declarou Fiuk, ressaltando que a criação é resultado de um trabalho coletivo e que o mérito deveria ser compartilhado.\nFiuk também aproveitou o momento para questionar a razão de ser alvo de críticas e insinuou que sua imagem como “playboy” e “filho de famoso” pode estar influenciando negativamente a percepção de algumas pessoas sobre sua contribuição na música. “Eu me pergunto, por que que eu incomodo tanto? Será que essas pessoas percebem que elas tão completamente tomadas pelo próprio ego?”, desabafou.\nO cantor destacou que, embora o sucesso da música devesse ser motivo de comemoração, a polêmica está sendo alimentada por orgulho e vaidade. Ele lamentou que, ao invés de celebrarem o sucesso da canção, os envolvidos estejam tentando deslegitimar a contribuição um do outro. “A energia de todo mundo que estava ali naquela sala fez parte da composição, independente de quem fez o quê”, concluiu Fiuk, apelando para que a situação seja resolvida de forma mais justa.\nA música “Mãe Solteira”, que já alcançou o topo do Spotify Brasil e de Portugal, continua gerando debates entre os artistas envolvidos e seus seguidores.
