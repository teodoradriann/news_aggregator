    "text": "Chamdhera (Haryana): Vishnu Dabad attributes his rise from poverty to a powerful local politician to an animal: the cow. The 30-year-old is one of many Gau Rakshaks, or cow protectors: activists who have taken Indian laws banning cattle slaughter and beef consumption into their own hands since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014 at the head of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Scores of cow protectors in recent years have been accused of using violence to carry out extra-judicial activities, often finding themselves at odds with law enforcement, even as many won acclaim for defending the Hindu faith. Now some of these operatives are transferring their clout into grassroots political power, where they are pursuing a hardline majoritarian agenda, according to interviews with more than 90 activist-vigilantes, as well as senior leaders of the BJP and other parties, government officials and political analysts. They described how cow vigilantism has become a finishing school for the young men who mobilise large groups against alleged cattle smugglers and used the resulting popularity to catapult into politics. Many are now campaigning and preparing for elections in 2024 that the BJP and allied right-wing parties are favoured to do well in. Forty-one of the cow protectors who spoke to Reuters have been elected to positions such as village chief, town council member or local legislator in the past six years, roles that can involve governing tens of thousands of people. Another 12 said they were lobbying their family members to seek local office. \"All of what you see: my success, my existence is only because cows have blessed me,\" said Dabad, who started a cow protection force in 2014 and was elected as village chief in 2016. He is now a full-time political campaigner in the northern state of Haryana for a party allied with the BJP and is keen to seek higher office. Ancient Hindu religious texts praise cows, who are regarded as deities, for their nurturing ability. But India's minority Muslims and Christians, as well as some Hindus, consume beef as part of their diet, generating some sectarian tensions. There is no publicly available official estimate on the number of cow activists nationwide, but activist leaders said they believe more than 300,000 Hindu men in the nation of 1.4 billion are directly involved with their groups. India's interior ministry, which oversees national law enforcement, did not return a request for comment on that figure or the role of cow activists. Reuters previously reported that some of them have stopped cow traders - many of them Muslim men - with deadly force, according to prosecutors, witnesses and the families of victims. Some states have enacted laws enabling cow vigilantes to patrol alongside police. While government data does not distinguish general violence from cow-related lynching, Human Rights Watch found that at least 44 people - 36 of them Muslims - were killed in cow-related violence between May 2015 and December 2018. The independent, New Delhi-based Documentation of the Oppressed database found 206 acts of cow-related violence involving 850 victims, mainly Muslims, between July 2014 and August 2022. The proximity of cow activists to power has raised concerns among many Muslims, who allege that some BJP members and their affiliates have engaged in anti-Islam hate speech and violence. Modi and the BJP have denied that religious discrimination exists in India. Cow protectors \"are very powerful men…and there is a climate of fear,\" said Jaan Mohammed, a Muslim man whose brother was one of the first victims of a cow-related lynching after Modi took power. \"I don't think this can ever change now.\" Legal proceedings are pending. Seventeen men accused of involvement in his brother's 2015 killing were released on bail, and another suspect later died. Police at the time of the slaying said the alleged perpetrators behaved as if they had a \"licence to kill.\" Modi has repeatedly criticized activists who engage in \"criminal\" violence, even as his party courts their support. Giriraj Singh, a BJP minister responsible for rural development, said his party welcomed anyone who wanted to \"genuinely serve the cows\". \"Anyone who saves mother cow must be respected and recognised,\" he told Reuters. Image of modern-day Hindu warriors Half of India's 36 states and union territories have partial or complete bans on cow slaughter - most of them governed by the BJP. But enforcement has often fallen into the hands of activists. By posting videos of their raids on alleged cow smugglers on social media, they have mobilised money, as well as thousands of Hindu men. Religious cow protection movements have a long history in India, but many activists, including Dabad, said they were emboldened by Modi's sweeping 2014 victory. Dabad recounted bloody fights between his activists – who he said are often armed with batons, stones, machetes, and sickles – and alleged Muslim smugglers. He described spreading beds of nails on the road to stop vehicles suspected of smuggling cows, as well as high-speed chases and brutal attacks. \"The journey to protect cows has not been easy,\" said Dabad, who previously spent more than a month in jail for his vigilante activities. The police responsible for the area around his hometown of Chamdhera said Dabad has been the subject of nine criminal complaints related to religious clashes and that he was arrested once for allegedly beating up a Muslim trader. Investigations continue on one complaint, while the other probes have been dismissed, they said. The image of lawlessness has not stopped politicians from seeking the support of such activists. Six officials from the party of Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala, who identified himself as Dabad's political patron, said the activist was an effective campaigner and a rising star. Influential right-wing organisations such as the ruling party-affiliated World Hindu Council have helped legitimise the activists by depicting them as modern-day warriors waging a war against cow slaughter. Council spokesman Vinod Bansal likened cow protectors, some of whom he said had been killed in clashes, to brave religious warriors. He added that achieving political fame was only a side-effect of the efforts of some activists. Christophe Jaffrelot, a professor of Indian politics at King's College London, said the Indian state cannot harass minorities openly but by allowing vigilantes to do so, it keeps majoritarian feelings satisfied. \"And now these private armies ... are being given a share in governance and power at the local level,\" he said, adding that they would continue their penetration of politics. During an interview in his guesthouse, as his aides smoked on a brass water pipe, Dabad looked at them and said: \"We can all kill or get killed to protect the cow.\" Force of their own Of the 41 vigilante-politicians, eight said they joined the BJP at its encouragement. Another eight, including Dabad, joined other regional parties because they said they had doubts about the BJP's commitment to cows and Hindu values. \"If police would effectively identify and apprehend the alleged violators of cow protection laws, then not a single Gau Rakshak will be needed,\" said Ram Charan Pande, a cow vigilante leader who serves as a village head in the northwestern state of Rajasthan. Narendra Raghuvanshi, a member of a regional nationalist party and a Gau Rakshak based in the central state of Madhya Pradesh said that politicians often approached cow protectors for their support: \"They know we can tilt the Hindu vote in their favour\". Some of the activists-turned-politicians have created power bases of their own. Dabad, the son of an illiterate farmer, now zips around Haryana in a convoy of four SUVs, while running a centre for injured and ill cows. He said his political clout help him secure licences and offices for business ventures such as an alcohol store, an eatery and a real estate company. \"I have been able to set all of these businesses because now people know me as a man committed to protect cows,\" he said. That has caused unease within India's opposition parties and the country's security establishment, according to interviews with three officials and one lawmaker. A top Indian interior ministry official who was interviewed on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak with media, said the cow vigilantes have managed to blend popularity with nous on local issues. \"Even politicians feel threatened by the enormous network of cow vigilantes,\" he said. \"They have become a force of their own.\"",

    "title": "Tim Walz Pro-Abortion Stance Is Almost Too Much for Nancy Pelosi",
    "text": "Democrat vice presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) boasted about his pro-choice stance, saying that he is so pro-abortion that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) had to tell him to “tone it down.” Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate flaunted his radical policies, which are almost too progressive even by his party's standards. “My record is so pro-choice Nancy Pelosi asked me if I should tone it down,” Walz said while speaking at a Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL) convention. “I stand with Planned Parenthood.” Gov. Tim Walz is so extreme on abortion that Nancy Pelosi once told him that he needs to “tone it down” & be more moderate.— Kristan Hawkins (@KristanHawkins) Don’t vote for the ticket that will allow babies to die up until the moment of birth, and in some cases, even after birth. [pic.twitter.com/FjtlEepfPg] [August 6, 2024] Walz has declared himself an ally of abortion rights by signing a law that enables “reproductive freedom” into Minnesota’s constitution. He signed legislation that codifies the “right” to abortion and other forms of reproductive healthcare. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, abortion laws have been left up to the states. 2024 could see at least [11 states](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/23/nx-s1-4977323/abortion-law-legal-florida-arizona-amendment) face abortion rights amendments, with several states, such as South Dakota, Florida, and Missouri, seeing abortion bans reversed if the ballot measures pass. For instance, in Missouri, supporters look to get a proposed amendment on the ballot that could potentially nullify the state’s near-total ban on abortion. And in Florida, voters will determine whether abortion can be allowed up until birth or keep its current six-week ban, which would need 60 percent approval to pass. The case for abortion could significantly impact the outcome of the election, as well as which party controls Congress. Recommended SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser warned that a Harris- Walz ticket would be the “most pro-abortion Democratic ticket yet.” “Walz is no moderate when it comes to abortion,” Dannenfelser said, pointing out that last year, the Democrat governor signed a bill into law that legalizes abortion up until birth. “Gov. Walz’s absolutist abortion policy puts Minnesota in the company of just a small handful of countries around the world, including North Korea and China. It is extreme, inhumane, and harmful to women and children who deserve so much better,” MCCL Co-Executive Director Cathy Blaeser said. A [KFF Health Tracking Poll](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-march-2024-abortion-in-the-2024-election-and-beyond) found that just one in 8 voters, or 12 percent, say that abortion is the most crucial issue in the 2024 election. Broken down by demographic, 22 percent of Democrat women say their vote will depend entirely on the candidate’s abortion policy, while women aged 18-49 said the same thing. The survey also found that 43 percent of Republicans believe abortion should be legal in the majority of cases. However, not many Republicans who want abortion to be legal would switch parties based just on one policy.",

    "text": "US 7,800-ton nuclear submarine bolsters attack with more torpedo tubes, advanced tech\nThe vessel can go to a maximum depth of 800+ ft and offers a speed of 25+ knots (28+ miles per hour).\nThe United States is set to commission its fast-attack nuclear-powered submarine built using the latest technology on April 5. The USS Iowa will be commissioned by the US Navy in Groton, Connecticut.\nThe Virginia-class submarine took six years in the making. It was named after the state of Iowa in June 2023 by former Iowa first-lady Christie Vilsack, the ship’s sponsor.\nThe USS Iowa, which has a displacement of 7,800 tons of water, will be the first fast-attack submarine specifically designed and built to provide the privacy and accommodations females require.\nQuiet movement, sensitive sonar\nThe SSN 797 submarine offers quiet movement, and it’s equipped with sensitive sonar to track other subs and warships.\nThe vessel has four torpedo tubes and two Virginia Payload Tubes (VPT), each capable of holding six vertical-launch Tomahawk missiles that can strike targets over 1,200 miles away.\nThe vessel has photonics masts carrying thermal imaging and low-light cameras; replacing the telescope. It’s equipped with a nuclear reactor, which powers the submarine for a 30+ year lifespan. Its pump jet propulsion allows the vessel to move more quietly.\nWith a length of 377 ft, the vessel can go to a maximum depth of 800+ ft and offers a speed of 25+ knots (28+ miles per hour).\n“The USS Iowa Commissioning Committee raised money for the last five or six years for this week’s events and to provide upgrades to the boat that aren’t a part of the building process,” said Tom Hudson, a U.S. Navy Veteran and an executive director of the USS Iowa Commissioning Committee.\n“For example: where the crew eats and where they watch movies and things like that. We’re getting them ice cream machines. We’re getting them movie projectors. We’re getting them gaming stations. So when they’re out to sea, and they’re gone for 90, 100, 200 days at a time, they can have increased and improved quality of life.”\nSeveral ships named for Iowa in US history\nThe USS Iowa submarine is the latest of several ships named for Iowa in the nation’s history.\nAn Iowa steamship was used to transport troops in the Civil War. The battleship USS Iowa BB-4 saw service in the Spanish-American War of 1898 and the USS Iowa BB-61, “The Gray Ghost,” served in World War II, Korea and in the 1980s through 1990 patrolling the Persian Gulf. The state of Iowa paid $3 million toward the BB-61’s preservation before it was opened for public tours in 2012. Visiting Iowans may tour “The Gray Ghost” for free by simply displaying an Iowa driver license or state identification.\nRECOMMENDED ARTICLES\nThe official crest of the new USS Iowa submarine (SSN-797) is designed to visually represent the ship throughout its lifecycle. It’s a key element to Iowa’s identity. Filled with symbolism representing the state of Iowa as well as the storied battleship BB61, SSN797’s crest is worth learning about.\nThe Shield features the Iowa state seal in the background bordered by teak decking, symbolizing the teak deck boards aboard USS Iowa (BB-61) with the text “USS IOWA” above and “SSN 797” below, which is encircled by gold cord with 47 silver stars. These silver stars represent the 47 sailors who tragically lost their lives during the Number Two 16-inch gun turret explosion on April 19, 1989. On top of this is the profile of the state of Iowa adorned with the colors of the Iowa state flag.\nABOUT THE EDITOR\nPrabhat Ranjan Mishra Prabhat, an alumnus of the Indian Institute of Mass Communication, is a tech and defense journalist.

    "text": "Esteban Paredes aconsejó a Fernando Zampedri previo a su debut por Chile\nEl máximo goleador del fútbol chileno tuvo palabras para el posible estreno del Toro en La Roja.\nChile tiene todo listo para enfrentar a Paraguay en un partido clave para seguir con vida en las Clasificatorias sudamericanas. La Roja visitará al combinado guaraní en un partido que, además, podría marcar el debut de Fernando Zampedri con la selección chilena.\nEl delantero histórico de Universidad Católica fue\nnominado por el entrenador Ricardo Gareca de cara a esta fecha doble de las Eliminatorias luego de recibir hace algunas semanas su carta de nacionalización, la cual lo acredita como ciudadano chileno.\nVer esta publicación en Instagram\nLos consejos de Esteban Paredes a Fernando Zampedri\nSi bien se espera que Fernando Zampedri sea suplente en Chile para el compromiso ante Paraguay, el Toro podría ingresar desde la banca. Por ello, Esteban Paredes anticipó el posible debut del pentagoleador del fútbol chileno con la camiseta de La Roja.\n“Él tiene la capacidad de aguantar bien el balón de espalda y puede dar un desahogo a los volantes o extremos. Tiene gol que es importante y nos hace falta mucho”, dijo el máximo anotador del fútbol chileno a Radio ADN.\nSin embargo, Esteban paredes advirtió que el centrodelantero en el esquema de Ricardo Gareca “queda muy solo, pero con que los nombres son importantes, la selección de nuestros procesos casi todos jugaban en Europa y en su mejor momento. Cambió mucho a la selección de hoy, que hay muchos en Argentina, en México. Alexis viene con poco fútbol, Arturo está en Chile”.\nVer esta publicación en Instagram\n¿Cuándo juega Paraguay vs Chile por las Clasificatorias?\nChile visitará a Paraguay este jueves 20 de marzo desde las 20:00 horas en el Estadio Defensores del Chaco de Asunción.\n¿Cuántos Mundiales ha jugado Chile?\n¿Cuántos Mundiales se ha perdido Chile?",

    "text": "(Gray News) - Public health officials are investigating two possible cases of bird flu in cats that consumed recalled raw milk.\nAccording to a news release from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, the two indoor-living cats consumed a raw milk product linked to a recall of raw milk and cream products from Raw Farm, LLC.\nAfter consumption, the cats reportedly showed symptoms of lack of appetite, fever and neurologic signs. The infected cats died after severe worsening of their illness and subsequently tested positive for Influenza A - a rare result in cats, officials say.\nThere have been no human cases of bird flu associated with exposure to these cats yet identified.\nWhile a confirmatory test is pending in these two cases, a nationwide H5 bird flu outbreak has seen other cats infected with the virus after consuming infected raw milk.\nHealth officials say cats may be exposed to H5 bird flu by consuming infected birds or other animals, being in environments contaminated with the virus, and consuming unpasteurized milk from infected cows.\nHealth officials encourage residents to avoid consuming raw milk and to not feed it to their pets, including frozen raw milk products.\nSymptoms of H5 bird flu infection in humans include eye redness or discharge, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, trouble breathing and fever.\nAnyone who has consumed these specific recalled raw milk products and is experiencing symptoms should immediately contact their health care provider or local health department.\nCopyright 2024 Gray Local Media, Inc.

    "text": "There’s nothing worse than being referred to as “vanilla” in the NFL. Just ask Pittsburgh Steelers offensive players.\nBut Mason Rudolph did just that when comparing Pittsburgh’s scout team defense to the Cincinnati Bengals starters.\nRudolph was asked if practicing against guys like T.J. Watt and Minkah Fitzpatrick benefited him during his years as a reserve.\n“Yeah, it’s a great group to work against,” Rudolph said in a Wednesday press conference . “You know, we employ so many sorts of pre-snap disguise that it makes you play every snap with a sort of keen sense of awareness of where the safeties are moving… where’s Minkah Fitzpatrick. That prepares you a lot for other teams, other looks.”\nThe Bengals’ defense wasn’t a concern for Rudolph as it was for him practicing against the Steelers.\n“And then when you get a team, Cincinnati was not using their disguise very well. When you get a team that’s maybe less, maybe more vanilla. You can take a breath and say, you know, I’ve seen harder looks at this in practice. So, one of the main benefits of playing here.”\nRudolph and Pickett both put up career numbers against Cincinnati’s 28th-ranked pass defense : Rudolph went 17-of-27 for 290 yards and two scores, and Pickett 24-of-33 for 278 yards. The offense would’ve had an even better outing the first time around if Diontae Johnson hadn’t dropped a touchdown and Jaylen Warren hadn’t fumbled in the red zone.\nMore Mason Rudolph Steelers preparing for Mason Rudolph to start vs. Chargers Steelers QB Mason Rudolph got rocked last season in Cleveland.

    "text": "The Detroit Red Wings share an arena with the NBA’s Pistons, who just broke the single-season league record for most consecutive losses.\nThe Red Wings aren’t close to matching that run of futility, however it’s been a rough December for them as well. They are 2-8-1 over their last 11 games, including a 6-3 road loss to the Minnesota Wild on Wednesday.\nDetroit will try to turn things around during a pair of home games before the calendar flips to 2024. The Nashville Predators will visit on Friday and the Boston Bruins will come to town on New Year’s Eve.\nThe Red Wings experienced a third-period collapse against the Wild. They tied the game on Alex DeBrincat’s power-play goal before then allowing four goals in less than 10 minutes.\nCoach Derek Lalonde saw it coming.\n“Just our inability to manage our game,” he said. “It’s unbelievable. We were fortunate to come out of the second at 2-1. They had six Grade A’s (chances) in the second and they were all off egregious turnovers. The difference in the third is the puck ended in the back of the net off of turnovers where it did not in the second.”\nDetroit had a 14-7-3 record before its slide began. The Red Wings now are in danger of dropping to the .500 mark with a regulation loss to the Predators.\n“This was not us over the first 25 games,” Lalonde said. “We worked off a forecheck and we were a simple, predictable team. Now, it’s just blue line turnovers, high offensive zone turnovers, it’s disappointing.”\nOne of the few bright spots has been the production of Patrick Kane, who signed with Detroit as a free agent early in the month. He carries a five-game point streak (five goals, four assists) and four-game goal streak into Friday’s contest.\nThe Predators have lost their last two games and three of their last four contests. The Carolina Hurricanes posted a 5-2 win in Nashville on Wednesday.\nAll of the Hurricanes’ goals came during the first two periods.\n“I think we were a little careless at times,” Nashville coach Andrew Brunette said. “I think it was an emotional game. I thought we were excited to play, maybe a little bit too rambunctious a few different times. We took some offensive zone penalties that probably we wouldn’t like to take.”\nCarolina scored three of its goals with the man advantage.\n“Special teams, we lost that battle (Wednesday), which is frustrating,” center Ryan O’Reilly said.\nO’Reilly notched his 14th goal of the season on Wednesday. He trails only Filip Forsberg (16) for the team lead in goals.\n“I thought we did a lot of good things,” O’Reilly said. “Obviously, we’ve got to find a way to put the puck in the net a little bit better. We had some chances. Like I said, myself, I’m better than the shots I was putting on net there. Getting those point-blank opportunities and not putting them in the back of the net, I’m better than that, for sure.”\nNashville and Detroit split its two-game series last season. This will be the first of two meetings this season. The rematch will be held in Nashville on March 23.\n–Field Level Media",
