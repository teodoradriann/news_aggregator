    "text": "Balanced Indiana women’s basketball shows impressive poise in road win over Nebraska [Michael Niziolek](/staff/12240910002/michael-niziolek/) Nebraska tried to stack the deck against [Indiana women’s basketball](https://iuhoosiers.com/sports/womens-basketball) on Sunday afternoon. The team had a season-high 9,000-plus fans in attendance as the program honored the 2014 Big Ten Championship team at halftime and retired All-American Jordan Hooper’s No. 35 jersey. Hooper was the conference player of the year that season. Indiana (13-1; 4-0 Big Ten) [took the hostile road environment in stride in a 91-69 win](/story/sports/college/iu/2024/01/07/how-indiana-womens-basketball-beat-nebraska-in-lincoln-sunday-big-ten-mackenzie-holmes/72099573007/) against a Cornhuskers team that had won 7 of 8 and was 3-0 in Big Ten play. More: [Early risers: How another hot start propels Indiana women's basketball to a Big Ten win](/story/sports/college/iu/2024/01/07/how-indiana-womens-basketball-beat-nebraska-in-lincoln-sunday-big-ten-mackenzie-holmes/72099573007/) The Hoosiers led for all of 56 seconds on Sunday as they won their 12th straight game (three shy of the program record). “By now we are used to the environment,” Indiana coach Teri Moren said. “We are used to people being in the stands because of being in Simon-Scott (Assembly Hall) and playing in front of 8,000, 9,000, 10,000 a night. We are used to the energy in the building even though there were not many Hoosiers in here today.” Indiana women’s basketball took control right ‘from the jump’ They were locked in from the start with Sydney Parrish setting the tone for a second straight game from 3-point range. She was 4 for 4 in the first quarter as IU went on to set a program record on the road with 14 3-pointers while shooting a season-high 60.9%. Parrish ended up with 20 points (she finished 6 of 7 from 3-point range) and Mackenzie Holmes led the team with 22 points. “I thought we looked really together today, and tough from the jump,” Moren said. Nebraska’s comeback attempt goes nowhere There actually came a moment in the second half when Nebraska tried to make it a game. The Cornhuskers cut IU’s lead to under 10 points twice late in the third quarter to get the crowd on its feet. The good vibes at Pinnacle Bank Arena were short-lived with Hoosiers guards Lexus Bargesser and Sara Scalia stopping a potential rally before it started with quick baskets. Bargesser drove to the lane for a layup while Scalia dropped in a contested 3-pointer. “They knew that one of the things we had to do was keep the crowd out of it today, and we are a veteran team, we have a mature team, you always revert back to that,” Moren said. Indiana closed out the quarter on a 14-1 run — it didn’t allow a field goal in the final 3:49 — and Holmes took over in the paint with Alexis Markowski (four fouls) on the bench. Holmes had 11 points in the third quarter. By the time the buzzer sounded in the third, Indiana had its largest lead of the game at 69-49 and fans started trickling out to their cars. “One of the things about this group is that they stay in the moment,” Moren said.

    "text": "En una época marcada por el vértigo de las redes, la inmediatez y la sobreinformación, un rayo de esperanza se abre paso entre los algoritmos: se llama Felipe IA , una inteligencia artificial católica disponible en WhatsApp que responde en cualquier momento del día a quien busque consuelo, orientación o simplemente una palabra sobre Dios.\nDe acuerdo a Vaticano News, en el corazón de este proyecto se encuentra Eduardo Vitriago , un joven seminarista y desarrollador venezolano, quien sueña con una evangelización audaz, cercana y profundamente humana .\nEn la nota difundida, Vitriago se inspiró en el episodio de los Hechos de los Apóstoles donde el diácono Felipe acompaña al eunuco etíope en su búsqueda de sentido. Esta herramienta digital tiene como misión acompañar a quienes, aun en la soledad de la noche, necesitan respuestas.\n“ Felipe está disponible 24/7 y ya ha ayudado a personas con problemas existenciales, vacíos espirituales y crisis de sentido”, asegura Eduardo.\nEn la publicación, el seminarista venezolano explicó que Felipe IA no es un lujo, sino una urgencia.\n“Hoy, la inteligencia artificial también puede ser instrumento de Dios si se la configura con amor, verdad y fidelidad a la doctrina”, sostiene con convicción Vitriago , quién además señaló que hay un equipo de sacerdotes y laicos que velan por la precisión teológica, el respeto pastoral y la dimensión ética de cada interacción.\nIndicó que más allá de responder dudas sobre moral, Biblia o sacramentos, la herramienta también canaliza situaciones más complejas: sugiere buscar ayuda psicológica, dirección espiritual y encamina hacia el encuentro personal con Cristo. Eduardo confiesa que muchas veces la mayor satisfacción es ver que “ la gente aún tiene sed de Dios, de verdad, de belleza, de sentido. Y eso es profundamente esperanzador ”.\n«Dios también sabe de códigos, y si hace falta, se vale de un mensaje de WhatsApp para tocar el corazón humano”.",

A view of Chembrambakkam lake Photo | Express Updated on: 03 Jul 2025, 3:51 am 1 min read\nCopied\nFollow Us\nCHENNAI: Chennai’s water bodies may be contaminated with Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS), also known as ‘forever chemicals’, but Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) says there is no mandate nor technology available to treat them, both in drinking water and wastewater.\nThe submission was made by CMWSSB superintending engineer Sivakumar in an affidavit before the Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The tribunal had registered a suo motu case based on media reports highlighting alarming levels of PFAS in waterbodies, including drinking water sources such as Chembarambakkam lake.\nA recent study by IIT Madras, published in a scientific journal, found PFAS concentrations in the city’s water to be nearly 19,400 times higher than the safety levels set by the US Environmental Protection Agency. The chemicals were detected in groundwater near the Perungudi dumpyard, and in the Adyar river, Buckingham Canal, and Chembarambakkam lake.\n‘Forever chemicals’, due to their persistent nature and strong carbon-fluorine bonds, are widely used in products like non-stick cookware, food packaging, and firefighting foams. When present in drinking water, they pose serious health risks, including links to cancer and liver ailments.\nA metro water official stated that current treatment facilities are not equipped to remove PFAS due to inadequate infrastructure and limited technical expertise. However, CMWSSB maintains that it meets Indian Standard (IS:10500) requirements for treated water. Sivakumar said the Union Environment Ministry and the Central Pollution Control Board must issue specific guidelines for PFAS regulation.\nThough advanced PFAS treatment methods are being explored in the US, EU, Australia, and China, their adoption in developing countries remains limited due to high costs and lack of expertise.",
