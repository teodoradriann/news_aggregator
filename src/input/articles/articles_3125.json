    "text": "当地时间7月2日晚间至3日凌晨期间，印度尼西亚一艘客轮在巴厘海峡沉没。事故已造成至少4人死亡、61人失踪，已有25人获救。\n据央视新闻报道，客轮在从爪哇岛外南梦（Banyuwangi，或译巴纽旺宜）的吉打邦港（Ketapang Port）驶往旅游胜地巴厘岛的吉利马努克港（Gilimanuk Port）时倾覆。事故疑似因轮机舱发生泄漏造成。印尼政府内阁秘书泰迪（Teddy Indra Wijaya）3日晚些时候表示，事故起因是“恶劣天气”。\n来自印尼泗水的搜救机构3日声明说，该客轮在起锚约25分钟后沉没。此外，印尼吉利马努克港发布最新报告称，3日凌晨，涉事渡轮从吉打邦港前往吉利马努克港途中发出求救信号，称发动机舱漏水，并于数分钟后发生停电。随后船只倾覆并向南漂移，船只倾覆时所在的经纬度位置汇报给了相关部门。\n目前，由印尼国家警察和印尼国民军组成的联合小组已被派往现场处理和救援。特迪声明说，正在沙特阿拉伯访问的总统普拉博沃已下令立即展开应急响应。\n这艘渡轮名为“KMP Tunu Pratama Jaya”。根据搜救机构声明，船上载客数据显示，该渡轮载有客人总计53人，另有12名船员，船上还载有22辆汽车，其中包括14辆卡车。《卫报》报道提到，在印尼，船上实际人数与乘客名单不符的情况时有发生，因此失踪人数可能还会更多。搜救机构还说，3日凌晨已有4人获救，他们依靠渡轮上的救生艇完成自救。\n外南梦警察局长拉玛（Rama Samtama Putra）3日说，许多幸存者在海上漂流数小时，获救时已处于昏迷状态。搜救团队包括两艘拖船和两艘橡皮艇在内的九艘船只，正彻夜搜寻失踪人员，还需在过程中应对高达2米的海浪。\n从爪哇到巴厘岛的渡轮通常需时约一小时，常被驾车往返两岛的旅客使用。目前尚不清楚沉船时是否有外国人搭乘。总台记者从中国驻印尼使馆处获悉，截至目前，印尼客轮沉没事故中未报告涉及中国公民。\n印尼是一个由约17000座岛屿组成的群岛国家，因安全标准松懈及恶劣天气，海上事故时有发生。今年3月，1艘载有16人的船只在巴厘岛附近海域遇上恶浪翻覆，1名澳大利亚女子遇难，至少另有1人受伤。2018年，1艘渡轮在苏门答腊岛水域沉没，造成逾150人遇难。\n澎湃新闻记者 南博一",

    "title": "Why Biden’s order on the ‘out of control’ border may not fix Democrats’ political problem",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden has been trying to frame the November election around two subjects: his legislative accomplishments and former President Donald Trump’s fitness to serve.\nBut Biden’s own vulnerabilities have been getting in the way. High among them for many voters is a sense that the country is in chaos, fueled in part by images of an overwhelmed southern border that have flooded television screens and social media feeds since he took office.\n“The fentanyl that is coming across the border is coming into our communities,” said Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat from Nevada, where Biden is down by an average of 6 percentage points to Trump, in an interview. “The human trafficking that happens at the border comes into our communities.”\nThat helps explain why Biden took executive action this week — severely limiting the rights of migrants to seek asylum — that surprised and angered many allies on the left and could very well be struck down in court.\n“He did what he had to do, not just because it is a huge campaign issue, but because it’s a genuine problem,” said David Axelrod, who served as a top political advisor to former President Barack Obama. “He probably should have done it sooner.”\nBiden, Axelrod, Cortez Masto and other Democrats have been laying the border problem at the feet of Republicans, who tanked a bipartisan bill earlier this year that would have given the president more money and leverage for border enforcement, because Trump wanted to keep the issue alive for the campaign.\nBut despite his role in killing the enforcement bill, Trump maintains a big lead on the question of which candidate can better handle the problem, including an ABC poll released last month that showed he leads Biden 47% to 30% on whom to trust more on fixing the border.\nA campaign “is always a combination of offense and defense,” said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster.\nWhether it works or not, Biden is playing defense on this one.\nBut there are serious policy and political questions — some of which are out of his control — that could thwart the effort’s impact.\nHanding migrants back to their home countries in a speedy manner, as the Biden administration plans, works only if they are from Mexico and a handful of countries that are part of an agreement that allows Mexico to take them.\nMigrants from Russia, China, Venezuela and many other countries that have come in higher numbers of late are likely to remain stuck in a clogged asylum system that could allow them to await a hearing in the United States, regardless of whether the administration attempts to limit their options, said Ariel Ruiz Soto, senior policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.\nRuiz Soto predicts the number of border crossings will stay relatively low — as it has been in recent months — for a couple of months while smugglers and migrants figure out whether there are loopholes to exploit in the new system.\nBut later in the summer, a variety of factors beyond Biden’s control could emerge, including the potential reelection of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in July, which could spark another wave of migrants seeking escape from that country’s security, economic and political crisis.\nBiden must also depend on continued help from Mexico under newly elected President Claudia Sheinbaum. So far this year, the country is on pace to surpass the record number of migrants it apprehended last year, he said.\nOne of the biggest flaws in the new policy is that it lacks money for enforcement and the heightened level of protection in the courts that a law passed by Congress would have provided. Republicans, despite their own culpability in tanking congressional efforts, immediately labeled Biden’s bill “a scam.”\n“If you want the border secured and you want this group to do it, you’re going to die waiting,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who supported the bipartisan package, told reporters this week.\nMany of Biden’s critics predicted the action will be held up in court while arguing that the administration would be happy with a delay.\n“The most immediate thing he was trying to do was come up for a talking point for the debate with Trump later this month,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that supports tighter controls on immigration. “He needs to at least pretend to be doing something.”\nNot all Democrats are convinced there is much to be gained for Biden either.\nPolls tend to show the issue ranks highly among Americans’ concerns; immigration consistently ranks third after the economy and government/leadership issues in monthly polls conducted by Gallup.\nBut polls that break the issue down by party often show most of the concern is on the Republican side. “I don’t necessarily think that there are a whole lot of persuadable voters who think this is the most important issue,” said Greenberg, who also conducts focus groups.\nBut many elected Democrats in battleground states and districts were among the quickest to support Biden’s new policy, suggesting they at least see a need for some protection against Republican attacks.\nVoters are seeing a “process that looks like it’s out of control for immigration and they want a secure process,” Greenberg said.\nAnd that includes Latino voters, who want both security and fairness in the system, said Cortez Masto, who is of Mexican heritage. “And I’ve talked to them and you can do both” if Congress acts, she added.\nPolls show Biden losing support among Latinos compared with previous Democrats, including Obama, who won more than 70% of the Latino vote in his 2012 reelection. But Fernand Amando, who led Obama’s polling efforts with Latinos in both of his elections, said it usually ranks fifth or sixth in importance, depending on the poll.\n“Immigration is not the animating issue for Hispanic voters, who by definition are not directly impacted by immigration policy given that they are citizens,” he said. “That doesn’t mean it’s not an important issue, but it’s not the be-all, end-all issue that’s been ascribed to them.”\nLatino activist groups and some leading politicians are nonetheless furious and have warned Democrats that they could suffer from a further lack of enthusiasm at the ballot box. The California Latino Legislative Caucus urged Biden to reverse the order.\n“We cannot afford to return to Trump-era immigration policies that threaten the lives of refugees or delegitimize migrants for the sake of political expediency,” Assemblymember Sabrina Cervantes, a Riverside Democrat who chairs the group, said in a statement.\nU.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., who has emerged as Biden’s biggest immigration critic on the left, said the president still has time to fulfill campaign promises to fix the system in a more holistic way that would provide legal protections for more essential workers and farmers who were praised during the pandemic but are now threatened with deportation by Biden.\nIn the meantime, he wants the party to go back to playing offense.\n“You want to see chaos and disorder?” he said in an interview. “If Trump were to get reelected … family separations and mass deportations. That would create chaos and disorder in communities across the country and to our economy.”",

    "text": "MOSCA - L’uso in pubblico dei simboli riconducibili alla comunità Lgbtq , come la bandiera arcobaleno , o anche solo la dichiarazione di appartenenza a tale gruppo, il “ coming out ”, in Russia sono valutati alla stregua dell’adesione a un movimento di matrice estremista e pertanto puniti dalla legge. È quanto contenuto in una nota esplicativa della Direzione regionale di Stavropol del Ministero della Giustizia. Certo, il documento ha solo valore di raccomandazione, ma dopo la decisione adottata il 30 novembre dalla Corte Suprema di inserire il cosiddetto “movimento Lgbtq” tra le organizzazioni “estremiste”, le autorità e i promotori dei “valori tradizionali” sembrano vedere ovunque i segni della propaganda.\nLa Russia mette al bando per estremismo il movimento Lgbt internazionale di Riccardo Ricci 30 Novembre 2023\nIn alcuni casi, la caccia alle streghe innescata dal nuovo giro di vite contro la diffusione dei “valori non tradizionali” assume toni che sfiorano il ridicolo. Non si tratta soltanto della serata “quasi-nudista” delle celebrità russe , che da giorni riempie le pagine dei tabloid. Né delle incursioni delle forze dell’ordine nei locali frequentati dalla comunità Lgbtq, iniziate immediatamente dopo la pronuncia della Corte Suprema.\nIl prof vestito da “fanciulla di neve” Nella città di Nakhodka, nell’Estremo Oriente, in vista del Capodanno gli insegnanti di una scuola pubblica hanno organizzato una festa in maschera durante la quale un insegnante di educazione fisica si è travestito da Snegurochka, la figura femminile che tradizionalmente accompagna il Babbo Natale russo. Alcuni genitori, preoccupati che un uomo vestito da “Fanciulla di neve” potesse minacciare i valori della famiglia tradizionale, hanno accusato la scuola di diffondere “valori occidentali”. La direzione scolastica ha dovuto scusarsi e spiegare che il riferimento non era alla leggenda popolare, bensì al famoso cartone animato sovietico Nu, Pogodi! , in cui un lupo appare travestito, appunto, da Snegurochka.\nMosca pensa a un “patto di lealtà” per stranieri. “Così si impegnano a non screditare le autorità russe” di Riccardo Ricci 29 Novembre 2023\nIl giallo del Google Map russo A inizio settimana, molti media hanno diffuso la curiosa notizia della scomparsa dalla sezione “Mappe” del provider Yandex del Mar Egeo, in russo “Egejskoe More”. Molti utenti utenti hanno sospettato che potesse dipendere dalla combinazione delle tre lettere “gej”, che in russo compongono la parola “gay”. Qualcuno si è preoccupato di verificare se anche l’isola di Lesbo fosse scomparsa dalla mappa. Yandex ha poi rassicurato tutti con un comunicato in cui spiegava che si trattava solo di un problema di grafica, non prima che gli utenti potessero divertirsi a cercare Geyve in Turchia e Gaylord Lake negli Usa.\nLa crociata di Putin contro i diritti Lgbt: ora la Russia vieta anche le transizioni di genere dalla nostra inviata Rosalba Castelletti 24 Luglio 2023\nLe teorie complottiste sul Mar Egeo sono state alimentate anche dall’inaspettato cambio di nome dell'Istituto geologico di San Pietroburgo “Vsegei”, che in russo ricorda l’espressione “Vse Ghej”, ovvero “Tutti Gay”. Il passaggio all’altra denominazione, Istituto Karpinskij, è stato notato dagli utenti del web solo di recente. Anche in questo caso la direzione si è sentita in dovere di dare spiegazioni. “Tra i compiti della nuova amministrazione - ha spiegato l’ufficio stampa - c'è il ringiovanimento dell'agenda internazionale e Istituto Karpinskij sembra più attraente della vecchia sigla\". Nella capitale del Nord già a inizio anno il festival teatrale “Raduga”, letteralmente “Arcobaleno” ha rinunciato al proprio brand, proprio per evitare le norme sulla propaganda Lgbtq adottate lo scorso dicembre.\nLe nuove leggi A fine 2022, il presidente Vladimir Putin ha firmato una legge che rende più restrittivi i divieti di “propaganda Lgbtq” e “il cambio di genere”, che in precedenza si applicavano solo in presenza di minori. La nuova legge ha colpito in modo significativo i settori del cinema e dell’editoria. Diverse piattaforme di streaming sono state multate per “propaganda Lgbtq”. Librerie e biblioteche hanno iniziato a rimuovere dai loro scaffali i libri che potevano rientrare nell’ambito di applicazione della legge.\nIl caso più recente riguarda la casa editrice Eksmo, multata per circa 9 mila euro, a causa di un fumetto presente in catalogo, Il Piccione Gennadij , dell'artista ucraina Koro. Alla base delle accuse sembra esserci la descrizione del pennuto: “I piccioni non sempre distinguono i rispettivi sessi. Pertanto, Gennadij preferisce pensare di essere pansessuale”. In natura è un fenomeno raro, ma presente.\nQuesto è un articolo a pagamento, ma oggi te lo regaliamo.\nBuona lettura! LEGGI Chiudi Leggi i commenti I commenti dei lettori",

    "text": "STORY AT-A-GLANCE\nGlyphosate exposure strongly correlates with fatty liver disease, affecting 100 million Americans including children. Higher urinary levels of the glyphosate byproduct aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) predict increased liver dysfunction and fat accumulation\nEarly childhood exposure creates lasting health risks, with children having doubled AMPA levels at age 5 showing 55% higher odds of developing metabolic syndrome by 18\nProximity to agricultural fields increases exposure severity, as children living within half-mile of glyphosate-treated areas show significantly elevated liver enzymes and metabolic syndrome indicators\nGlyphosate disrupts multiple biological systems through endocrine interference, oxidative stress generation, and gut microbiome disruption, leading to chronic inflammation and cellular damage throughout the body\nOrganic food choices and water filtration significantly reduce exposure, along with supporting gut health through fermented foods and limiting processed restaurant meals containing contaminated ingredients\nAdvertisement Fatty liver is a common form of liver disease in the U.S., and according to the American Liver Foundation, it now affects around 100 million Americans, including children. 1 Left unchecked, it leads to scarring of liver cells, eventually hampering this organ’s function. Today, research shows that glyphosate is one of the biggest contributors to this disease.\nYour Liver Is Paying the Price\nA comprehensive analysis published in Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology reviewed 42 studies to investigate glyphosate, one of the most widely used herbicides in the world, and its direct connection to fatty liver disease. 2 3\nGlyphosate linked to fatty liver disease — The researchers concluded that people exposed to higher levels of glyphosate and its breakdown metabolite, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), showed greater signs of liver dysfunction and higher fatty liver index (FLI) scores. The strongest effects were seen in women ages between 40 and 60 with borderline diabetes.\nGlyphosate level in urine is a key indicator — Researchers used urine samples to show how much glyphosate was in the test subjects. In essence, they noted that higher levels of glyphosate in urine correlate to higher risk of build up of liver fat. Eventually, this leads to scarring of liver tissue (fibrosis).\nOther chronic diseases are at play — The researchers found that groups with the highest levels of urinary glyphosate also had more instances of high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes.\nGlyphosate triggers inflammation — Based on the animal studies included in the analysis, the researchers noted that glyphosate is highly likely to cause liver inflammation , which leads to scarring, oxidative stress, and fat buildup. Mechanistically, it interferes with the fat metabolism process in your cells, which leads to dysfunction.\nEarly Glyphosate Exposure Means Bigger Health Risks Later\nA study published in Environmental Health Perspectives investigated what happens when children are exposed to glyphosate over a long time. Researchers from the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS) study at University of California (UC), Berkeley tracked 480 mother-child pairs from pregnancy through adolescence, specifically measuring glyphosate and AMPA in urine. 4\nBy the time the children turned 18 years old, researchers measured markers indicating liver inflammation (high levels of liver enzymes) and metabolic syndrome.\nEarly-life glyphosate exposure harms children — Moreover, it strongly predicted future health complications. To put this in perspective, the researchers found that if a child’s AMPA level doubled around age 5, their odds of developing metabolic syndrome by age 18 rose by an alarming 55%.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nThis included increased abdominal fat, elevated blood pressure, and problematic blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Moreover, the risk of liver inflammation, indicated by elevated liver enzymes, climbed by 27% for every twofold increase in AMPA at the same young age.\nThe impact of early exposure — Being exposed to glyphosate at a younger age proved far more impactful than exposure later in adolescence. Children who showed elevated glyphosate and AMPA earlier, around 5 years old, faced greater health risks as teenagers compared to those whose exposure peaked later.\nWhere you live affects exposure levels — Those living closest to agricultural fields sprayed regularly with glyphosate had notably higher levels of these chemicals in their bodies, and, consequently, more severe health outcomes. In other words, proximity to farming activity played a massive role. Children living within a half-mile of treated fields had the greatest elevations in liver enzymes and had significantly more indicators of metabolic syndrome compared to their peers who lived further away.\nNot all metabolic syndrome markers react the same way to glyphosate exposure — Among the measured indicators (waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting serum glucose, and cholesterol) the strongest associations occurred among those with larger waist circumferences. Essentially, children who are overweight or obese are more likely to develop fatty liver later in life.\nTheories on mechanisms behind glyphosate’s effects — How exactly does glyphosate exert such profound effects? The researchers theorize several key biological mechanisms, including endocrine disruption , meaning glyphosate interferes with hormone regulation in the body. “[G]lyphosate and glyphosate-containing herbicides can disrupt endocrine-signaling systems,” the researchers said. 5\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nYour endocrine system is an important cornerstone to overall health. The hormones produced by it help regulate important functions throughout your body, such as reproduction, growth, and metabolic function. Therefore, any disruption in its role throws your health off balance.\nAnother theory involves oxidative stress — When glyphosate enters your body, it triggers the production of harmful free radicals, damaging tissues. These harmful compounds overwhelm your body’s natural defenses, causing inflammation and cellular damage.\nGlyphosate disrupts your gut microbiome — The final theory behind the impact of glyphosate on human health is how it disrupts the gut microbiome. Specifically, it’s been shown to affect the shikimate pathway, which is the process revolving around carbohydrate metabolism. 6\nGlyphosate Levels Predict Severity of Liver Disease\nA study published in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology from researchers at UC San Diego focused on whether glyphosate exposure matches the severity of liver disease in adults. Specifically, they aimed to determine if higher levels of glyphosate and AMPA in urine correlated with more severe forms of fatty liver disease, including advanced fibrosis and steatohepatitis, a condition marked by liver inflammation and significant damage. 7\nThe research involved 97 adults, all with confirmed fatty liver disease via biopsy. Participants ranged from those with mild fat accumulation in the liver (simple steatosis) to severe inflammation and fibrosis (scarring).\nAs glyphosate levels rose, the liver's condition worsened — Participants with confirmed fatty liver disease had significantly higher concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA in their urine compared to those with milder forms of the condition. These elevated chemical residues corresponded to worse liver scarring and inflammation.\nEven modest increases in glyphosate exposure dramatically affected liver health — Participants with higher glyphosate levels exhibited increased markers of liver fibrosis. More scar tissue in the liver eventually impairs its ability to function properly. Left unchecked, fibrosis progresses to cirrhosis.\nOther variables are not as influential as glyphosate — For instance, glyphosate concentrations consistently showed a stronger link to liver damage severity compared to other risk factors like age, body mass index (BMI), or alcohol use.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nEven after adjusting for these other known influences on liver disease, glyphosate exposure stood out as a distinct and powerful risk factor. That means even if you're otherwise healthy, you’re still at increased risk if your glyphosate exposure remains elevated.\nHow to Reduce Your Glyphosate Exposure and Protect Your Liver\nBased on the published research, it’s clear that glyphosate has no place in agriculture as it drastically affects liver health of the public. However, since it’s still being used ubiquitously, avoidance is the best way to lower your exposure. Here are five practical ways:\nFilter your drinking water — Glyphosate frequently contaminates tap water, 8 so every time you drink from your tap or wash your hands, you’re exposing yourself to this toxin. That said, installing a high-quality water filter in your home will eliminate glyphosate and other harmful chemicals, such as heavy metals. There are different water filter systems available, so take your time to find out what works best for your home and budget.\nSupport your gut microbiome — As noted in the Environmental Health Perspectives study, glyphosate disrupts your gut microbiome, which is crucial to your overall health. To help reverse this, nourish your microbiome by adding fermented foods like sauerkraut or kefir to your diet.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nIn addition, introduce foods that contain fiber to produce butyrate, which is what your colonocytes use to create a strong gut barrier. For more tips on how to repair your gut, read “ Butyrate — The Metabolic Powerhouse Fueling the Gut and Beyond .”\nReduce your toxin load by making your own food at home — Restaurant foods are loaded with vegetable oils high in linoleic acid (LA), and the ingredients used in these foods likely come from genetically modified produce that’s sprayed with glyphosate from start to finish.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nThat said, removing LA will help lower inflammation and spare you from further damage. I recommend keeping your LA intake below 5 grams per day. If you can get it down to 2 grams, that’s even better.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nMy upcoming Mercola Health Coach App features the Seed-Oil Sleuth™, which will masterfully steer you through grocery aisles and restaurant menus to pinpoint every hidden source of industrial seed oils in your meals, then calculate your daily intake to the nearest tenth of a gram. Scan the QR code below to join the early-access list and be first in line for smarter, cleaner eating.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nBoost your choline intake — If tests show that you already have fatty deposits in your liver, boosting your choline intake will help . That’s because deficiency in this nutrient leads to liver fat buildup due to impaired very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nYour liver produces VLDL to transport fat and cholesterol throughout your body, and if it doesn’t have enough choline, the fat stays in the liver instead. Considering this, boost your choline intake via pastured egg yolks, arugula, grass fed beef liver, or a high-quality citicoline supplement.\nChoose glyphosate-free organic foods — Glyphosate primarily enters your body through food, especially vegetables and grains that are grown conventionally.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nStart by switching to organic or certified glyphosate-free brands. I recommend checking labels carefully. In the next section, I’ll show you different resources to help you find quality, sustainable produce.\nFind Organic, Chemical-Free Produce Here\nIf you live in a dense, urban location in the U.S. that doesn't have any local farmers markets, don't worry. There are plenty of ways to connect with reputable organic farmers who employ sustainable practices that deliver to your home. Below is a list of websites I recommend:\nAmerican Grassfed Association — The goal of the American Grassfed Association (AGA) is to promote the grass fed industry through government relations, research, concept marketing and public education.\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published\nTheir website also allows you to search for AGA-approved producers certified according to strict standards that include being raised on a diet of 100% forage; raised on pasture and never confined to a feedlot; never treated with antibiotics or hormones; born and raised on American family farms.\nEatWild.com — EatWild.com provides lists of farmers known to produce raw dairy products as well as grass fed beef and other farm-fresh produce (although not all are certified organic). Here you will also find information about local farmers markets, as well as local stores and restaurants that sell grass fed products.\nWeston A. Price Foundation — The organization has local chapters in most states, and many of them are connected with buying clubs in which you can easily purchase organic foods, including grass fed, raw dairy products like milk and butter.\nGrassfed Exchange — The Grassfed Exchange has a listing of producers selling organic and grass fed meats across the U.S.\nLocal Harvest — This website will help you find farmers markets, family farms and other sources of sustainably grown food in your area where you can buy produce, grass fed meats and many other goodies.\nFarmers Markets — A national listing of farmers markets.\nEat Well Guide: Wholesome Food from Healthy Animals — The Eat Well Guide is a free online directory of sustainably raised meat, poultry, dairy and eggs from farms, stores, restaurants, inns, hotels and online outlets in the U.S. and Canada.\nCommunity Involved in Sustaining Agriculture (CISA) — CISA is dedicated to sustaining agriculture and promoting the products of small farms.\nThe Cornucopia Institute — This website maintains web-based tools rating all certified organic brands of eggs, dairy products and other commodities, based on their ethical sourcing and authentic farming practices separating CAFO (concentrated animal feeding operation) \"organic\" production from authentic organic practices.\nRealMilk.com — If you're still unsure of where to find raw milk, check out Raw-Milk-Facts.com and RealMilk.com. They can tell you what the status is for legality in your state, and provide a listing of raw dairy farms in your area. The Farm to Consumer Legal Defense Fund also provides a state-by-state review of raw milk laws. 9 California residents can also find raw milk retailers using the store locator available at RAW FARM. 10\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Glyphosate and Fatty Liver Disease\nQ: What is fatty liver disease, and why is glyphosate linked to it?\nA: Fatty liver disease involves excessive fat buildup in liver cells, leading to inflammation and scarring. Glyphosate, a widely used herbicide, significantly contributes to this disease by disrupting fat metabolism, increasing oxidative stress, and causing inflammation.\nQ: How does glyphosate exposure impact children specifically?\nA: Early childhood exposure to glyphosate greatly increases the risk of liver inflammation and metabolic syndrome later in life. Children exposed around age 5 have significantly higher chances of developing these issues by adolescence compared to those exposed later.\nQ: What are some signs indicating glyphosate exposure?\nA: Higher levels of glyphosate and its breakdown metabolite, AMPA, detected in urine samples correlate strongly with increased liver fat accumulation, liver inflammation, fibrosis, obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure.\nQ: Does glyphosate affect everyone equally?\nA: Glyphosate exposure particularly affects women aged 40 to 60 with borderline diabetes and individuals living near agricultural fields. Even modest exposure can severely worsen liver conditions regardless of other health factors like age, BMI, or alcohol intake.\nQ: What practical steps can I take to reduce my glyphosate exposure?\nA: You can reduce glyphosate exposure by installing a high-quality water filter, supporting gut health with probiotics and fiber-rich foods, preparing meals at home to avoid processed oils and GMO ingredients, boosting dietary choline, and choosing organic or certified glyphosate-free foods.\nNEXT ARTICLE >>\nDisclaimer : The entire contents of this website are based upon the opinions of Dr. Mercola, unless otherwise noted.

    "text": "Trending\nOpinion: How will Project 2025 impact game developers?\nThe Heritage Foundation's manifesto for the possible next administration could do great harm to many, including large portions of the game development community.\nGoing out on a high note.\nBefore he retires from Insomniac Games, founder and CEO Ted Price will be inducted into the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences' (AIAS) Hall of Fame.\nPrice will be honored during February's DICE Awards in recognition for his long tenure at the PlayStation studio. In its announcement, Academy president Meggan Scavio deemed him \"a visionary and steadfast leader. Ted has left an indelible mark on our industry, and his legacy encompasses a portfolio of beloved and critically acclaimed games, a studio that holds him in the highest regard, and a profound impact on the Academy itself.\"\nEarlier this week, Price revealed he's going to leave Insomniac and the larger game industry in March. After his departure, Insomniac will be led by longtime employees Ryan Scheider, Jen Huang, and Chad Dezern.\nSchneider will present the award to Price, and described him to the Academy as \"a Hall of Fame game development leader and an even better human. [...] He embodies Insomniac’s vision of making a positive and lasting impact on people’s lives, inspiring countless employees, partners and players in a truly remarkable legacy.\"\nPreviously, Price served as the Academy's chairman and vice chairman, and hosted its Game Maker's Notebook podcast. He joins previous Hall of Fame inductees such as longtime Mario composer Koji Kondo, NetherRealm's Ed Boon, and fellow PlayStation alum Connie Booth.\nDuring her time at PlayStation, Booth had a key hand in developing several key franchises for the brand, including Insomniac's very own Ratchet and Clank, Resistance, and Marvel's Spider-Man. The pair make for the only two Sony representatives in the Hall of Fame.\nThe DICE Awards, and Price's induction into the AIAS Hall of Fame, will air on Thursday, February 13.\nRead more about:\nYou May Also Like",
