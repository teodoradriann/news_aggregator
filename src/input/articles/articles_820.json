    "text": "‘He ruined it’: Indian barber asks UK vlogger for ₹1,800 for haircut, divides internet\nGeorge Buckley, a UK-based travel vlogger, says he was overcharged at a barber shop in India, igniting a heated debate.\nBritish travel vlogger and content creator George Buckley recently shared an Instagram reel detailing how he was overcharged at a barber shop during his trip to India, an incident that has sparked widespread discussion online.\nIn his video, Buckley claims he was initially quoted ₹1,800 for a basic haircut and head massage. As he hesitated, the price quickly dropped to ₹1,500, then ₹1,200. Sensing something was off, Buckley turned to other customers in the shop and asked, “How much do you guys pay?” but received no response. When he pressed further, the barber admitted that the usual charge for the service is ₹700- ₹800.\nAlso read: Man says he has post-partum depression after quitting ₹2.3 lakh job to take care of baby\nDespite the back-and-forth, Buckley ended up paying ₹1,200. He left the shop without tipping and later took to Instagram to share his experience. In the caption, he wrote, “I was going to tip but he ruined it 🇮🇳.”\nHe added, “After a fair bit of experience travelling Asia, you can tell when you’re getting overcharged and this was definitely one of those moments! I was planning on giving him a tip but honesty comes first. Hopefully he doesn’t try the same trick on another traveller. A slightly sour end to the haircut, but an interesting experience nonetheless!”\nTake a look at the video:\nThe post quickly gained traction, drawing mixed reactions in the comments section.\nOne user defended the barber, writing, “Devil’s advocate here — why not pay the man who can barely afford to live his ₹1,800? It’s like £15-20, which is what you’d pay in the UK. Why haggle him down over £5? It makes zero difference to you and a huge difference to his life. I’d have tipped him an extra ₹1,800 instead of haggling over pennies.”\nAnother viewer disagreed, saying, “Yes, you were overcharged for a basic head massage and a haircut. It should probably be somewhere around ₹300-400.”\nAlso read: Bengaluru founder accused of lying about ₹4.2 lakh salary says it’s ‘common in tech’\nAnother wrote, “Hey! They probably overcharged because you’re a foreigner, which unfortunately happens in some local spots. But that’s not how most of India is. Please don’t judge the whole country by one experience. Next time, try visiting good, high-end shops where prices are fair and service is reliable. India has a lot of honest and welcoming people—I hope you get to see the real side of it.”\nTrending NewsViral News, Video, Photos and\nWeather Updatesof India and around the world\nTrending NewsViral News, Video, Photos and\nWeather Updatesof India and around the world",

    "title": "PCHR: Destruction of Gaza's Healthcare System: A Manifestation of Genocide",
    "text": "The Palestinian Center For Human Rights (PCHR) : The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) warns that the Israeli Occupation Forces’ (IOF) destruction of what remains of the healthcare system in the Gaza Strip has gone beyond collapse and inability to provide the bare minimum healthcare services and has reached a critical and irreversible stage.\nPCHR emphasizes that the humanitarian catastrophe is alarmingly deteriorating as the IOF escalate their crimes, targeting the very foundations of Palestinian existence in the Gaza Strip.\nThis is happening amid the international community’s disturbing silence, persistent inaction and continued evasion of their legal obligations, particularly those of the High Contracting Parties to the four Geneva Conventions.\nNotably, Switzerland, the depository state of the Conventions, continues to explicitly procrastinate the convening of an emergency meeting of the State Parties despite months having passed since the proposed date last March.\nAccording to PCHR’s monitoring, the entire healthcare system is on the verge of total collapse due to the full halt of fuel and electricity supplies. This means the suspension of total essential and lifesaving medical services, including the cessation of surgeries, shutdown of radiology equipment and laboratories, and stoppage of oxygen plants- posing an immediate threat to the intensive care units and neonatal incubators.\nMoreover, treatment for cancer patients, heart patients and other critical cases requiring specialized and advanced medical interventions has been almost totally suspended. If the current situation continues like this, civilians will be left without any access to life-saving healthcare services.\nIn this context, the administration of al-Shifa Medical Complex in Gaza declared the complete suspension of dialysis services, threatening the lives of 250 patients, mostly children, women and elderlies. 1\nIt should be noted that 41% of the kidney failure patients – out of a total of around 1200 patients, died over the past 22 months due to being denied regular access to treatment within a besieged and isolated healthcare system. This harrowing percentage only reflects a very small part of the reality as each patient in the Gaza Strip. Today every patient in Gaza from newborns to cancer patients faces the threat of a slow death due to the full collapse of the healthcare infrastructure.\nIn parallel, the Gaza Strip is facing an alarming and serious outbreak of Infectious meningitis, particularly among children in overcrowded shelters.\nThis outbreak is driven by the widespread contamination from sewage water and accumulated garbage surrounding the displaced people’s tents and near their gatherings, creating ideal conditions for disease transmission. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has reported hundreds of meningitis cases among children amid a severe shortage of antibiotics necessary for the treatment of this type of disease.\nThe MOH has raised serious concerns over the potential spread of other diseases such as cholera, Intestinal infections and respiratory diseases, particularly among children. The crisis is getting more complicated with the presence of main hospitals like Naser Medical Complex in Khan Younis and al-Ahlai Baptist Hospital in Gaza City within areas subjected to IOF’s evacuation orders.\nThis has rendered access to essential healthcare services for patients and the wounded extremely difficult, stripping them of their right to treatment. All of this is unfolding while the window to push back starvation in Gaza is closing fast. 2\nDr. Ragheb Warsh al-Agha, Head of the Pediatric Department at Al-Rantisi Children’s Hospital, stated that hospitals have recorded 337 meningitis cases, including 259 viral infections. He added that the number of infections is rising significantly on a daily basis amid the collapse of the healthcare system and scarcity of clean water and personal hygiene supplies, which in turn exacerbates the spread of infectious diseases in shelters that lack even the most basic public health standards.\nHe pointed out that the conditions in these shelters are unsanitary and instead promote the rapid spread of epidemics, warning of a complete loss of control unless urgent measures are taken to provide the necessary antibiotics to treat the disease, along with emergency support for healthcare facilities. 3\nThese documented facts constitute, in essence, a direct implementation of the elements of the crime of genocide as defined by the 1948 United Nations Convention, particularly Article II, which refers to “deliberately inflicting on a national group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.”\nThe systematic destruction of hospitals, the denial of medical treatment to patients, the prevention of fuel entry, and the spread of epidemics in residential areas are not incidental or unforeseen consequences of the Israeli military aggression, but rather a deliberate policy aimed at physically, environmentally, and psychologically eradicating the Gaza Strip population and undermining their existence on their land.\nPCHR stresses that the targeting of Gaza’s healthcare system, the forced evacuation of hospitals, and the denial of access to them constitute grave breaches of international humanitarian law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention, and amount to war crimes under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The international community’s silence and inaction are considered forms of indirect complicity allowing Israel to persist in these atrocities with complete impunity.\nPCHR considers what is going on in the Gaza Strip as a full-fledged war crime and a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention, and States that have thus far failed to fulfill their legal obligations bear responsibility for the continuation of these atrocities.\nThis international inaction, particularly on the part of the High Contracting Parties and Switzerland in particular as the depositary state, amounts to explicit complicity. It fosters a culture of impunity and provides political cover for Israel to continue committing its crimes.\nIf a meeting of the States Parties is not convened amid this unprecedented humanitarian and health collapse, then when will it be? And when will these states assume their legal, political, and moral responsibilities? Israel would not have dared to commit such crimes without this alarming absence of accountability and the silence that amounts to indirect complicity in the crime.\nTherefore, PCHR calls for an urgent and unconditional international intervention to allow the entry of fuel, medicines, and medical supplies immediately into the Gaza Strip; to provide clean water, hygiene, and sanitation supplies within shelters and hospitals; and to dispatch emergency medical missions to protect what remains of the healthcare system and halt this comprehensive collapse.\nPCHR also urges the States Parties to the Geneva Conventions and the Genocide Convention to take immediate action to hold Israeli authorities accountable for these crimes, which constitute grave violations and acts of genocide against the besieged civilian population.",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#1](c1#c-1) Bueno, es que es un tema polémico de cojones. Quitando a esos radicales religiosos, la gran duda y cuestión médica y moral es ¿Hasta cuándo? No es lo mismo abortar un embarazo de 3 meses que de 8.\nLo que sí es curioso es que los \"pro-vida\" están en contra del aborto pero habitualmente a favor de la pena de muerte, WTF? No son muy coherentes.\n[#6](c6#c-6) No es lo mismo abortar un embarazo de 3 meses que de 8.\nEse debate, desde un punto de vista médico, está bastante superado. Tanto por el grado de formación del embrión o feto, como por la complicaciones y riesgos de la intervención para la madre en función de los meses de gestación.\nTienes muchísima información a tu disposición. cc\n[#8](c8#c-8)\nLo segundo que dices, es que en realidad no son pro-vida. Son pro-hazloqueyodiga y jódete.\n[#10](c10#c-10) Eso no son cuestiones médicas, el médico te dirá cuando empieza a correr peligo la vida de la madre, o cuando es ya viable el feto... la medicina te responde las preguntas, pero son cuestiones de ética o moral. Es como el código penal, convenciones como matar o robar está mal. Y por eso la sociedad implementa castigos para quien cometa esas acciones.\n[#15](c15#c-15) Totalmente de acuerdo, la ciencia no nos da criterios morales, como mucho nos aporta información, amplia nuestros criterios con informaciones objetivas, pero por ejemplo, no te dice que esté bien matar/abortar al feto porque peligre la vida de la madre, no sea viable, o porque no esté lo suficientemente desarrollado.\nRecuerdo que alguna vez se mencionaba que si su sistema nervioso central está desarrollado para sentir dolor, pero según se vea, ese criterio es tan arbitario como cualquier otro. Vaya, te lo vas a cargar, pero si siente dolor ya no porque eso sería malvado. Es bastante infantil...\n[#45](c45#c-45) A eso voy, el criterio científico puede entrar en aspectos objetivos, lo que llamas motivación es una parte subjetiva que es dónde las personas han decidio poner la línea roja, no voy a discutir ahora si es sobre dolor o sobre actividad cerebral porque no es el punto de mi comentario pero he leído bastante sobre ese tipo de argumentos.\n[#15](c15#c-15) Desde luego que son cuestiones médico-biológicas determinar cuándo un embrión pasa a ser un feto o cuándo no es viable por peligro de la madre. ¡Cómo no van a ser cuestiones médicas!\nLos temas éticos o morales van por otro lado, pero mi comentario empezaba diciendo \"desde un punto de vista médico\". No mezcles cosas.\n[#11](c11#c-11) De hecho en general el feminismo tiene muchas más incoherencias, y en todo caso creo que es parte de \"vivir\" el abordar esas incoherencias. Por ejemplo, se puede argumentar que un feto no tiene culpa, mientras que un asesino simplemente es responsable de las consecuencias de sus actos.\nSegún se veo, no veo incoherencia en ello... si quieres ser extremo, hasta diría que un pro-vida debería ser partidario de prohibir cualquier actividad peligrosa o de riesgo, pero es muy absurdo. Y en todo caso, quizás no haya nada más \"pro-vida\" que condenar a muerte a un asesino...\nEn fin, como decia, vivir en parte es conciliar nuestras incoherencias.\n[#11](c11#c-11) Resumiendo el tema muchísimo: Estamos en contra de mercantilizar los cuerpos. Por eso tampoco estamos a favor de los vientres de alquiler.\n[#40](c40#c-40) No compares ser violada o pasar por un embarazo con hacerse una paja (en el caso del esperma) o con donaciones o actos que pueden salvar la vida a personas. La donación de óvulo no debería ser remunerada.\n[#46](c46#c-46) No fui yo quien empleó el término genérico \"mercantilizar los cuerpos\". si realmente te referías a otra cosa, como \"renovar el mantra ultra puritano de que el sexo es malo\". haberlo dicho. La prostitución es sustento de muchas personas, igual que el único camino al disfrute de su sexualidad para muchos discapacitados.\n[#48](c48#c-48) Lo importante es que cuando le gente te pone líneas rojas muy claras, por supuesto siempre tienen su lista de excepciones para los casos que sí consideran necesarios.\nA mi lo de mercatilizar el cuerpo, no me parece que ni siquiera excluya a cualquier trabajo manual, al final quieres una \"máquina\" que haga cosas, si no lo puede hacer un autómata, lo hace una persona. Y sobre que sea necesario, es más que discutible el tema del sexo para, por ejemplo, personas discapacitadas, no deja de ser parte de su salud sexual.\nhttps://www.elconfidencial.com/sociedad/2016-09-04/sexo-discapacitados-tandem-team-asistencia-sexual_1254701/\n[#53](c53#c-53) [#46](c46#c-46) El sexo no es un derecho. En el momento en que cobras por tener sexo, estás teniendo relaciones bajo coacción, no libres y consentidas. ¿O crees que las prostitutas disfrutan teniendo sexo con ciertos hombres? Y eso de que \"es un sustento\" tampoco me vale. El porcentaje de mujeres que lo hacen porque quieren, no por necesidad, es mínimo. Si fuera un trabajo tan fácil, todos los hombres con problemas económicos se prostituirían. Eso sí, casi todos los clientes son hombres.\nLo de los discapacitados no es excusa. De hecho, el otro día leí un hilo en Twitter de un discapacitado muy crítico con lo que dices:\n[#7](c7#c-7) ¿Te refieres a esto?\nhttp://copred.cdmx.gob.mx/comunicacion/nota/urgente-replantear-en-las-escuelas-las-celebraciones-donde-se-exalta-un-unico-modelo-de-familia\nLo que plantean es que no todos los niños tienen padre, por lo que abogan por un enfoque más inclusivo.\n[#21](c21#c-21) ya et digo que les piden a las escuelas no festejar el dia del padre...\neso no es un enfoque inclusivo.... eso es ideologia\n[#7](c7#c-7) Eso dice el Quique peinado que a él le parece fatal que se celebre el día del padre (del de la madre no dice nada porque él madre presente sí que tiene) porque como él no tuvo uno pues que los demás no lo pueden celebrar porque eso es hacerle un feo al crío en vez de explicarle y apoyarle.\n[#5](c5#c-5) Un crío es una excelente manera de control social. Estás dispuesto/a a aceptar el trabajo que sea, a comer la mierda que haga falta...\n[#35](c35#c-35) Joder, otro cristofasfista de los cojones.\nDeberían revisar la tasa de natalidad entre primos y contabilizarla como abortos también.\n[#25](c25#c-25) Pero piensa en ello, cómo os están quitando de en medio mediante la implantación de una ideología luciferina.\n[#4](c4#c-4) Yo estoy a favor del aborto incluso en algunos casos con carácter retroactivo, hasta los 360 meses o más, que a veces no sabes si ha salido el niño mermao hasta que le salen pelos en los huevos y se tatúa una esvástica.\n[#3](c3#c-3) En las clínicas efectúan el procedimiento según la legislación vigente, las mujeres ya acuden con lo deberes morales hechos de casa, nadie va a esas clínicas a consultar si debe hacerlo como dilema moral, no es un dispensario de salud mental.\nEn una conversación ligera con una amiga hablamos sobre todo lo relacionado al aborto y las leyes, al final jocosamente, llegamos a la conclusión de que si la mujer pudiera excretar a voluntad una toxina que provocara que el miembro ardiera como el infierno al mínimo acercamiento incluso sin contacto, se acabarían la mayoría de problemas relacionados directa o indirectamente con el sexo, entre ellos el 'dilema' del aborto para algunos.",

    "title": "Illinois' Terrence Shannon Jr. suspended, faces rape charges in Kansas",
    "text": "Illinois suspended star guard Terrence Shannon Jr. on Thursday after a warrant was issued for his arrest on a rape charge. The Douglas County (Kansas) District Attorney issued the warrant for the Big Ten's second-leading scorer on Wednesday. The alleged incident occurred while Shannon was in Lawrence, Kan., to attend the Illinois-Kansas football game on Sept. 8. Shannon traveled to Lawrence and turned himself in shortly after learning of the warrant, and he posted $50,000 bond to satisfy terms of his release, his attorney said in a statement Thursday. Charging documents reveal Shannon would face a \"minimum of 147 months to a maximum of 653 months in prison and/or a fine of up to $300,000 and 36 months post-release supervision,\" if convicted. Attorney Mark P. Sutter said Shannon intends to take the case to trial. \"Since September, when these allegations surfaced, Terrence has cooperated with law enforcement throughout the investigation, declaring his innocence from the beginning,\" Sutter said in a statement. \"Now, several months later, my office learned that formal charges were filed against him yesterday in Lawrence, KS. In less than 24 hours, my client responded, and he voluntarily surrendered to local authorities for processing and release. Terrence is innocent of these charges, and he intends to take his case to trial.\" Illinois officials released a statement announcing that Shannon had been immediately suspended from all team activities. \"The University and DIA (Division of Intercollegiate Athletics) take allegations of sexual misconduct seriously while respecting due process and the presumption of innocence afforded through the legal system. \"DIA and Urbana campus officials have been aware of a Lawrence police investigation into Shannon since late September but, until Wednesday, had yet to receive actionable information. Shannon's arrest triggers the DIA student-athlete misconduct policy. Under that policy, Shannon has been immediately suspended from all team activities. Any change to Shannon's status will be communicated in a timely manner.\" Shannon is having an All-American-caliber season, averaging 21.7 points, 4.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists in 11 starts for the 11th-ranked Fighting Illini (9-2, 1-0 Big Ten). The 6-foot-6 senior from Chicago has career averages of 13.5 points and 3.9 rebounds in 125 games (95 starts) for Texas Tech (2019-22) and Illinois. --Field Level Media Originally published on [fieldlevelmedia.com](https://fieldlevelmedia.com), part of the [BLOX Digital Content Exchange](https://www.bloxdigital.com/products_services/cen/).",

    "text": "Snack-Rückruf bei Netto und Rewe: Bei Verzehr drohen Durchfall und Fieber\nDer Rückruf eines beliebten Snacks weitet sich aus. Die Produkte von Netto und Rewe in mindestens acht Bundesländern sind derzeit betroffen.\nUpdate vom 2. Juli 2025: Der Pistazien-Rückruf weitet sich aus – auch das Produkt eines weiteren Supermarkts ist betroffen. Auch die Pistazien der Rewe-Marke „ja!“ werden jetzt wegen Salmonellenbefall zurückgerufen. Der Hersteller ist ebenfalls Ireco Trading & Production S.A. In einer Pressemitteilung heißt es dazu: „Eine Gesundheitsgefährdung kann nicht mit abschließender Sicherheit ausgeschlossen werden.“ Betroffen ist das folgende Produkt:\nProdukt | Ja! Pistazien geröstet & gesalzen, 250 g |\n---|---|\nMDH | 11.03.2026 |\nEAN | 4337256158633 |\nKäufer des betroffenen Produktes können die Pistazien bei Rewe auch ohne Vorlage eines Kassenbelegs zurückgeben.\nErstmeldung vom 1. Juli 2025: Kassel – Was als gemütlicher Fernsehabend mit einer Tüte Pistazien beginnt, könnte für Verbraucher in acht Bundesländern böse enden. Denn der Hersteller Ireco Trading & Production S.A. ruft „Clarkys“ Pistazien zurück, wie das Warnportal des Bundes, lebensmittelwarnung.de, bekanntgibt.\nRückruf bei Netto: Pistazien betroffen\nDas Produkt wurde in Filialen von Netto Marken-Discount verkauft. Kundinnen und Kunden, die das entsprechende Produkt mit der Chargennummer 7596 und dem Mindesthaltbarkeitsdatum 10.03.2026 gekauft haben, sollten es nicht verzehren. Das Produkt kann gegen Erstattung des Kaufpreises auch ohne Vorlage des Kassenbons in den Einkaufsstätten zurückgegeben werden. Das Produkt wurde in acht Bundesländern bei Netto verkauft.\nBetroffene Bundesländer:\n- Baden-Württemberg\n- Bayern\n- Bremen\n- Hessen\n- Niedersachsen\n- Nordrhein-Westfalen\n- Sachsen-Anhalt\n- Thüringen\nVerbraucheranfragen beantwortet der Kundenservice unter der 0800 200 0015 (Montag bis Samstag von 6 Uhr bis 22.30 Uhr). Eine Mitarbeiterin bei Netto zeigte zuletzt, warum sie den Discounter besser findet als Aldi oder Lidl.\nDie Daten des Rückrufs in der Übersicht:\nProdukt | „Clarkys“ Pistazien geröstet |\n---|---|\nHersteller | Ireco Trading & Production S.A |\nVerpackungsgröße | 250 Gramm |\nBetroffene Chargen | 7596 |\nMindesthaltbarkeitsdatum | 10.03.2026 |\nSnack-Rückruf: Salmonellen-Gefahr bei Pistazien von Netto\nAuf der Website des Discounters informiert der Hersteller über den Hintergrund des Rückrufs: Der beliebte Knabbersnack könnte mit Salmonellen belastet sein – Bakterien, die zu tagelangem Durchfall, heftigem Erbrechen und Fieber führen können.\nBei Netto heißt es: „Es kann nicht ausgeschlossen werden, dass einzelne Packungen mit der aufgeführten Chargennummer des betroffenen Artikels Pistazien geröstet (250 g) der Marke ‚Clarkys‘ mit Salmonellen belastet sind. Ein Verzehr könnte zu gesundheitlichen Beeinträchtigungen führen.“ Es wurde daher umgehend reagiert und die Ware sofort aus dem Verkauf genommen.\nDer Hersteller weist in seiner Mitteilung daraufhin, dass weitere Chargennummern, Mindesthaltbarkeitsdaten oder andere Produkte der Marke „Clarkys“ nicht betroffen sind.\nPistazien-Rückruf: Gesundheitsgefahr droht vor allem für bestimmte Personengruppen\nBei einer Salmonellen-Infektion handelt es sich um eine Magen-Darm-Infektion durch Bakterien, wie gesund.bund.de informiert. Typischerweise treten als Symptome Durchfall, Bauchschmerzen, Erbrechen und Fieber auf. Meistens verschwinden die Beschwerden nach einigen Tagen von allein, doch besonders Säuglinge, Kleinkinder, Senioren und Menschen mit geschwächtem Immunsystem sind gefährdet, schwerere Krankheitsverläufe zu entwickeln. Bei schweren oder anhaltenden Symptomen sollten Betroffene unbedingt ärztliche Hilfe aufsuchen und auf eine mögliche Salmonellen-Infektion hinweisen.\nSalmonellen-Infektionen sind in Deutschland meldepflichtig und unterliegen dem Infektionsschutzgesetz. Bereits der Verdacht auf eine Salmonellose muss von Ärzten innerhalb von 24 Stunden an das zuständige Gesundheitsamt gemeldet werden, insbesondere wenn Betroffene im Lebensmittelbereich arbeiten oder mehrere Personen gleichzeitig erkrankt sind, so internisten-im-netz.de.\nAuch ein Tiefkühl-Produkt von Penny befindet sich derzeit in einem Rückruf. Bei einem Frucht-Produkt von Edeka drohen bei Verzehr gar innere Blutungen. (jh)",
