    "title": "Community Furious After Tennessee School Allows “After School Satan Club”",
    "text": "A Tennessee school is facing criticism after it revealed plans to permit an “After School Satan Club” to use its building starting January 10th. The club is run by\nThe Satanic Temple (TST), which promotes the club as a program that “focuses on science, critical thinking, creative arts, and good works for the community.” The club states that proselytization is not its goal and seeks to “provide a safe and inclusive alternative to the religious clubs that use threats of eternal damnation to convert school children to their belief system.” TST states it does not start a club at a school unless the school is also in use by religious afterschool programs, such as The Good News Club.\nParents of students at Chimneyrock Elementary School in Cordova were alarmed to receive notices about the club starting and contacted officials at Memphis-Shelby County Schools (MSCS), which oversees Chimneyrock. According to TST, they were contacted by parents within the school that were interested in starting a club. Including Tennessee, there will be five states running After School Satan Clubs. At a meeting to address parent concerns, interim school superintendent Toni Williams said permitting the club to host meetings at the school’s library was a matter of law. “I want to assure you that I do not endorse, I do not support the beliefs of this organization at the center of the recent headlines. I do, however, support the law. As a superintendent, I am duty-bound to uphold our board policy, state laws and the Constitution,” she\nsaid. Attendance at the club is not mandatory for students, nor is it being sponsored by the district. Williams encouraged critics to seek a middle ground. “I challenge you not to push away in fear but to push in with support. We can support the First Amendment and our students at the same time.”\nSpeaking to\nFox News, father Reggie Clark didn’t mince words. “I can’t say that I was shocked because I wasn’t shocked. [They] have already taken God out of school and prayer out of school and they invited the devil in,” he said. He criticized the district’s decision to allow the club. “They failed the community. They failed our children because, again, they [would] rather dodge a lawsuit than actually protect our children.” He also did not buy into TST’s claims of not forcing proselytization. “If you want to exercise the First Amendment right, do like any other proper 501(c)(3). You go to your building and give people a choice to. But when you are forcing and demanding yourself in a school system, especially with our children, we’re talking about babies, five through nine years old. You’re forcing yourself into the school… that’s what I have an issue with.” Another member of the community, Rev. Bill Adkins, pastor of Greater Imani Church, called the situation “absurd.” “We cannot allow any entity called Satanic Temple to have private time with our children. I can’t go into the school building and pray. But yet we can rent a facility to the Satanic Temple, and they can give a party for children. It’s ridiculous. It’s absurd.”",

(WSFA) - The Heart of Alabama Food Bank announced Wednesday that it’s started three new programs to help thousands of people across the state.\nMichael Coleman, the CEO of the food bank, says they are focusing on rural counties since they have the fewest resources.\nThe programs introduced include:\nFood as Medicine - This program provides medically tailored meals, produce, and other resources to help sick individuals access and afford healthy food.\nHeroes Harvest - This program gives meals to active-duty military families. They will get two food deliveries a month for up to six months.\nMobile Market - This program will allow the food bank to carry up to 6,000 pounds of fresh produce, dairy, and other refrigerated foods. It will go to set locations in rural areas that don’t have grocery store access.\nThe Heart of Alabama Food Bank is also working with the Montgomery Cancer Center, Jackson Hospital, and the Kidney Foundation.\nThey are already receiving referrals for cancer patients who are food insecure, and food bank officials say they are delivering 40 pounds of fresh produce, protein, and shelf stable food to their doorsteps.\nThe Heart of Alabama Food Bank serves 35 of Alabama’s 67 counties.\nNot reading this story on the WSFA News App?

    "text": "Sports\nVictor Wembanyama’s Season-Ending Injury Gets Unique Chris Bosh Update\nVictor Wembanyama's season is officially over, as the San Antonio Spurs announced that he is dealing with a worrisome blood clot issue in his right shoulder. Immediately after this news came out, fans everywhere thought of the legendary Chris Bosh, whose career was largely derailed due to his own issues with blood clots.\nThe official diagnosis for Wembanyama's injury is deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, which is the same ailment Bosh dealt with towards the end of his career. According to ESPN's Shams Charania, the ailment began to impact Wembanyama during the All-Star festivities in San Francisco, California.\n\"I'm told that Victor Wembanyama had started to feel symptomatic, and he went into the post All-Star break, Monday, Tuesday, taking time for himself, taking down time, and hoped to feel better. But, he did not. He was still feeling symptomatic from my understanding,\" Charania said on \"NBA Today.\"\nBosh dealt with recurring blood clots in his legs that ultimately forced him out of the NBA. The fear, given that Wembanyama's ailment is the exact same as Bosh's, was that he would suffer a similar fate as the legendary big man. However, reports have indicated that Wembanyama's case is not as severe as Bosh's was.\n\"To address some understandable concerns: Spurs are optimistic Wembanyama will recover in time for next season. Not worried about his long-term health. I'm told this is not as serious as the Chris Bosh blood clot issue,\" Mike Finger of the San Antonio Express-News reported in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n— Mike Finger (@mikefinger)[February 20, 2025]\nWembanyama's second season in the NBA saw him finish with averages of 24.3 points, 11 rebounds, and 3.7 rebounds per game on 47.6% shooting from the field. He also was leading the league in blocks per game with 3.8, which made him the frontrunner to win the Defensive Player of the Year award.\nThat won't be possible now that Wembanyama won't play in the minimum 60-game threshold to qualify for the award, though. The main concern is Wembanayama's health now, and all eyes will be on him to see if he can find his way back on the court next season.\nRelated: NBA Insider's Concerning Revelation About Victor Wembanyama's Season-Ending Injury\nCopyright 2025 Athlon Sports.
