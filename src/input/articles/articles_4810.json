    "text": "Corriere Tv / CorriereTv Si è concluso il primo giugno con la messa in Duomo (celebrata dal vescovo, monsignor Pierantonio Tremolada) e la sfilata in centro storico il 28esimo raduno nazionale dell’Associazione Vigili del fuoco organizzato a Brescia. I soci dell’ANVVF-CN, i vigili del fuoco presenti e il personale delle associazioni di volontariato, all’uscita dal Duomo, con i veicoli storici e attuali del Vigili del Fuoco, si sono incolonnati in corteo fino a piazza del Mercato dove si è svolta la cerimonia finale con l'alzabandiera e i ringraziamenti della sindaca di Brescia, onorata di aver ospitato questo evento. Nel corteo era presente anche una rappresentativa dell’Inicef, del mini pompieri e colleghi di New York e di Lugano. Al termine i Vigili del Fuoco di New York sono saliti sul palco ed hanno consegnato due presenti all’ANVVF-CN: una voce con incisa la data dell’11 settembre con le iniziali del World Trade Center ed un casco con sopra riportato il numero dei colleghi deceduti a seguito del crollo delle torri gemelle.

    "text": "The lowest temperature of this winter season was recorded today (13 December) in Tetulia, Panchagarh, with mercury dropping to 8.4°C. Earlier, the lowest temperature in the country was recorded in Gopalganj and Chuadanga at 10.2°C yesterday. In Tetulia, the lowest temperature yesterday was 12.6°C and the highest temperature of the upazila was 24.8 at around 3pm. According to meteorologists, it can be said a mild cold wave is blowing over an area if the minimum temperature of the day in an area is between 8°C and 10°C. A mild cold wave is sweeping through the northern and western regions, with districts such as Panchagarh, Rajshahi, and Chuadanga experiencing the chill. This cold wave is expected to persist for the time being, according to Bangladesh Meteorological Department's latest weather bulletin today (13 December). Panchagarh Deputy Commissioner Md Sabet Ali told Prothom Alo that the government has already allocated Tk15 lakh to buy 2,000 blankets and winter clothes for the cold-stricken people of Panchagarh. Distribution process of these have started. Apart from this, various organisations have already distributed about 10,000 blankets in different areas of the district privately, he added. Meanwhile, winter has also arrived in Dhaka as well. City dwellers are greeted with a shroud of fog in the early morning with cool breeze blowing throughout the day. Over the next few days, the weather across Bangladesh is expected to remain mostly dry with a temporary partly cloudy sky, according to the met office bulletin. Both night and day temperatures are expected to fall slightly across the country, reports the met office. With the onset of winter, fog has already started disrupting services like flights and ferries across the country due to low visibility. Today's met office bulletin states that moderate to thick fog may occur at places over the country from midnight till noon.",

    "text": "By Nidal al-Mughrabi and Bassam Masoud\nCAIRO/GAZA (Reuters) – Israeli forces attacked areas of the central and southern Gaza Strip where residents have been expecting a renewed ground offensive in areas crammed with tens of thousands of Palestinians already displaced by the Israeli-Hamas war.\nWith nightfall on Thursday, an Israeli airstrike on a house in the southern city of Khan Younis killed eight Palestinians, health officials said. Three Palestinians were killed and six injured in an Israeli missile strike on a house in Maghazi camp in central Gaza, the Palestine Red Crescent said.\n“The task here is to dismantle Hamas – so that it no longer has military and governing capabilities,” Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said at a press briefing on operations in Khan Younis. “We will be required to show a lot of perseverance and determination.”\nA Palestinian journalist posted pictures of Israeli tanks near a mosque in a built-up area of Bureij in central Gaza.\nThe Islamist group Hamas released video it said showed its fighters targeting Israeli tanks and soldiers east of Bureij. Reuters was not able to verify the location or the date the video was filmed.\n“That moment has come, I wished it would never happen, but it seems displacement is a must,” said Omar, 60, who said he had been forced to move with at least 35 family members. He declined to give his surname for fear of reprisals.\nYamen Hamad has been living in a school in Deir al-Balah, also in central Gaza, since fleeing from the north. He said people newly displaced from Bureij and Nusseirat were setting up tents wherever there was open ground.\nIn one of Israel’s latest airstrikes, 20 Palestinians were killed and 55 wounded in Rafah, a major town near the southern border with Egypt, Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said. Their bombed building was housing displaced civilians, according to local medics and residents.\nSEARCHING THROUGH RUBBLE\nReuters video showed rescuers scrabbling frantically through rubble to uncover and pull out victims including a baby and several children and rushing them through milling crowds of dazed and weeping people to the nearby Kuwaiti Hospital.\nPalestinian health authorities said earlier that 210 people were confirmed killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, raising the toll of Palestinians killed in the war so far to 21,320 – nearly 1% of Gaza’s population. Thousands more dead were feared to be buried or lost in the ruins.\nOver the course of the war, the Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but it accuses Hamas of operating in densely populated areas and using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies.\nHamas and its fighters are dug deep into the Gaza Strip’s dense cities and towns and their leaders are still at large.\nIsrael has reported 169 of its soldiers killed in its Gaza campaign after Hamas fighters rampaged through Israeli towns in a cross-border raid on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages.\nSome 110 hostages were freed during a Nov. 24-Dec. 1 humanitarian pause and more than 20 others have been declared dead.\nU.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that Hamas killed an American hostage, Judith Weinstein, 70, on Oct. 7. Last week he said her husband Gadi Haggai, 73, was killed on the same day.\nThe Israeli military released findings of an investigation into the killings in error by its troops of three Israeli hostages in Gaza on Dec. 15. Soldiers mistook their cries for help as a ruse by Hamas militants to draw them into an ambush, the military said, concluding that the soldiers acted rightly to the best of their understanding.\nEGYPT’S PLAN TO END CONFLICT\nEgypt confirmed on Thursday that it had put forward a framework proposal to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip that includes three stages ending with a ceasefire and said it was awaiting responses on the plan.\nThe proposal is an attempt “to bring viewpoints between all concerned parties closer, in an effort to stop Palestinian bloodshed and the aggression against the Gaza Strip and restore peace and stability to the region,” Diaa Rashwan, head of Egypt’s State Information Service, said in a statement.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will keep some form of security control of all Gaza indefinitely, though he insists that this would not amount to reoccupying the enclave.\n(Reporting by Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Cairo, Bassam Masoud in Gaza and Emily Rose in Jerusalem; writing by Grant McCool; editing by Howard Goller)",
