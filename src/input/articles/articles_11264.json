    "text": "When it comes to weathering the weather, Iowa is tops.\nSo says CNBC in a piece assessing which states are best prepared.\n(Georgia did not make the list ).\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution sent a team of journalists to the Hawkeye State last week for caucus coverage and as their dispatches illustrate, the weather - with its snur-icane force winds, was definitely something.\nThat’s a wrap, Iowa! Thank you for the snur-icane force winds and Iowa Nice. Next up: New Hampshuh. pic.twitter.com/WMUs9xixrO\n— Patricia Murphy (@MurphyAJC) January 16, 2024 Explore Georgians brave weather for Iowa caucuses But unlike metro Atlanta, where schools and government offices were closed or delayed ahead of what has mostly turned out to be frigid temps so far, Iowa doesn’t shut down when winter is coming.\nHere’s a wrap of our team’s hot cold takes:\nTia Mitchell:\n“Iowa experienced a one-two winter weather punch last week that resulted in more snow that many areas had experienced in over a half-century. That was followed by subzero temperatures and dangerous wind chills that lasted for days. It was so cold that normal remedies like salting roads were less effective. That is why it’s so impressive to me how well the state navigated the storm.”\nI arrived in Iowa yesterday. Here is some video I shot at the airport. pic.twitter.com/x1taTNHTBF\n— Tia Mitchell, AJC’s Washington Correspondent (@ajconwashington) January 14, 2024 When I landed at Des Moines Airport on Saturday, the winds were blowing snow all over the place. But the airport was functioning well; I don’t know how those people got to work. As I drove a few miles into downtown Des Moines, only one road on my route was deemed impassable. The rest were frozen over and snow packed, but the few people who ventured out were able to get where they needed to go. By Sunday, my first day hitting the Des Moines highways, I found clear lanes of travel. I don’t know how they did it: I guess some high tech solutions with super low freezing levels. The interstates near Des Moines had at least two travel lanes that were essentially dry. Yes, there was snow piled up on emergency lanes and the occasional slick spots. But the fact that just days after the storm the highways were clear was amazing to me. Finally, it was clear the people of Iowa are used to this. I know I frustrated some drivers as I crept along at an out-of-towner’s pace on the snowy streets, because at their first opportunity many sped around me. But unlike them, I wasn’t used to driving in these conditions!\nJust recorded this video in Clive, Iowa, where @RepMcCormick was knocking on doors for Gov. Ron DeSantis. The cold was starting to get to me, yall, so I was losing my train of thought! pic.twitter.com/DQI5yaqrMR\n— Tia Mitchell, AJC’s Washington Correspondent (@ajconwashington) January 14, 2024 There were lots of pickup trucks and four-wheel drive vehicles on the road. There were lots of trucks with snow plows on the front. Monday evening, as I left a precinct where I observed caucus speeches, I walked back to my rental car parked in a nearby neighborhood. It was about 7:30 p.m. local time, and a homeowner had pulled out his snow blower to clear off his driveway. It was the same type of machine I had seen throughout the week, making sidewalks navigable. Yes, even Iowans said the storm and the freezing temperatures were rare. But not one of them told me they were unprepared.\nPatricia Murphy:\nTemperatures of -6 to -9 below zero made Monday night the coldest Iowa caucuses on record. The frigid temperatures continued to make travel treacherous in parts of the state as Iowans headed out to caucus.”\nIt’s time for your Sunday afternoon weather report from the Iowa caucuses, where my hair has literally frozen solid. 🥶❄️🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/adSpFQwJmG\n— Patricia Murphy (@MurphyAJC) January 14, 2024 Dozens of tractor trailers remained abandoned on the sides of I-80 east of Des Moines, days after a blizzard made the interstate all but impassable, and ice-coated streets and sidewalks proved too difficult to navigate for some trying to get to caucus locations. Turnout for the first-in-the-nation contest the lowest in more than a decade.\nHyosub Shin\nIt was the coldest weather I have ever experienced in my life. As long as I didn’t have to stay outside for more than 10 minutes, I was OK. I brought three down puffy jackets. When I had to stay outside, I had to wear at least two.\nThey were actually great at dealing with snow. The one thing I was really amazed at is, incredibly, I didn’t see a single accident. They know how to drive. The snow was pretty bad but it didn’t take too long to clean up. They handle snow really, really well. I was really impressed.\nCredit: Hyosub Shin\nCredit: Hyosub Shin",

    "text": "„Geniestreich“: Bonmatí kannte Bergers Schwäche\nSpaniens Siegtorschützin Aitana Bonmatí verrät, wie sie Deutschlands Torhüterin Ann-Katrin Berger im EM-Halbfinale ausgetrickst hat. Und was sie unbedingt verhindern wollte.\nZürich - Spaniens Siegtorschützin Aitana Bonmatí hat Ann-Katrin Berger schon vor dem EM-Halbfinale ausgeguckt. „Die Wahrheit ist, dass wir mit dem Trainerstab, mit den Analysten, mit dem Torwarttrainer die Torhüterin gut studiert hatten. Wir wussten, dass sie in dieser Situation manchmal den kurzen Pfosten frei lässt“, erklärte die zweimalige Weltfußballerin ihr Tor zum 1:0-Erfolg nach Verlängerung gegen Deutschland in Zürich.\nBonmatí hatte Berger mit einem Schuss aus spitzem Winkel ins kurze Eck genarrt und damit die Weltmeisterinnen von 2023 erstmals in ein EM-Finale geführt. „Ich habe nicht zweimal darüber nachgedacht“, erklärte die Mittelfeldspielerin die entscheidende Szene in der 113. Spielminute. „Ich habe alles versucht, weil ich keine Elfmeter schießen wollte.“ Beim 2:0 im Viertelfinale hatten die Spanierinnen gleich zwei Strafstöße gegen die Schweiz vergeben.\nAls „Geniestreich“ lobte Bundestrainer Christian Wück das Tor in der ARD. „Ich schoss mit allem, was ich hatte, mit aller Kraft“, berichtete die 27 Jahre alte Weltklassespielerin des FC Barcelona. „Ein Tor zu schießen in einem Spiel wie diesem ist etwas ganz Besonders.“ Schon gegen die Schweiz war Bonmatí nach einer zauberhaften Vorlage per Hackentrick zur Spielerin des Spiels gekürt worden, gegen das DFB-Team gab sie erneut den Takt an.\nTrainerin Tomé über Bonmatí: „Sehr spezielle Persönlichkeit“\nKurz vor der EM hatte Bonmatí nach einer Hirnhautentzündung noch um ihre Teilnahme in der Schweiz bangen müssen. „Das war nicht einfach für sie am Anfang des Turniers“, berichtete Trainerin Montse Tomé. Bonmatí sei aber „eine sehr spezielle Persönlichkeit, sie will ganz weit oben sein. Sie hat es geschafft, ihre Gesundheitsprobleme zu überwinden.“\nNeben dem Einzug ins Finale gelang Tomés Elf im neunten Duell mit dem DFB-Team der erste Sieg. „Heute habe ich das Gefühl, dass wir wieder Geschichte geschrieben haben“, sagte Bonmatí. „Ich bin also stolz darauf, zu dieser Generation von Fußballerinnen zu gehören, die so viel erreicht haben.“\nDer nächste große Titel nach dem WM-Triumph in Australien winkt am kommenden Sonntag (18.00 Uhr/ZDF und DAZN). Im Baseler St. Jakob-Park trifft Spanien auf Titelverteidiger und Vizeweltmeister England. dpa",

    "text": "your parents offering to pay you for your time is an insult and have no respect for you at all your parents offering to pay you is an insult and have no respect for you I Was Never the Favorite Child — Now I Refuse to Help My Parents After They Gave My Sister a House [Family & kids](/topics/inspiration-family-and-kids/) Today’s story dives into the pain of being overlooked and the difficult decision to set boundaries when the scales of parental favoritism tip too far. With raw honesty and introspection, the author confronts the challenging choice to protect their own well-being, even when it means refusing to support the very people who once failed to support them. He [explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1f17gqw/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_parents_after_they/) what happened. I (33M) have always had a complicated relationship with my parents. Growing up, my younger sister, Lily (30F), was clearly the favorite. They were more lenient with her, gave her more opportunities, and supported her financially in ways they never did for me. I accepted it over the years, figuring it was just the way things were. A few months ago, my parents decided to downsize and move into a smaller home. Instead of selling their current house, which is the one we grew up in, they decided to give it to Lily. They said she “needed it more” because she’s starting a [family](/tags/family/) and could use the space. They didn’t offer me anything—not even a conversation about it. This hit me hard, especially since my wife and I are also planning to buy a home soon, and we could’ve really used some help. When I brought this up to my parents, they brushed it off and said Lily has always been the one who “needed” more support. I told them I felt hurt and left out, but they just acted like I was being selfish. Fast-forward to last week: my parents reached out asking if I could help them with some renovations on their new place. They want me to spend several weekends doing repairs and helping them move, all without any compensation or even acknowledgment of how unfair this situation feels to me. I told them no, that I was not willing to help after the way they handled giving away the house. They were shocked and accused me of being petty and ungrateful. Lily also chimed in, saying I’m causing unnecessary drama and making everything about me. Now, my parents are barely speaking to me, and some extended family members have reached out, telling me I’m overreacting and that I should just help them out because \"family comes first.\" People stood on his side. - “I love when family who treat you like an afterthought think that ignoring you is some kind of punishment and not the actual gift that it is. Tell everyone who gives you that ‘family comes first’ line that you’re happy to let your parents know that they’re willing to help them out instead. See how fast they drop the ‘family comes first’ line then.” [TheSassiestPanda / Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1f17gqw/comment/ljx7hpi/) - “Lily feels that way because she’s the only person who benefited from their completely one-sided gift. Then going low contact is truly going to be what’s best right now for your mental health. You owe them nothing. Lily can help now that she doesn’t have to pay a mortgage payment.” [United-Manner20 / Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1f17gqw/comment/ljxadqp/) - “Tell them to have your sister help them out. They should fix it right, being she is the golden child. Move on with your wife and leave them behind because it’s all toxic and no need to have her in your life. Have peace, create a new family with your wife and enjoy your life.” [Upset_Structure3547 / Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1f17gqw/comment/ljxf8bg/) He then talked to his parents. Unfortunately, the conversation didn’t go as I’d hoped. My parents were immediately defensive. My mom insisted that they had every right to do what they wanted with their property and that I should be more understanding of Lily’s needs. My dad doubled down, saying that they were just doing what was best for the family and that I was being selfish for making this about myself. They refused to acknowledge any favoritism or the impact their decision had on me. As for Lily, when I confronted her, she basically dismissed my feelings. She told me she didn’t see what the big deal was and accused me of trying to stir up drama. She said that if the roles were reversed, she wouldn’t be upset and implied that I was overreacting. I tried to explain how it felt to be overlooked for so long, but she just shrugged it off and told me to move on. At this point, I’ve decided to step back. I’ve agreed to help my parents with the renovations because I don’t want to burn bridges completely, but I made it clear that this doesn’t mean I’m okay with how they handled things. They offered to pay me for my time, but honestly, it feels like a way to brush off the real issues. I’m not sure if our relationship will ever fully recover, but I’m focusing on setting boundaries and prioritizing my own well-being. The author’s journey from hurt and resentment to self-empowerment highlights the importance of setting boundaries and prioritizing one’s own emotional health. By choosing not to help their parents after a lifetime of [feeling undervalued](https://brightside.me/articles/why-having-a-favorite-child-isnt-actually-a-bad-thing-806587/), the author reclaims their sense of worth, underscoring the necessity of self-respect in the face of deeply ingrained family dynamics. This decision, though difficult, represents a crucial step toward healing and personal growth.

    "text": "MADRID- Begoña Gómez, la esposa del presidente del Gobierno español Pedro Sánchez , ahora en el centro de la atención mediática desde el anuncio de la apertura de una investigación judicial en su contra, había acompañado la carrera de su marido de manera discreta pero mostrándole complicidad.\n\"Somos un equipo, como equipo remamos juntos\", aseguró en 2016 esta mujer de larga cabellera rubia en una televisora.\nLee además POLÉMICA España: PP exige a Pedro Sánchez sacar de la opacidad el caso Delcygate y dar explicaciones ESPAÑA Pedro Sánchez sopesa dimitir por acusaciones de corrupción contra su esposa La justicia española, anunció el miércoles que se la investigaba por \" corrupción y tráfico de influencias\", a raíz de una denuncia presentada por una organización opositora.\n\"Denuncian a Begoña no porque haya hecho algo ilegal, ellos saben que no hay caso, sino por ser mi esposa\", afirmó Pedro Sánchez en la carta en la que se dio hasta el lunes para \"reflexionar\" sobre su dimisión.\n\"Muchas veces se nos olvida que tras los políticos hay personas. Y yo, no me causa rubor decirlo, soy un hombre profundamente enamorado de mi mujer que vive con impotencia el fango que sobre ella esparcen día sí y día también\", añadió Sánchez.\nCaptación de fondos Nacida en 1975 en Bilbao, en el País Vasco (norte), Begoña Gómez es objeto de esta investigación por los vínculos que estableció, en el ejercicio de su profesión, con empresas que negociaban ayudas públicas o participaban en concursos públicos.\nSegún el medio digital El Confidencial, Gómez \"se reunió en privado\" con el consejero delegado del Grupo Globalia, propietario de la aerolínea Air Europa, cuando ésta negociaba un plan de rescate con el Gobierno de Sánchez.\nEn aquel momento, Gómez dirigía IE Africa Center, fundación vinculada a la escuela de negocios madrileña IE University, que, según El Confidencial, había firmado un acuerdo de patrocinio con Globalia en 2020. Dejó este cargo en 2022.\nLa esposa de Pedro Sánchez es licenciada en Marketing por la universidad privada madrileña ESIC y tiene un máster en Dirección de Empresas. A lo largo de los años, se ha especializado en la captación de fondos, sobre todo para fundaciones y ONG.\nSu carrera la ha llevado a ocupar diversos puestos de responsabilidad, como en Inmark Europa, una consultora empresarial, y en un departamento de la Universidad Complutense de Madrid.\nUna carrera que esta activista de oficialistas, regularmente al frente de las manifestaciones del Día de los Derechos de la Mujer, el 8 de marzo, no quiso abandonar tras la llegada de su marido a la jefatura del gobierno en 2018.\nRelación sentimental Pareja desde principios de los 2000 de Pedro Sánchez, al que conoció en la fiesta de cumpleaños de un amigo común, Begoña Gómez acompañó el ascenso político de su marido esforzándose en no exponerse demasiado en los medios.\nEn España, una monarquía parlamentaria en la que el rey es el jefe de Estado, no existe un rango protocolario para los cónyuges de los jefes de gobierno. Esto permite una relativa discreción.\nSin embargo, esta reserva no impide a la pareja, padres de dos hijas adolescentes (Ainhoa y Carlota), aparecer juntos en las noches electorales.\n\"Gracias a ella, soy mas vitalista\", confió hace unos años el dirigente socialista.\nAl igual que Brigitte Macron en Francia y Michele Obama en Estados Unidos, Begoña Gómez ha sido víctima de \"fake news\" en las redes sociales que insinuaban que era un hombre.\nFUENTE: AFP",

    "text": "By Aditi Rathi ,\n1 days ago\nCalifornia is facing another widespread fire which has been named the Malibu Fire or Franklin Fire. The flames began at about 10:50 pm on Monday at about ten acres. However, with time, it has spread to more than 2,800 acres as of Tuesday. Several areas around the celebrity-studded city have been engulfed in fire.\n​\nThe areas affected by the fire , according to the map provided by the Los Angeles County Fire Department's website are east of Malibu Canyon Road, Serra Retreat area, and the south of Piuma Road. Authorities have issued mandatory evacuation in these areas as the fire is spreading rapidly with 7% containment.\nTens of thousands of people are facing power cuts since Monday night. The strong gusts of winds from Santa Monica can damage all electrical equipment which can result in being the cause of a wildfire .\n​\nAs of Tuesday night, about seven structures have been destroyed, while eight have been damaged.\nAccording to CBS, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna shared updates on evacuation in Malibu on Wednesday morning. Luna shared that the areas north of Pacific Coast Highway, south of Mulholland Highway, east of Trancas, and west of Crestline have been given evacuation warnings.\nThis means that the residents of these areas need to remain ready to evacuate at any time.\n​\nOn the other hand, areas east of Corral Canyon, south of Piuma Road, and west of Big Rock are under evacuation orders.\nA spokesperson for Malibu city named Matt Myerhoff also shared details about the evacuation process.\n​\n\"The way evacuations are conducted by the Sheriff's department is they go door to door. They drive up and down the streets with a blowhorn and they knock on every single door. They wake people up and get them out of their houses.\" ​\nDue to the spreading Malibu fire, several roads have also been closed to keep people safe. The Pacific Coast Highway between Kanan Dume Road and Tuna Canyon Road has been closed. PCH eastbound, Malibu Canyon Road, and Topanga Canyon Boulevard are also closed.\nEvacuation warnings have been issued in the areas west of Topanga Canyon Boulevard, east of Kanan Dune Road and Trancas Canyon Road, and south of Mulholland Highway.\n​",

    "text": "In an age where digital transformation is reshaping every sector, the Rajasthan Skill and Livelihoods Development Corporation (RSLDC) stands at the forefront of revolutionizing skill development governance. Aligned with the vision of Digital Rajasthan and the principles of good governance, RSLDC has implemented two innovative digital initiatives: Kaushal Darpan and the Integrated Scheme Management System (ISMS). These initiatives are transforming how government skill development schemes are monitored, managed, and executed, showcasing the state’s commitment to transparency, accountability, real-time monitoring, and datadriven decision-making in public service delivery.\nKaushal Darpan: Real-Time Monitoring for Transparent Skill Development\nKaushal Darpan serves as a digital monitoring platform designed to enhance transparency and efficiency in the operations of Skill Development Centres (SDCs). By incorporating advanced technologies such as IP camera-based face recognition systems, the platform provides live surveillance of training centres, safeguarding against fraudulent practices and ensuring the quality of training programs.\nThe implementation strategy of Kaushal Darpan is multifaceted. IP cameras installed at SDCs deliver live feeds that are monitored by a dedicated team at the RSLDC headquarters in Jaipur. This live stream is accessible to the public through the RSLDC website portal, promoting transparency. The real-time attendance monitoring system utilizes face recognition technology, motion detection, and a two-way communication facility to prevent attendance manipulation and ensure compliance with program standards. Furthermore, daily observations submitted via the platform facilitate prompt feedback and necessary adjustments.\nThe benefits of Kaushal Darpan are far-reaching. It promotes transparency by ensuring authentic trainee attendance through real-time facial recognition, thereby reducing the scope for proxy attendance or misreporting. Operational efficiency is greatly improved by minimizing dependence on manual processes, while accessibility is enhanced through the public availability of live monitoring feeds. Additionally, the system strengthens accountability by enabling swift corrective actions whenever discrepancies in training delivery or compliance are observed. As a result, Kaushal Darpan has fostered a culture of discipline, integrity, and performance across the skill development ecosystem—ensuring that government initiatives truly reach and benefit the youth of Rajasthan.\nIntegrated Scheme Management System (ISMS)\nThe Integrated Scheme Management System (ISMS) represents RSLDC’s comprehensive approach to digitizing all processes related to the implementation of skill development schemes in the state. It addresses common challenges faced in manual environments, including delays, poor coordination, inefficient record-keeping, and limited transparency.\nISMS is structured into five functional modules: Expression of Interest (EoI) Management, Registration & Training Management, Assessment & Certification, Placement Verification, and Financial & Payment Management. This cohesive framework provides a single digital interface for youth, training partners, government departments, and certification agencies.\nThe platform’s functional highlights include online trainee registration and attendance monitoring, seamless management of assessments and certifications, real-time tracking of placements and post-training verifications, and financial disbursements that ensure complete transparency. The operational efficiencies gained through ISMS are remarkable. The system currently holds data of over 8 lakh youth, with more than 15,000 youth presently undergoing skill training across 250+ skill development centers. It significantly reduces paperwork and manual effort, accelerates approval processes, and improves coordination among stakeholders. Moreover, the system facilitates real-time governance through dashboards and Management Information System (MIS) reports, which empower data-driven interventions. By enhancing transparency and accountability, ISMS fosters greater public trust and improves service delivery in the skill development initiatives of Rajasthan.\nAlso Read :- e-AUSHADHI revolutionises Drug Supply Chains and empowered Public Healthcare\nVision for the Future: ISMS 2.0\nBuilding on the initial success of ISMS, RSLDC envisions a robust upgrade—ISMS 2.0—leveraging modern technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Data Analytics, and Smart Dashboards. Key features planned for this upgrade include:\n- Integration of Kaushal Darpan to provide unified monitoring\n- An Aadhaar-based facial attendance system for trainee authentication\n- E-assessments and centralized certification systems\n- Advanced analytics for predictive insights and impact evaluation\n- Seamless integration with state and central welfare schemes to ensure maximum benefit convergence for unemployed youth\nKaushal Darpan serves as a digital monitoring platform designed to enhance transparency and efficiency in the operations of Skill Development Centres (SDCs). By incorporating advanced technologies such as IP camerabased face recognition systems, the platform provides live surveillance of training centres, safeguarding against fraudulent practices and ensuring the quality of training programs.\nConclusion\nThe initiatives of Kaushal Darpan and ISMS have established a new standard for utilizing technology in public service governance. These systems not only enhance transparency and accountability but also significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of skill development program delivery. By harnessing the power of real-time data and developing citizencentric interfaces, RSLDC is committed to ensuring that no youth is left behind in their journey towards self-reliance and empowerment.
