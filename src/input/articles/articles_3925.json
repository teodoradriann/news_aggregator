    "text": "Civic Hive, a civic tech organisation, says the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) should investigate the irregularities witnessed during the September 21 governorship election in Edo state. The organisation said it “uncovered widespread flagrant anomalies by INEC officials” in the conduct of the governorship election. INEC had declared Monday Okpebholo, candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), as winner of the poll with 291,667 votes. Asue Ighodalo of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) came second with 247,274 votes. The PDP and Ighodalo rejected the outcome of the election, citing electoral irregularities, and had approached the election tribunal. Advertisement Speaking at a press conference in Lagos on Thursday, Joseph Amenaghawon, team lead of Civic Hive, said the organisation analysed results uploaded on the INEC results viewing portal (IReV) and compared them with those declared by the electoral umpire. Amenaghawon said the organisation discovered “a 20,364-vote increase in the APC’s tally as reported by INEC compared to the figures obtained from IReV”. He said the “PDP’s vote count showed a decrease of 12,384 votes”. Advertisement Amenaghawon added that the governorship election was marred by “low voter turnout, overvoting, significant irregularities, and incongruencies in election results”. “Civic Hive uncovered widespread flagrant anomalies by INEC officials in the conduct of the election; we discovered a number of over-voting, particularly in Etsako east and other LGAs,” Amenaghawon said. “Particularly, in Oredo LGA, there was an unexplained increase of total valid votes by 10,498, far more than what INEC announced. “This can also be noticed in Egor LGA, where INEC announced total valid votes of 34,022, while the collation on IREV revealed that the number is 28,084. Advertisement “Additionally, there are concerning discrepancies between the figures reported by INEC and those on the IREV platform. “As of October 1, 2024, a thorough analysis by Civic Hive revealed a 20,364-vote increase in the APC’s tally as reported by INEC compared to the figures obtained from IREV. “Meanwhile, the PDP’s vote count showed a decrease of 12,384 votes. “Based on the findings, Civic Hive is calling on the INEC to immediately investigate the irregularities in the election results and activities of presiding officers in Etsako east, Oredo LGA, and across other LGAS whose activities undermine trust in the election process and credibility of election results. Advertisement “Civic Hive also recommends that INEC and the national assembly should start looking at new opportunities and lessons from other democracies on innovations and new avenues that increase how registered voters can vote on election day seamlessly without undermining the integrity and transparency of the electoral system. “The widening gap between registered voters and accredited voters is not good. It is also expedient for INEC to start exploring innovative ways to collate and announce election results without needless bureaucracies and gaps that allow for manipulation of results.” Advertisement THE REPORT The civic tech organisation analysed 4,466 polling units’ results uploaded on the INEC IReV portal for the governorship election. Advertisement The state has 4,519 polling units. The results uploaded on IReV represent 98.83 percent of the polling unit’s results. In the report, the organisation stated that as of October 1, 2024, only five out of 18 LGAs in Edo have completed the upload of polling units’ results. Advertisement The five LGAs are Esan central, Owan east, Esan south-east, Esan north-east, and Igueben. Based on the 98 percent of polling units’ results on IReV, APC recorded 271,303 votes against 291,667 votes declared by INEC, PDP recorded 259,658 votes against 247,274 declared votes, while the Labour Party (LP) recorded 18,600 votes against 22,763 declared votes.

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "【环球时报综合报道】英国广播公司4日报道称，原本位于南极洲的全球最大冰山A23a近日在南大西洋南乔治亚岛搁浅，未来可能发生断裂。报道称，这座高300多米、面积达3234平方米的巨型冰山于1986年从南极冰架分离，在经历了30多年漂流后，自2020年起开始缓慢向北漂移。去年12月，A23a陷入一个名为“泰勒柱”的海洋漩涡，随后继续北上。英国南极调查局当时宣布，A23a很可能漂向南乔治亚岛。\n南乔治亚岛是数百万企鹅和海豹的家园。一些渔民担心，A23a在该岛搁浅可能会干扰企鹅和海豹的觅食路线。此前还有人担忧，如果冰层融化导致冰冷淡水流入，周围的海水温度和盐度将发生变化，生态系统在很大程度上会受到影响。\n但科学家表示，冰山中存在大量营养物质，随着冰层融化，反而会导致海洋生物呈爆炸式增长。英国南极调查局的科学家纳丁·约翰斯顿形容称：“这就像在荒芜的沙漠中投下一颗营养炸弹。”另一名科学家休·格里菲斯也称，冰山是世界上最具生产力的生态系统之一，它们为蓝鲸等海洋生物提供着丰富食物。（杨雯雯）\n海量资讯、精准解读，尽在新浪财经APP\nVIP课程推荐\n加载中...\nAPP专享直播\n热门推荐\n收起\n新浪财经公众号\n24小时滚动播报最新的财经资讯和视频，更多粉丝福利扫描二维码关注（sinafinance）",

    "text": "A Prayer to Look More Like Jesus Today By Emma Danzey “Whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked.” - [1 John 2:6] Although we will never be perfect like Jesus, we are called to live like Jesus. This does not happen in our own efforts or intentions. This is a Holy Spirit filled way of living that reflects Christ in our every day. This is saying no to our flesh and sinful ways and repenting. To repent means to turn away from our sins. We acknowledge the areas that we are not obeying the Lord and we depend on Him to help us live differently. We ask the Spirit within us to set us free from the strongholds in our lives. This is not a new prayer. People throughout the Scriptures sought after lives that honored the Lord as well. Deuteronomy 13:4 says, \"It is the Lord your God you must follow, and him you must revere. Keep his commands and obey him; serve him and hold fast to him.” Ephesians 5:1-2 says, “Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children. And walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.” 1 Peter 2:21 says, “For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps.” In what ways are you not following Christ today? What is He asking you to do that you are neglecting? What is He asking you not to do that you are partaking in? Have you ever noticed how we become like the people we choose to invest our time in? I have had friends who act and have the mannerisms of their husbands now that they have been married for a few years. I have seen it with youth or college students when they select their core group of friends. I have witnessed it in my own life in various seasons. The way that we look more like Jesus is by spending more time getting to know Him. We do this by reading His Word, praying to Him, and inviting Him into our every day. Let's pray: Dear Jesus, Thank You for dying on the cross for our sins and resurrecting yourself to be seated at the right hand of God in glory. You are high above anything that we could imagine. Please help us to realize what a great sacrifice you made on our behalf. Jesus, please enable us to look more like You today. We confess that we are a mess. We were once lost and we are now found. We are your children when we have accepted You as Savior, but that does not mean that we do not wander or struggle. Please give us the strength to walk in Your ways. Help us to repent from our sins and every evil in our hearts, minds, and actions. Give us the ability to live by the fruit of Your Spirit in us. Give us the power to pick up our crosses and follow You. Remind us that Your yoke is easy, and Your burden is light. Thank You for taking our place on the cross. Whether we go out and stay in our homes, whether we have a great day or a horrible one, leads us to live out lives that reflect and point to Your greatness. Help everyone around us to see You shining in our every day lives. May we be witnesses of Your gospel. On top of praying about looking more like You, we need to ask You to help us seek You. You say in Jeremiah 29:13 , “You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.” We will know You more when we seek You greater than we do right now. We will love You more every moment when we learn more about You and Your sacrifice for us. You are the One who has the power to change us. You can give us the desire to pursue Yourself even when we do not feel like it. You can empower us to follow You even on days when we are pressed and challenged by the world and our enemy, the devil. Jesus, You are worthy of our pursuit and of our entire lives. We surrender to You and dedicate today to following You. Amen.
