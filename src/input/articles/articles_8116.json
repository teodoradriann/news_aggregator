    "text": "Never make a sponge cake like this: mistakes that cause the dough to fall off and turn out to be clogged\nSponge cake is one of the most popular bases for cakes and desserts, but making it can be a real challenge. Often, instead of fluffy and airy dough, housewives are faced with low, cracked, or undercooked cakes. The main reason is mistakes that can be avoided if you know the key rules. A successful sponge cake depends on the proper preparation of ingredients, temperature, and whipping technique.\nThe FoodOboz editorial team will tell you what mistakes you shouldn't make so that your sponge cake always turns out perfect. Just a few important nuances can completely change the texture and taste of a dessert.\nWrong number of eggs\nThe common belief that more eggs will make a better sponge cake is wrong. The optimal ratio for a fluffy dough is 4 eggs per 100 g of sugar and 100 g of flour. Increasing the number of eggs can make the sponge cake heavy and too dense.\nIncorrect egg whipping technique\nWhipping the egg whites and yolks separately not only complicates the process but can also make the sponge cake texture rubbery. It is more efficient to beat the eggs together: use a powerful mixer to achieve the desired consistency in 7-15 minutes, depending on the power of the device.\nIgnoring the temperature regime\nThe ideal baking temperature for a sponge cake is 185°C. It is important that the oven is well preheated before baking, and that the temperature is accurate with a kitchen thermometer. Household ovens often give inaccurate readings, which can affect the result.\nUnder- or over-mixing the dough\nMix the ingredients gently to preserve the air bubbles that form when the eggs are beaten. Over-mixing can destroy them, and under-mixing can leave lumps of flour.\nOpening the oven suddenly during baking\nA sudden change in temperature due to the opening of the oven door can cause the sponge cake to settle. Therefore, do not open the oven at all for the first 25 minutes of baking.\nHow to avoid mistakes\n- Use a kitchen scale to accurately measure the ingredients.\n- Beat the eggs properly: keep the mixer at a medium speed and monitor the consistency.\n- Check the oven with a thermometer to avoid temperature fluctuations.\n- Mix the ingredients carefully to avoid disturbing the texture of the dough.\n- Observe the baking time and avoid interfering with the process.",

    "text": "Dyche criticises penalty laws after Everton lose to Man City\nEverton manager Sean Dyche has questioned how Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard's apparent handball against Liverpool wasn't a penalty if Amadou Onana was adjudged guilty of handball in their defeat to Manchester City on Wednesday night. The Toffees felt harshly done by when Julian Alvarez scored a penalty at Goodison Park to make it 2-1 to City.\nTrending While the ball clearly struck Onana's hand, Everton felt the midfielder was very close to Nathan Ake when the City defender took his shot on goal and that his hand was not necessarily in an unnatural position. Dyche called the decision for referee John Brooks to the point to the spot \"bizarre\" post-match.\nThe call came just days after Liverpool were denied a seemingly blatant penalty for a handball offence from Odegaard against Arsenal at Anfield. PGMOL said that the VAR did not overrule referee Chris Kavanagh because it was \"not a clear and obvious error\".\nThey also said the Norwegian's arm moved towards his body and not his ball and that it wasn't a deliberate or unnatural action from the attacking midfielder. Yet it was widely deemed an incorrect call and even Arsenal defender William Saliba reacted: \"Of course, it was a penalty. But, I'm not the referee and we have to accept [the decision].\"\nAnd Dyche said: \"When they [IFAB] come out with these rules, how many active football people, managers, do they speak to? And this can be across the board, it doesn't just have to be the Premier League .\nSean Dyche thinks Liverpool should have had a penalty vs Arsenal (Image: GETTY/SKY SPORTS)\nEverton midfielder Amadou Onana conceded a penalty against Man City (Image: GETTY) \"They may do that, but I have a feeling they probably don't. If they do, they keep it under wraps because I've never heard of it. Handball is such an odd thing. The one the other day from Odegaard, how's that not a penalty? It's just bizarre.\n\"And then our one, that's where we're going and how can those two things be that different in their outcome? You can't work it out. That to me is unfathomable and everyone is scratching their head.\"\nThe Everton manager has claimed all of the Premier League 's managers want to see the handball rule changed. He boss: \"Managers want to see a difference, especially when it's overpowering. The view on handball is overpowering, I don't mind telling you that.\n\"It's not a secret. We had a Zoom call, all the managers were there and they all said this has got to be changed. Roy Hodgson spoke very clearly, as he does about his feelings on it, and gave a couple of incidents and basically we all said we've no clue. It's a real head-scratcher.\n\"One week it's given, the next it's not. There wasn't anyone saying 'we're gaining' or 'we're losing', none of that. It was just that it was wrong on every level and all over the place.\nBecome an Express Premium member\nSupport fearless journalism\nRead The Daily Express online, advert free\nGet super-fast page loading Start 30-day\nFREE trial READ MORE...\nMan Utd could be about to get rid of £86m flop Antony due to three names [COMMENT]\nJohn Terry identifies next Chelsea wonderkid ready to break into first team [OPINION]\nLiverpool may have saved themselves £50m-plus with player Virgil van Dijk loves [FEATURE]\nSean Dyche wants the Premier League handball law tweaked (Image: GETTY) \"Every manager said this has got to change. I just find the rule bizarre and I don't think anyone understands it.\" Ex-Everton boss Roberto Martinez, now in charge of the Portugal national team, said on broadcaster Amazon Prime: \"For me, it is not a penalty at all. For me, football people know that it is not a penalty.\"\nWhile ex- Premier League ref Mark Clattenburg added: \"We're discussing handball for many, many years and we are still no further forward of actually improving it. One week it is given, one week it's not. Is it deliberate or is it not?\n\"Is the arm outstretched or is it not? Every week we are debating it and the referees are just trying to apply the Laws of the Game. If the referee didn't give that penalty, he would be criticised.\n\"He has given it and is criticised. The law needs changing and it needs the coaches, players and referees to get round and try to find a better way to understand handball.\"\nRelated articles Premier League rule has saved Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag from another cruel blow Man Utd receive transfer response as Erik ten Hag 'eyes second January deal'",

    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open.\nFewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions.\nWarmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan.\nIn Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas.\nOn Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain.\nWarm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each.\nMount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow.\nJames Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season.\n\"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said.\n\"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\"\nApex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls.\nShalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow.\n\"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\"\nAt Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open.\nSeveral resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit.\n\"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled.\nEnvironment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland.\nProctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\"\nHe said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior.\nBut Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations.\n\"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.\nChuck Chiang, The Canadian Press",
