    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle.\nThe Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\"\nTwo of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France.\nHis Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back.\nAva Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings.\nOn Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war.\n‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales.\n“It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.”\nCoogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums.\n“The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.”\nLt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled.\n“I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said.\nShe noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out.\nOnce they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away.\nAlthough there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called.\n“I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.”\nA car wreck took her 3 kids. Now through surrogacy, she is a mom again to a baby boy. A Georgia family was about to lose insurance for teen's cancer battle. Then they got help.

McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York.\nLt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, online records show.\nFay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life.\n“He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said.\nOnce Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost.\n“He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.”\nIt ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said.\n“That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "No ‘jagran’ in Kalkaji mandir without permission: Delhi HC The Delhi High Court has ordered that no “jagran” or a similar event without its permission shall be held in the Kalkaji mandir where a 45-year-old woman died recently when a stage set up for a religious function collapsed. NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court has ordered that no “jagran” or a similar event without its permission shall be held in the Kalkaji mandir where a 45-year-old woman died recently when a stage set up for a religious function collapsed. Justice Prathiba M Singh observed that the temple is under the full management and control of an administrator appointed by the high court and its premises is for the use of the public and no individual or entity can exercise exclusive control on any part of it. “No jagran shall be held or any other similar events would be permitted in the Kalkaji mandir. If any organisation wishes to hold any jagran or similar religious programme, such organisation may approach the court for seeking permission by way of an application,” the judge said in a recent order. “The learned administrator having been appointed and given full management and control, any event that has to be organised would require permission. Without the same, no programme shall be organised within the mandir precincts,” the court said. In the order, the court took into account the “recent unfortunate jagran incident” that occurred in the intervening night of January 27 and 28 and sought a status report in relation to the probe, which is to be conducted expeditiously. The event was organised without the administrator’s authorisation. The 45-year-old woman died and 17 people were injured during the “jagran” (religious function), which was organised at the Mahant Parishar of the temple. Around 1,600 people attended the event. “The SHO, Kalkaji submits that an FIR has been registered in respect of the incident. Let the investigation be conducted in an expeditious manner and a status report placed by the next date of hearing before the court, stating as to who were the persons responsible for the incident,” the court ordered. It added that several societies are claiming to be operating from the Kalkaji mandir premises in the name of the temple and those cannot be allowed to “function in this manner for holding programmes in the precincts of the mandir, without the permission of the learned administrator”. “The entire management, control and administration of Shri Kalkaji Mandir has to be only under the supervision of the learned administrator and not under the control of any other person, society or entity,” the court said. “The premises of the Kalkaji Mandir is for the use by the public and no individual or entity can exercise exclusive control on any part of the said premises,” it said. The court, in the order, also asked the administrator to take steps for the revival of the Shri Kalkaji Mandir Prabandhak Sudhar Committee, which can recruit volunteers for crowd management. “All steps shall be taken to ensure that there is proper crowd management at the mandir premises,” the court said as it sought a report in this regard. The court’s order came on batch of pleas on the issue of civic amenities and cleanliness in and around the Kalkaji temple complex. In 2021, Justice Singh appointed retired high court judge J R Midha as the administrator of the temple for performing various functions in relation to the religious place. It had also directed removal of encroachments and unauthorised occupants and shopkeepers, who did not have any valid legal right to occupy the shops, and appointed Goonmeet Singh Chauhan, a renowned architect who has undertaken various projects of public importance, to submit a re-development plan for the temple and the entire surrounding complex.",

    "text": "Farmingdale-based John’s Crazy Socks is introducing its “official” socks in time for this year’s World Down Syndrome Day, on March 21. The company worked with Down Syndrome International and the National Down Syndrome Society to develop the socks. The theme of World Down Syndrome Day 2024 is “End the Stereotypes.” The company will donate 10% of the sale of the socks to Down Syndrome International and the National Down Syndrome Society. “I am so happy that we are making these socks for people around the United Sates and the world to celebrate people with Down Syndrome,” John Cronin, an entrepreneur with Down Syndrome who co-founded John’s Crazy Socks, said in a written statement. “With a meaningful design, these socks send a wonderful message.” To produce the socks, John’s Crazy Socks, Down Syndrome International and The National Down Syndrome Society invited members of the Down Syndrome community to submit designs. The company received designs from around the world and ultimately selected a design submitted by Emma Wanek of Egg Harbor, New Jersey. Wanek, 19, who has Down Syndrome, had graduated with her class in 2023 and is currently a “super senior,” enjoying another year in high school, according to John’s Crazy Socks. Wanek’s design, complete with blue and yellow colors that signify Down Syndrome awareness express that individuals with Down Syndrome are “rock stars,” and feature the 3-21 date on the top band. The socks “will make people happy and we are so excited to collaborate with a company founded and led by an entrepreneur with Down Syndrome,” Andrew Boys, executive director of Down Syndrome International, said in a written statement. “We hope people will wear these socks to celebrate World Down Syndrome Day.” Kandi Pickard, president and CEO of the National Down Syndrome Society, said in a written statement that “John and his company have a commitment to employ people with Down syndrome and differing abilities so we are happy we could work with them on this project.” She added that “the socks are so beautiful. People will love them.” Cronin designed and created the world’s first Down Syndrome awareness socks in 2017. Since then, he has designed other Down Syndrome-themed socks and products. The company has also developed a Down Syndrome “super box” with products that are made by companies that are led by or employ people with Down Syndrome. In 2019, Cronin joined the board of the National Down Syndrome Society. He and his father, Mark Cronin, are part of the NDSS Ambassador’s Program.",
