    "text": "Is Mina Protocol Going to Zero? MINA Price Drops as New Mining Protocol Secures $6.4 Million Leading zero-knowledge blockchain Mina Protocol has seen MINA price drop into retracement following tough resistance, leading some panicked bag-holders asking is Mina Protocol going to zero? This comes following a sensational week-long pump, which saw MINA price climb +120% amid a broader uptick in crypto asset values. ✅ 190K on-chain accounts — Our chain may stay the same size, but our numbers don’t Decentralization + Scalability = Mina [pic.twitter.com/eC2DnzT5Rl] — Mina Protocol (@MinaProtocol) [December 26, 2023] Growth appears to have been fuelled by explosive scaling of on-chain activity across the blockchain, which now has 190k+ active addresses. MINA Price Analysis: Is Mina Protocol Going to Zero Amid Retracement Move? As downside price action grips the chart, MINA Protocol is currently trading at a [market price of $1.29](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/MINAUSDT/) (representing a 24-hour change of -2.26%). The downtick in price appears to have been triggered by topside historical resistance around $1.48 – a level last touched in May 2022. This showcases the significant recovery in MINA price, which broke away from steadfast under footing from the 20DMA on December 20. Price is now heavily diverged away from the 20DMA (at around +39%), this creates a potential downside risk down to the current 20DMA price level at $0.92. Meanwhile, the 200DMA (stood down at $0.52) has began to flip into ascendant posture – in a display of technical strengthening. The sudden downtick can be explained best by looking at the RSI indicator, which is still showing severe overbought divergence at 74.73 – indicating a further need for retracement. However, this is contrasted by the MACD which is continuing to show bullish momentum in price at 0.0520 – suggesting strong pressure remains in the chart. Overall, MINA price looks strong here, with an overdue healthy retracement currently taking place that could set the stage for a second rally leg if price is able to consolidate recent gains at a lower support level. This leaves MINA price with an upside target above resistance at $1.50 (a potential +16.32%). While downside risk could see MINA price retreat down to 20DMA support at $0.93 (a possible -27.88%). Mina Protocol therefore carries a risk: reward ratio of 0.59 – a bad entry that could leave traders exposed to substantial downside risk on the short-time frame – but certainly not going to zero. But while Mina Protocol offers a downside outlook on the short-time frame, a Bitcoin cloud mining presale has exploded as traders take position in Beta plays ahead of the next halving.

[pic.twitter.com/JX3G4zG2BP] — Bitcoinminetrix (@bitcoinminetrix) [December 27, 2023] With the Bitcoin Minetrix approach, gone are the days of heavy initial capital and navigating complex mining contracts. $7M In The Crosshairs: Bitcoin Minetrix Surges Past $6.5M As Markets Rush To Bitcoin Cloud Mining Since the 2021 Bull Run, Bitcoin mining has defied expectations by undertaking something of a renaissance in network growth. Bitcoin’s [Hash Rate](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/hash-rate) (a measure of the total amount of computational power directed at mining Bitcoin blocks) has surged to an incredible all-time high of 456.6 Exahashes per second (EH/S). This dramatic growth has been fuelled by a substantial increase in the scale of Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms’ mining operations. The world’s largest Bitcoin miner – Marathon – [reported that for Q3 2023](https://ir.mara.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1333/marathon-digital-holdings-reports-third-quarter-2023-results) it had an average hash rate of 14.2 EH/s (a 500% growth YoY), around 4% of the overall network hash (mining around 1153 BTC per month, or, $42.2M USD). Meanwhile Riot Platforms reported [a new record hash rate of 10.9 EH/s](https://www.riotplatforms.com/riot-platforms-reports-third-quarter-2023-financial-results-current-operational-and-financial-highlights/) (mining around 368 BTC per month, or, $13.3M USD), with Riot’s operations expected to grow to 20.2 EH/s by summer 2024. But while the all-time high in Bitcoin network hash rate is healthy for Bitcoin network security, and clearly profitable for growing mining operations, it has also begun to lose sight of the original promise of Satoshi Nakamoto’s decentralization. Bitcoin mining in 2023 is the most centralized it has ever been in its short 15-year history. A closer look at the summary of mined blocks over the past 48-hours reveals that a shocking [55.79%](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/pools) of all Bitcoin block rewards go to just two Bitcoin mining pools. AntPool took the largest share at 83 blocks mined (29.123%), while second largest mining pool Foundry USA mined 76 blocks (26.667%). This dwarfs the number of blocks mined by even third place F2Pool (34 blocks mined, around 11.93%), highlighting the growing challenge of increased mining centralization.m This heightened network activity, and increased centralization of mining power has become clearly reflected in the consequent all-time high in the difficulty rate for mining Bitcoin. Currently standing at 62,573,539,549,305 – it has never been harder for the individual participant to engage in profitable Bitcoin mining. This challenge of heightened network difficulty, fuelled by increased competition and centralization of mining power, has created the need for new solutions for the retail investor to participate in Bitcoin mining – both for network decentralization and preserving Bitcoin as a profitable activity for the individual. Enter Bitcoin Minetrix, which was launched to deliver secure and transparent Bitcoin mining rewards for the retail investor through an innovative, decentralized Bitcoin cloud mining approach.

    "title": "Opinion | Trump’s news conference shows how panicked he is - The Washington Post",
    "text": "“Unhinged” has become a shopworn word in the years since Donald Trump descended the escalator in Trump Tower. But the former president’s hour-long news conference on Thursday afternoon from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida might have been a new personal best. Trump sees what we all see: the euphoria that has overtaken Harris’s party, the tens of thousands who are flocking to her inaugural swing through battleground states, the torrent of poll numbers that show the race is suddenly tied . “We were given Joe Biden , and now we’re given somebody else,” he said, adding — not convincingly — “I think, frankly, I’d rather be running against somebody else.” But rather than framing a sharp and coherent case against Harris, which his strategists so desperately want him to do, the former president on Thursday veered from grievance to grievance like a pinball. As he took questions from the media, desperation was practically oozing from his pores. And without the cheers of a rally crowd punctuating his rambling monologue, the incoherence of what he had to say was all the more apparent. Follow Karen Tumulty How much Trump misses and needs those throngs of supporters was clear. Again and again, he boasted — lied, actually — about their size. “Nobody has spoken to crowds bigger than me,” Trump said, claiming that he drew more people to the National Mall than the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. did in 1963 when the civil rights leader gave his “I Have a Dream” speech. He lamented, falsely, that the numbers that Harris is drawing have been inflated by the media. Yet Trump has been strangely absent lately from the stage he loves, and his most recent appearances have been disasters. He delivered a racist rant about Harris at the National Association of Black Journalists convention on July 31, and days later attacked Georgia’s popular Republican governor, Brian Kemp, during a rally in Atlanta. This week, his only rally is on Friday in deep-red Montana. Asked why he is doing so little campaigning, Trump first dismissed that as a “stupid question” and then claimed it is “because I’m leading by a lot and because of letting their convention go through a lot, I’m doing tremendous amounts of taping here. We have commercials that are at a level I don’t think that anybody’s ever done before.” Really? In the first five days of this month, Trump and his allies spent about $16.5 million on advertising, according to AdImpact . That compares with about $23 million by President Joe Biden, Harris and their allies. Since early March, the ad-tracking firm estimates, the Democratic side has spent nearly three times as much as Trump’s has. The truth about Trump and his fixations is often made clearest by what he chooses to lie about. He’s scared, because he is running behind — in polls and in fundraising. And he isn’t at all sure what to do about it. And, oh, there was some actual news in this news conference: Trump proposed three dates next month for debates with Harris. As of this writing, Harris has agreed to one of them, on Sept. 10, sponsored by ABC News. That is the same arrangement previously agreed to by Trump and Biden. There have been many unpredictable twists in this campaign, and surely there will be more to come. For now, however, the biggest question is whether Trump, a master of driving events, can climb out of the back seat in which he finds himself. - Opinion|The Navy is breaking down.

    "text": "O Conselho do Programa de Parcerias de Investimentos (PPI), vinculado à Casa Civil da Presidência da República, aprovou, nesta quarta-feira (16), o financiamento de R$ 7 milhões para a Prefeitura de Belo Horizonte (PBH) com o objetivo de contratar estudos para a viabilidade da implantação do novo bairro na área do antigo Aeroporto Carlos Prates.\nA parceria entre o Executivo municipal e federal teve início após a desativação do aeroporto, realizada pelo governo federal em 2023. Os aportes serão destinados ao desenvolvimento de quatro estudos técnicos para estruturar o bairro de forma financeiramente sustentável, ambientalmente responsável e socialmente inclusiva.\nConforme a resolução publicada no Diário Oficial da União (DOU), está prevista a contratação dos seguintes serviços:\nestudo de mercado imobiliário, estudo de mobilidade e adensamento anteprojeto de implantação modelagem econômica (que dependente dos demais estudos) A parceria valida o compromisso firmado em fevereiro de 2024, quando foi assinado o Acordo de Cooperação Técnica (ACT) entre a PBH e a Secretaria de Patrimônio da União. O acordo prevê o compartilhamento de responsabilidades, incluindo a elaboração de estudos e a estruturação de um modelo de gestão para a área onde ficava localizado o Aeroporto Carlos Prates.\nA proposta da PBH é que a área englobe habitação de qualidade, áreas verdes, equipamentos públicos e soluções inteligentes para mobilidade e infraestrutura. Desde a assinatura do ACT, a prefeitura da Capital já elaborou um macroplano urbanístico, iniciou a recuperação do Parque Maria do Socorro e realizou a instalação dos primeiros equipamentos de saúde e educação.\nA previsão é que os estudos estejam concluídos em 2026, permitindo a abertura dos processos de licenciamento e a formalização da transferência definitiva da área ao município.\nCom informações da PBH",

    "text": "SAN ANTONIO — The holiday season [brought confusion and heartbreak](/article/news/local/savanah-soto-pregnant-teen-disappeared-induced-matthew-guerra/273-7a256266-d755-4e99-8feb-381bd2bc08ed) for two San Antonio families after a pregnant woman and her boyfriend were found dead a few days after going missing. Savanah Soto and Matthew Guerra were found dead with gunshot wounds in a locked car this week. Police have classified their investigation as a capital murder case, and released footage of two unidentified persons of interest they are seeking. Here's everything we know about the case so far, with new information added as it is revealed. When did Soto go missing? Leon Valley police [issued a CLEAR Alert ](/article/news/local/leon-valley-police-searching-pregnant-18-year-old/273-78d1e73c-8a72-46a2-bd35-99ed9483ba0d)for the 18-year-old on Christmas, after she was scheduled to go to the hospital Saturday to be induced. She never showed up. Family members said they hadn't heard from Soto since Friday, and [started organizing searches](/article/news/local/family-organizes-search-for-missing-pregnant-teen-christmas-night/273-c734f696-7c9c-4e22-be5a-48894d408550) on Christmas night. On Tuesday, police also said Guerra, Soto's 22-year-old boyfriend, was [considered a missing person](/article/news/local/savanah-soto-boyfriend-missing-disappearance-pregnant-teen-induced-police/273-cf19fbee-70fa-4994-81cb-0206dfc4bcca). How were they found? A family member on Tuesday was alerted about a car found in an apartment complex in the Medical Center area of San Antonio. Authorities confirmed to KENS 5 that Soto and Guerra were found inside, dead from gunshot wounds to the head. SAPD also said in a report that an unborn baby was dead, and Police Chief William McManus said it's believed the car was in the parking lot for three to four days. McManus said it wasn't immediately clear what had happened that led to the two victims' deaths. Relatives say Soto was found in the front seat with a car seat on top of her, while Guerra's body was in the back seat. \"It's a very, very perplexing crime scene,\" McManus said Tuesday evening, in an update to news media and family members who had congregated at the complex. \"Detectives are looking at this as a possible murder, but we're not sure. We can't say for sure what we have.\" SAPD has since classified their case as a capital murder investigation. Have police arrested anyone? San Antonio police haven't identified any suspects in the case, but on Thursday afternoon authorities [released footage](https://twitter.com/SATXPolice/status/1740486837565886590) of two persons of interested they're seeking in the investigation. One is seen driving a dark pickup truck, the other driving the silver car Soto and Guerra were found in. Anyone with information about the vehicles or individuals seen in the video is asked to call SAPD at (210) 207-7674 or (210) 207-7440. Another update is expected around 3:30 p.m. Thursday. What have the families said? \"It breaks my heart,\" Soto's mother, Gloria Cordova, told KENS 5 before her daughter was eventually found. Cordova said Soto was [making final preparations ](/article/news/local/who-killed-savanah-soto-her-unborn-baby-matthew-guerra-both-families-speak-out/273-6877248a-fade-4124-8b0a-5ee472aab874)to be a mom, having completed a nursery. But when Cordova tried to check on Soto at her apartment on Saturday, no one answered. Now the Soto family, along with police and Guerra's relatives, are on similar searches for answers. “I hope they pay for whatever they did to my daughter,” Cordova told KENS 5 on Wednesday, saying she had had a bad feeling that something terrible had happened to her daughter and Fabian. \"It's not something that a mom ever wants to hear. I didn't want to accept it.\" Cordova said she suspects Guerra was involved with illegal activity. His father says he knew his son had a criminal history including unlawful carry of a weapon, evading police and an assault charge causing bodily injury. “He didn’t hang around the best crowd,” Gabriel Guerra said. He confirmed the assault charge involved Soto on Christmas 2022. However, he said, the two had been in a good place ever since and living together in Leon Valley. “They were inseparable,\" Gabriel Guerra said. \"Was it a perfect relationship? No, but she definitely was not a prisoner there. Her and Matthew were both overjoyed and couldn’t wait for Fabian’s arrival.” He believed Matthew was going to change for the better once he became a father. “He talked about how it was going to make him better, a better person,” Gabriel Guerra said.
