    "title": "Welcome the New Year with Great Hope!",
    "text": "Jesus, our living hope, will make it possible for us to alter our minds and behaviors. We are on the threshold of a new year. Everyone is getting ready for the greeting, “Happy New Year!” Yet, American author-teacher-preacher Francis Chan once described today’s Christians as terrible hopers at a Christian conference. He said, “We expect the worst because we’ve been let down too much.” Is it right for us to feel this way about hope—to lower our expectations so that we don’t get disappointed? In the Bible, there was a man who did not fit the terrible hopers’ profile. His name: Simeon. Described to be as righteous and devout, “it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ” ( [Luke 2:26](https://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/2-26.html)). Simeon was not given a date and time to expect the coming of Jesus; he only knew that death would not overcome him until its fulfillment. Knowing what aging does to us, the aches and pains of our failing bodies can make us terrible hopers—but not Simeon! Joseph, Mary, and their child Jesus traveled to Jerusalem from [Bethlehem](https://www.ibelieve.com/holidays/why-was-jesus-born-in-bethlehem.html) to offer their sacrifice according to the Law after the completion of the purification process. “[Simeon] came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the Law, [Simeon] took him up in his arms and blessed God and said, ‘Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace, according to your word; for my eyes have seen your salvation that you have prepared in the presence of all people, a light for revelation to the Gentiles. And for the glory to your people Israel’” (v. 27-32). A Harvard Health article said, “…hope beyond the possible is a recipe for eventual disappointment and disillusionment.” This is the perfect statement for terrible hopers to cling to. Can you imagine waiting for something without an expected date of arrival? We want to spend our energy on hope that makes sense. Like Simeon, we are awaiting the return of [Jesus Christ](https://www.christianity.com/jesus/)—and no one knows the time and day! We are only told “not to lose heart” ( [2 Corinthians 4:16](https://www.biblestudytools.com/2-corinthians/4-16.html)). Hope as Motivation Hope is meant to be a positive motivation for us, something to help us shape and determine a positive outcome as we visualize that moment of fulfillment. For Simeon, he embraced the promise of seeing the Messiah, Israel’s hope. Comforted by the Holy Spirit’s personal revelation to him, the promise gave Simeon a wonderful reason to live a life of quality, a life of hope. He was probably happier and healthier than the hopeless ones around him! Often, we begin to squander our lives on excess once we know how much time we have left on earth, thinking we can only enjoy our best days by following the “you only live once” mantra of the world. Before Jesus went to the cross, He told His disciples, “Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me. In my Father’s house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also” ( [John 14:1-3](https://www.biblestudytools.com/john/passage/?q=john+14:1-3)). After three years of togetherness, imagine how sad and brokenhearted His disciples must have been to hear of His departure. So, Jesus had to explain why they could have hope even when He was gone from their presence. He was helping them to grasp the fact that in knowing Him and seeing Him, they had already known and seen the Father. This is the same explanation we are embracing today—the promise of Jesus returning for you and me. There is nothing to doubt about Jesus’s words. Hope for the Future We can’t be terrible hopers as followers of Jesus Christ because whatever good stuff—or not-so-good stuff—we are experiencing in this life today will not compare to what awaits us in eternity. To further encourage the followers of Jesus Christ, the Apostle Peter even painted a beautiful picture of hopeful waiting, when he said we “have been born to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for [us], who by God’s power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time” ( [1 Peter 1:3-5](https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-peter/passage/?q=1 peter+1:3-5)). If then we have the living hope, Jesus Christ, His hope should influence us to be optimistic people. Jesus, our living hope, will make it possible for us to alter our minds and behaviors. Peter encourages us to “[prepare our] minds for action, and being sober-minded, [to] set [our] hope fully on the grace that will be brought to [us] at the revelation of Jesus Christ” (v.13). Again, we are to set our minds fully on this beautiful picture of grace, so that we can stop ourselves from becoming terrible hopers, waiting impatiently…and totally unprepared for the glory yet to come. Hope Beyond Our Wildest Imaginations In the final chapter of the Book of Revelation, Jesus said these hopeful words several times: “Behold, I am coming soon…,” with a final and definitive statement meant to drive home the assurance we desperately need to hear: “Surely I am coming soon” (22:7, 12, 20). What’s important is to remember that Jesus stressed what we are to do in our hopeful waiting: 1) keep the words of the Bible, 2) keep living a righteous and holy life and, 3) remember that He will do a final accounting of our deeds. Dupé Aleru, a Christian content coach, posted on her LinkedIn: “What God has in store is beyond your wildest imagination.” The Apostle Paul confirmed what is written about the coming glory revealed to us through the Spirit: “What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man imagined, what God has prepared for those who love him” ( [1 Corinthians 2:9](https://www.biblestudytools.com/1-corinthians/2-9.html)). If that is the case, followers of Jesus Christ should be excitedly preparing for something better, something beyond our wildest imagination that is to come! There is no reason for us to hold on to the label of terrible hopers. Let’s welcome the New Year with gladness in our hearts knowing that Jesus Christ will be returning…soon!

    "text": "NWS Red Flag Warning over dry, windy, hot conditions; counties step up burn restrictions Ongoing dry conditions have led to fire warnings and restrictions on burning across the Treasure Coast. The National Weather Service placed Indian River and St. Lucie counties under a Red Flag Warning Friday, which means strong winds, low humidity and warm temperatures could lead to \"critical fire weather conditions.\" Martin County Fire Rescue declared any burning activity Friday was not permitted due to what the agency said were increased wildfire concerns amid worsening drought conditions. Firefighters stopped an outside fire Wednesday that threatened to \"spread out of control\" near Allapattah Flats Wildlife Management Area, according to the agency's social media post. It is 15 miles west of Stuart. Indian River County has been under a burn ban since April 8, and on May 8 county emergency officials declared a local state of emergency with a mandatory burn ban for all areas of the county \"until further notice.\" All outdoor burning is prohibited unless specifically permitted by the Florida Forest Service, according to the Department of Emergency Services. The agency stated all outdoor fires were prohibited unless authorized by the Florida Forest Service, or consisted of food cooked on a gas or charcoal grill. The National Weather Service Red Flag Warning was in effect from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. Friday. According to the U.S. Forest Service the warnings are made on a daily basis, or one 24-hour period at a time during which wind speeds are above 20 mph, relative humidity is 15% or less and there is a high to extreme fire danger rating. As of Friday, no burn bans were in place in St. Lucie County. The Treasure Coast was under moderate drought conditions Friday, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's drought monitor site, [Drought.gov](https://www.drought.gov/states/florida). About 14% of the state is in this category, from northern Palm Beach County to mid-Brevard County, and portions of Okeechobee, Glades, Osceola and Hendry counties. About 27% of the state is experiencing abnormally dry conditions. No counties have severe drought. In a moderate drought, burn bans are possible, trees and bushes begin browning and water supply decreases. The Florida Forest Service uses the Keetch-Byram drought index (KBDI), which acts as a scale to estimate dryness of soil. The index scale ranges from 0, which means there is no moisture deficit, to 800, according to Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. As of Thursday, the latest date available from the Florida Forest Service, Indian River County was the driest of the Treasure Coast counties, within a 550-599 range, while both St. Lucie and Martin counties were in the 500-549 range. What is considered wet season typically begins in the third to fourth week of May, when sea breeze and low systems bring rain and thunderstorms, said meteorologist Kole Fehling, with the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Melbourne. Rainfall amounts Parts of the Treasure Coast are 6 or 7 inches below what their total rainfall should be by this time of year. Indian River County typically has 12.07 inches of rain by May. As of Friday, it's had 5.35 inches, which is down by 6.72 inches, according to NWS Meteorologist Tim Sedlock. In Fort Pierce he said a total of 5.61 inches of rain had been recorded since January, which is a departure from the normal 11.3 inches by 5.82 inches. In Stuart, a total of 10.46 inches so far this year could not be compared because the agency does not have an official weather data recording site in Martin County, Sedlock said. Both Vero Beach and Fort Pierce last saw \"trace\" amounts of rain May 1, while Stuart received 2 inches of rain on that date. Total rain amounts for April, Sedlock said, were \"not very good,\" with .45 inches of rain in Vero Beach, .55 in Fort Pierce and .80 in Stuart.
