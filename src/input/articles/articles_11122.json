    "text": "Another growing season is drawing to a close, and as with the last few years, it’s been a challenging one overall for Ontario’s fruit and vegetable growers.\nWhile some sectors have been less affected than others, there’s no denying that ongoing rising costs, ever-increasing market pressures and regulatory challenges at all levels of government are taking their toll on the entire industry. Over the past five months, the Ontario Fruit and Vegetable Growers’ Association (OFVGA) and our partners in the Ontario Agricultural Sustainability Coalition (OASC) have had open and frank discussions on these issues with Ontario’s minister of agriculture, food and agribusiness, Rob Flack.\nIt’s a continuation of our advocacy for an increase of $100 million in the annual Risk Management Program (RMP) and Self-Directed Risk Management (SDRM) budget – currently at $150 million annually – that has been ongoing since early 2021.\nSince the last investment in RMP and SDRM by the provincial government in 2020, the inflationary impact of the pandemic and its aftermath continues to place a heavy burden on growers. Although most aspects of life have returned to normal, we continue to deal with extremely tight or even negative margins on our farms.\nDespite ongoing high prices at the grocery store, retailers are rigidly holding the line on prices to growers due to imports and price ceilings they’ve set to maintain and even boost their profits. At the same time, we must navigate unprecedented and stubbornly high production costs. At the grower level, this means we are starting to see cracks in the financial sustainability of many of our farm businesses, putting stress on farm families and leading to very difficult decisions for growers as they contemplate their futures in the fruit and vegetable industry.\nCompetitiveness is another critical challenge facing Ontario growers. Many international jurisdictions have lower production costs and fewer regulatory and policy restrictions than we have here at home. At the same time, it is likely that the American government will be putting forward an updated $2 trillion U.S. Farm Bill that will bolster crop insurance, expand research, and enhance subsidies to the industry south of the border at the expense of trading partners and competing jurisdictions like ours.\nWe face competitive disadvantages domestically as well, with Québec fruit and vegetable growers receiving more than double the support than what we have access to here in Ontario. To put it simply, the ongoing rising costs, ever-increasing market pressures and regulatory challenges at all levels of government are hindering the ongoing and future viability of Ontario’s fruit and vegetable production. We need help to ensure we don’t lose our ability to feed Ontarians with locally grown produce.\nAt the same time, we recognize that the provincial government is facing its own fiscal constraints, and we have built accommodation for those realities into our proposal for an enhanced SDRM/RMP to the ministry.\nIn our presentation to Minister Flack at a roundtable he hosted at the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair in November, I reiterated our ask and the need to continue to move forward with a sense of urgency. Growers are struggling and facing tough financial decisions about how – or even if – to proceed with next season’s crops.\nOver the next few weeks and months, as the provincial government prepares for its next budget, we will continue to demonstrate the win-win nature of our proposal for farmers, taxpayers and the government and how it will let us grow jobs and our agri-food value chain while protecting our ability to produce high quality, reliable food right here at home.",

    "text": "Chennai: From the age of three, Inayat grew up without her father's love and presence in her life. Despite this absence, she decided to follow in her father's footsteps and join the army. Inayat deliberately chose to wear the same uniform her father, Major Navneet Vats, wore before he lost his life battling terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir. During the remarkable passing out parade at the Army’s Officers Training Academy in Chennai, the inspirational story of Inayat Vats came to light. Now Lieutenant Inayat Vats, she represents the third generation in her family devoted to military service.Originally from Panchkula, Haryana, Inayat graduated from Lady Shri Ram College of Delhi University and is currently pursuing an MA in Political Science at Hindu College.Inayat's mother, Shivani, shared a touching moment when Inayat once asked what she would have done if she were a boy. Shivani responded that she would have encouraged her to join the National Defence Academy (NDA) or the Indian Military Academy (IMA). Despite the possibility of a more comfortable life, Shivani expressed her happiness that Inayat chose to follow in her father's footsteps and join the army.In this manner, Inayat has not only honoured her father's legacy but has also embraced her own ideals by choosing to serve her country in the same way he did.About Her Father, Major Navneet Vats Major Navneet Vats, who hailed from Chandigarh, always harboured a childhood dream of donning the revered 'Olive Green' uniform. He pursued this aspiration and joined the army, eventually being commissioned in the 4th Battalion of the 3 Gorkha Rifles Regiment. His life took on new meaning when he married Shivani, and together they welcomed their daughter, Inayat, into the world. Inayat brought immense joy and cherished moments into Major Navneet's life until tragedy struck on November 20, 2003.Having served diligently with his unit for several years, Major Navneet was deployed to Srinagar with the 32 Rashtriya Rifles, engaged in counter-insurgency operations amidst challenging circumstances. On November 18, 2003, terrorists seized control of a government building in Srinagar, prompting the security forces to launch a joint operation to address the crisis. Two days later, on November 20th, Major Navneet Vats was entrusted with leading the assault team for a critical operation to neutralise the terrorists.The operation was fraught with danger, as the terrorists were entrenched in secure positions within the building, armed with automatic weapons. Undeterred by the risks, Major Navneet fearlessly led his team into the fray. Despite facing heavy gunfire from the well-entrenched terrorists, Major Navneet and his brave comrades pressed forward with determination to eliminate the threat.Tragically, during the intense exchange of fire, Major Vats sustained six bullet wounds to his upper body. Four other courageous soldiers, including a Colonel, were also gravely injured. Despite losing a significant amount of blood from his wounds, Major Navneet valiantly fought on. Regrettably, he succumbed to his injuries, making the ultimate sacrifice in the service of his country.For his extraordinary bravery, unwavering fighting spirit, and supreme sacrifice, Major Navneet Vats was posthumously awarded the gallantry medal, the \\\"Sena Medal.\\\" His courageous leadership and selfless actions during the operation will forever be remembered as a testament to his commitment to duty and love for his country.",
