Today we benefit from numerous advances in hunting technology and manufacturing — in everything from the bullets we shoot to the stoves we use to boil our water at the end of the day. Our equipment and our methods have become better in every way, including how we stabilize our rifle for a shot. It wasn’t long ago that even\nbipods on rifles were a fatuous novelty, and a woodsman’s only choices were to improvise a hasty rest or pinball bullets through the trees with a desperate offhand effort.\nThere is certainly a time and place to apply the commendable skill of offhand shooting, but we’ve since come out of the dark ages. Many types of shooting rests — specifically tripods — have evolved dramatically. The modern shooting tripod is a platform that offers versatility and stability to help make just about any hunter more confident and effective when it’s time to take the shot.\nEvolution of the Shooting Tripod\nThe shooting tripod as we know it is relatively new; it’s a product of rapid development during the Global War on Terror and the rise of competitive PRS, NRL, and sniper matches. As a kid in the 1990s, I never saw anyone using a tripod as a shooting rest. Bipods were becoming more mainstream in my teenage years and when my dad and I got into coyote calling, we found that shooting sticks or a sitting-height bipod provided better stability and surer shots than we could ever manage before. It’s that same realization — that support and stability facilitate better accuracy — that drove the development of the shooting tripod.\nYou Can’t Always Go Prone\nMy first exposure to the concept of a shooting tripod was in 2009, when my buddy Richard Gilbert was giving me pointers from his time as a Scout Sniper in the Marine Corps. Bipods were mainstream by then and I’d spent five or six years with my arm wrapped in a service rifle sling at that point. It simply hadn’t occurred to me to use a tripod.\n“There are lots of shots you might have to take without the ability to go prone,” Gilbert told me.\nHe then described how they would take a photographer’s tripod and make what he called a HOG saddle (H.O.G. is the USMC acronym for “hunter of gunmen”). As I remember his explanation, they would cut a short piece of PVC pipe in half, line it with foam padding, and mount that “saddle” to the top of the tripod in which the shooter could now nestle and balance their sniper rifle. A few years later, the much-refined clamp-style\nHOG Saddle became standard-issue and quickly caught on in the civilian market, too.\nRecent long-range precision shooting and competition have also driven both the gear and technique sides of the shooting tripod. The Swiss ARCA system — standard mounting dovetail for tripods has even become more commonly incorporated into production rifles, and now there are tripods for just about any shooting application.\nVariants of the Shooting Tripod\nThere are types, styles, and sizes of shooting tripods that fit an abundance of applications. Generally though, hunters will choose one of these three.\nHOG Saddle or Clamp Shooting Tripod\nThe HOG Saddle shooting tripod was the first to become really popular among hunters, and it’s still going strong. The defining feature of the HOG Saddle and its many copies is an adjustable padded clamp that grasps the stock of the rifle — usually at the balance point or just forward of the magazine. The vise-jaw-type clamp holds the rifle securely, helping to reduce shaking and movement while you get on target and break the shot.\nThese tripod heads work well with a wide variety of rifles and don’t require special hardware or adapters on the rifle. They simply grab it and hold it securely. It’s a great option for the everyday hunter, and a useful tool for teaching young or new shooters. The\nBOG Deathgrip is probably the most well-known commercial example of this, but the Kopfjager with Reaper Grip is also popular. If you already have a tripod, there are many affordable HOG Saddle style heads that you can try out.\nSwiss ARCA Shooting Tripod\nThe most popular shooting tripods usually have a\nSwiss ARCA ball head. This allows for some overlap with other shooting tripod systems like the HOG Saddle or a tac table, because some of those mount directly to an ARCA head, but many shooters use the ARCA system to clip their rifle directly onto the tripod. Many rifle chassis now include an integral ARCA rail, and you can even get an ARCA rail handguard for your AR or Ruger precision rifle. Even lightweight mountain rifles like the Bergara Premier MG Lite and Seekins Havak Slam featured in our 2024 Rifle Test incorporate small bits of ARCA rail to clamp right into a tripod. Even on a lightweight tripod in the mountains, this provides incredible stability.\nThe ARCA mounting system — which is standard for camera equipment — is well supported and since it’s compatible with other accessories, makes for the most versatile shooting tripod.\nThe Shooting-Tripod Tac Table\nOne of the most popular shooting tripod accessories for your ARCA setup is a\ntac table. You can buy these in many different styles, and materials. You can even make one out of a plastic cutting board for less than $20. A tac table is essentially just a small flat table that mounts to the top of your tripod, usually with a piece of ARCA rail. These are commonly used by competitive shooters, but tac tables are also useful for hunting because you can set a small shooting bag on top of the table for a solid rest for shooting or glassing, but you can use the table for a rear support when shooting from a standing position.\nThe Spartan System Shooting Tripod\nA third common style of shooting tripod, and brainchild of our British friend Rob Gearing, is the magnetic post and socket system that’s the basis for\nSpartan Precision Equipment. The company prides itself on thoughtful, multi-use designs and excellent materials. Their product line has become a cult favorite among North American mountain hunters for their lightweight Javelin bipods. They also have a number of lightweight and heavy-duty shooting tripods, too. The Spartan shooting tripod system is built around a small magnetic post that fits into a socket on the rifle. These sockets are either attached in place of the sling swivel stud, clamped onto a piece of Picatinny rail, or embedded permanently into the stock. Some stocks like what we saw on the Savage Klym, include the adapter, and it’s offered as a rail option on the new Rokstock from Unknown Munitions.\nOne plus of this system is that it’s quick and requires no clamping. Simply drop the socket onto the magnetic post and it’s connected. I really like the\nAscent tripod for packing into the mountains after sheep, because another nice perk is that the legs are designed to be removed and be used as trekking poles. I can vouch for their toughness in that application. If you’ve already got a tripod, you can simply buy a Davros ball head if you’re looking to try this system out at a lower cost.\nUsing a Shooting Tripod for Hunting\nAt first, the thought of lugging a tripod around might seem outlandish to most hunters. It’s not so strange to mountain hunters who are already using a tripod for glassing, but everyone else might be harder to convince.\nWith some good instruction on how to\nshoot off a tripod and a bit of practice, though, you will be surprised at just how effective they are. I recently shot my first NRL Hunter match and after a couple weeks of training, I could reliably hit 1.5-MOA targets from a standing position out to 600 yards. That level of confidence and stability makes normal hunting distances feel like chip shots.\nSome of Our Favorite Shooting Tripods\nPicking a shooting tripod depends a lot on your personal taste (and your budget), but here are some of our favorites:\nReally Right Stuff TFCT MK2\n- Material: Carbon fiber\n- Height range: 24.6 inches to 71.1 inches\n- System: ARCA ball head\n- Price: $1,670\nBOG Deathgrip Carbon Fiber\n- Material: Carbon fiber\n- Height Range: 7 inches to 59 inches\n- System: HOG Saddle-style clamp\n- Price: $258\nKopfjager with Reaper Head\n- Material: Carbon fiber\n- Height Range: 19.75 inches to 64 inches\n- System: Rifle clamp\n- Price: $600\nLeupold Mark 5 CF 455\n- Material: Carbon fiber\n- Height Range: 8.3 inches to 74 inches\n- System: ARCA ball head\n- Price: $1,204\nSpartan Precision Ascent\n- Material: Carbon fiber\n- Height Range: 11 inches to 50 inches\n- System: Spartan magnetic post/socket\n- Price: $1,100\nFrequently Asked Questions About Shooting Tripods\nThe best shooting tripod for hunting depends on your application. Larger tripods offer more stability but aren’t as easy to carry around. The most versatile tripod is one with a Swiss ARCA head that can be used with other accessories.\nIdeally, a shooting tripod should be tall enough to allow you to shoot from a standing position in uneven terrain. But if you need a shorter tripod, you should be able to shoot from a sitting or kneeling position. Otherwise, you don’t gain much over a bipod.\nMost Army and other military snipers are using top-end tripods from Really Right Stuff.\nFinal Thoughts on Shooting Tripods\nThere is no perfect all-around tool that fits every hunting or shooting scenario. But a good shooting tripod is one of the most valuable pieces of equipment you can get. Tripods provide unmatched stability in almost any terrain. They can be used as a primary support or as a supplemental aid when building shooting positions. Developing the skills to use a shooting tripod will undeniably make you a more effective shooter whether for hunting, competing, or shooting for fun.",

    "text": "Here is a list of the number of antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crime offences recorded by police forces from October 7 to November 7 2023 inclusive, together with totals for the equivalent periods in 2022 and 2021. The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency from Freedom of Information requests sent to all forces in the UK. The data is a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and may be subject to change. All figures are for crimes recorded by police forces, not incidents. Systems and methods of recording and collating hate crime are not consistent across all forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the volume of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK. Some forces provided notes and responses to the data and these are included where appropriate. Not all forces are included in the list and reasons for omissions are given at the end. – Avon & Somerset Antisemitic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5 The force said that completion of the “hate type” field on its records is not mandatory. Where a crime has taken place it will be recorded, but the hate crime indicator or type will not always be ticked, meaning some offences will have been recorded without an indication of the type of hate crime that has been committed. – Bedfordshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 – British Transport Police Antisemitic: 2021 – 11, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 87 Islamophobic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 22 – Cambridgeshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 6 Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5 The force said the figures are the number of police-recorded religious hate crimes where the perceived religion was Jewish or Muslim, based on the keyword assigned to the crime. – Dorset Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 4 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 1 – Durham Antisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 0 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1 The force said the figures refer to the number of recorded hate crimes where the victim’s religion has been known to be Judaism or Islam. – Gloucestershire Antisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3 The force said the figures are for crimes where a hate tag has been applied, which have then been filtered to identify the hate strands “Religion – Jewish” and “Religion – Muslim”. – Greater Manchester Antisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 15, 2023 – 74 Islamophobic: 2021 – 42, 2022 – 43, 2023 – 34 The force said antisemitic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Jewish. Islamophobic offences are where the perceived targeted religion was recorded as Muslim. More than one perceived religion can be recorded for an offence. Four crimes within the data had both Jewish and Muslim recorded as the perceived targeted religion. – Gwent Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 5 Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 The force said that to obtain the data a filter was applied to identify racial and religious strands and a manual trawl was conducted on the crime summaries. – Hampshire & Isle of Wight Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 5, 2023 – 6 Islamophobic: 2021 – 5, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 4 – Hertfordshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 17 Islamophobic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3 The force said the figures are for crimes that have a “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” (or both) flag attributed to the investigation record. – Humberside Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 2 – Kent Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 9, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 6 The force said the figures are for crime reports with either the “Religion – Jewish” or “Religion – Muslim” prejudice marker attached. Markers are optional and added at the discretion of the inputting officer. – Lancashire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 4 Islamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 The force said the figures had been compiled by searching for hate crimes marked as religious, followed by a manual review of each recorded crime to extract only those that were antisemitic and Islamophobic. – Leicestershire Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 17, 2023 – 6 – Merseyside Antisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 20 Islamophobic: 2021 – 9, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 10 The force said 18 of the 20 antisemitic offences in 2023 are conflict related and one of the 10 Islamophobic offences in 2023 is conflict related. – Norfolk Antisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 2 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 0 – North Wales Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 3 – North Yorkshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 2 The force said the numbers are for offences “reported” to the police. – Northamptonshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 1 The force said the figures show crimes with a racial or religious flag against them, where the search was for the words “Jewish” “Hebrew” “Judaistic”, “Hasidic”, “Islam” and “Muslim”. The search only returned exact matches and does not account for differences in terminology and/or spelling used. The force added that keyword searches are problematic and in no way provide accurate results or figures. – Northumbria Antisemitic: 2021 – 10, 2022 – 3, 2023 – 9 Islamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 7, 2023 – 5 The force said the figures were for offences flagged as “Judaism” and “Islam” and that hate crimes are based on the perception of the victim. – Nottinghamshire Antisemitic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – under 5, 2022 – under 5, 2023 – 19 The force said all crimes have a religious and/or belief marker. – South Wales Antisemitic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 8 Islamophobic: 2021 – 7, 2022 – 6, 2023 – 9 The force said the figures are for occurrences with the qualifier of “Hate/prejudice – anti-Jewish” and “Hate/prejudice anti-Muslim”. – Suffolk Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 1 Islamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 0 – Surrey Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 7 Islamophobic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 8, 2023 – 10 The force noted that offences are flagged as hate crimes at the discretion of the police officer or staff member. – Thames Valley Antisemitic: 2021 – 4, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 21 Islamophobic: 2021 – 12, 2022 – 14, 2023 – 20 – Warwickshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 1, 2022 – 2, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: No information held The force said the figures were obtained by searching for all crimes with a marker of “Hate Motivated – Religion – Jewish” and “Hate Motivated – Religion – Muslim” during the stated periods. – West Mercia Antisemitic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 3, 2022 – 4, 2023 – 4 – West Midlands Antisemitic: 2021 – 8, 2022 – 1, 2023 – 22 Islamophobic: 2021 – 23, 2022 – 33, 2023 – 25 The force said the figures were obtained by searching for the hate strands “Religion – Judaism” and “Religion – Islam”. – West Yorkshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 14, 2022 – 10, 2023 – 53 Islamophobic: 2021 – 38, 2022 – 29, 2023 – 49 The force said the figures represent the number of faith hate crimes recorded where Islam or Judaism was identified as the religion targeted. The force added: “We continue to work to better improve the investigation of hate crime and the outcomes for victims. The force has specialist hate crime co-ordinators who assist investigating officers in identifying perpetrators, providing after-care support for victims and working with communities to increase awareness of hate crime and reporting mechanisms. They also engage in joint working with partners such as local authorities, Victim Support and third-party Hate Incident Reporting Centres.” – Wiltshire Antisemitic: 2021 – 0, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 3 Islamophobic: 2021 – 2, 2022 – 0, 2023 – 5 Some 15 forces are not included in this list. Three forces said the precise data requested was not available; three forces said collection of the precise data requested would exceed the threshold for a Freedom of Information response to be supplied free of charge; four forces said there was a delay in supplying the data; and five forces had failed to respond to the request as of December 28 2023.

    "text": "Gobierno de Biden amenaza con demandar a Texas por su nueva ley de inmigración\nRocío Muñoz-Ledo\n(CNN) — El Departamento de Justicia de Estados Unidos amenazó con demandar a Texas por su nueva ley de inmigración en una carta enviada este jueves, según una copia que CNN obtuvo del documento. Esto supone la escalada más reciente entre el presidente Joe Biden y el gobernador de Texas, el republicano Greg Abbott, sobre la gestión de la frontera entre EE.UU. y México.\nA principios de este mes, Abbott promulgó una ley, conocida como SB4, que otorga a las autoridades locales la facultad de detener a los inmigrantes y a los jueces la capacidad de emitir órdenes para deportarlos de Estados Unidos.\nLa nueva ley de inmigración de Texas siembra confusión e incertidumbre a lo largo de la frontera\nLa Casa Blanca criticó la ley, al calificarla de “increíblemente extrema”. Se espera que entre en vigor en marzo.\nEn una carta dirigida a Abbott, el Departamento de Justicia argumentó que la medida “se antepone y viola la Constitución de EE.UU.” y también amenaza con afectar la capacidad del gobierno federal para hacer cumplir la ley de inmigración.\n“En consecuencia, Estados Unidos tiene la intención de presentar una demanda para impedir la aplicación de la SB4 a menos que Texas acceda a abstenerse de implementar la ley. Estados Unidos se ha comprometido tanto a asegurar la frontera como a garantizar el procesamiento de los no ciudadanos de conformidad con la Ley de Inmigración y Nacionalidad (INA). La ley SB4 es contraria a estos objetivos”, afirma la carta, firmada por el subsecretario adjunto Brian Boynton.\n¿Cómo es la nueva ley de Texas que penaliza la entrada irregular de migrantes al estado? Las claves de la polémica ley SB4\nLa amenaza legal de este jueves se produce después de que el Departamento de Justicia demandara a Texas por el uso de boyas flotantes en el río Grande. La demanda sigue su curso en los tribunales.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Storks injured in Israel's Golan Heights after power line collision - The Jerusalem Post",
    "text": "Dozens of white storks were severely injured in northern Israel during April after colliding with overhead power lines, Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael-Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF) reported on Wednesday.\nAccording to the organization, most incidents occurred in the Golan Heights , particularly in areas where new power lines and wind farms have been built.\nSince the start of the spring migration season, numerous reports have been received of dead or seriously injured storks. Many were evacuated to KKL-JNF’s Wildlife Acclimation Center in poor condition, suffering from open fractures and extensive bleeding.\nIn several cases, the birds had to be euthanized due to the severity of their injuries, KKL-JNF said.\n“Collisions of birds with overhead power lines are a troubling phenomenon that causes serious damage to Israel’s ecosystem every year,” said Yaron Charka, KKL-JNF’s chief ornithologist. “In the current incident, we received field reports of over 30 stork carcasses. Dozens more were found with severe fractures to their wings and legs. It’s a horrifying event.\n“Over the past year, along the western canal in Hula Lake Park, we completed a project to bury a hazardous overhead power line that posed a threat to birds. But addressing this issue on a broader scale requires significant involvement from additional parties.” Injured stork at The Hula Valley Wildlife Acclimatization Center. (credit: Rona Valency, Veterinarian at KKL-JNF's Hula Valley Wildlife Acclimatization Center) Stork evacuation requires a complex logistical effort\nRona Valency, a veterinarian at the Hula Valley Wildlife Acclimatization Center, said each stork evacuation requires a complex logistical effort. “Sometimes several days pass between the moment of injury and the time the bird is discovered, which significantly reduces the likelihood of a successful rescue,” she said. “There is an urgent need to explore ways to minimize these injuries, including marking power lines and proactively preparing known migration routes.”\nAccording to KKL-JNF, electrocution also presents a serious threat to Israel’s bird population , especially rare and endangered species. Utility poles often serve as resting or observation points, but contact with exposed cables can result in fatal electrocutions. While solutions such as insulating poles exist, they offer only partial protection and are being implemented too slowly to be fully effective. How Israel can avoid harming local wildlife while managing urban needs\nDan Alon, CEO of the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, emphasized that such injuries are preventable. “The injury of birds due to collisions with power lines is not an inevitable fate. It is possible to reduce the phenomenon and even prevent it by placing the lines underground or installing measures to reduce bird collisions,” he said.\n“As part of the expansion of Israel’s power grid, many additional lines are expected to be built. Therefore, we must work to avoid installing overhead lines in especially sensitive areas and install mitigation measures on existing overhead lines to reduce bird casualties.\n“When planning new energy production sites, their locations—and the locations of the power lines connecting them to the grid—must be carefully examined. Better planning that considers the area’s sensitivity and the activity of birds that may be harmed by the lines must be promoted.”\nThe Environment and Climate Change portal is produced in cooperation with the Goldman Sonnenfeldt School of Sustainability and Climate Change at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.

    "text": "La selección chilena agradece el respaldo de los hinchas chilenos que llegaron a Marsella. FOTO: REUTERS.\nEl estadio Vélodrome de Marsella fue el testigo de un nuevo triunfo de la poderosa selección local de Francia. Uno diferente, victoria de 3-2 ante un cuadro de Chile que comienza un nuevo ciclo, esta vez con Ricardo Gareca en la banca.\nPero el partido no fue una celebración exultante para los hinchas locales. Un estadio con 60 mil personas, con muy poca participación de los hinchas locales.\nIncluso, vivieron una pelea aparte con la máxima figura del equipo galo, el talentoso delantero Kylian Mbappé. Cada vez que el capitán de los Bleus tocó la pelota, la rechifla se hizo sentir con fuerza en la principal cancha del puerto galo.\nSu presente en el Paris Saint-Germain, fue el argumento preciso para generar un ambiente hostil para el atacante, como principal referente del archirrival del Olympique. Precisamente, el jugador regresará el domingo a este mismo recinto para jugar el máximo clásico del fútbol francés.\nActitud de la parcialidad local que no cayó nada de bien al técnico de la selección, Didier Deschamps. En la conferencia de prensa después del partido, el exvolante se quejó de los sibidos.\n“No me sorprende, lamentablemente. Todo el mundo conoce la rivalidad de Marsella con el PSG, antes del partido del domingo. No debería suceder, es el equipo francés, es el capitán. Tampoco es todo el estadio. Pero no es específico de Marsella. En otras provincias también pasa. Pero ese no debería ser el caso. Vamos a ver, seré amable: es decepcionante, por decir lo mínimo”, advirtió el exjugador de la Juventus.\nEl ejemplo chileno\nActitud de los galos que también molestó a los propios medios locales. Así quedó claro en la cobertura del diario Le Figaro, el mismo que criticó la actitud general de los asistentes al recinto marsellés.\n“El espectáculo en el Vélodrome no fue de lo mejor, a pesar de cinco goles en el marcador. Pero hay que saludar el calor y los cánticos de la afición chilena la noche del martes”, destacó en su crónica el enviado especial del medio parisino de tiraje nacional.\nDe la misma manera, el periódico más longevo de ese país europeo fue más allá en sus apreciaciones. En el mismo texto elogió la capacidad de resiliencia de los 2 mil simpatizantes visitantes en el estadio focense.\n“En un recinto hostil a su equipo, la afición sudamericana cumplió con su papel, alentando a su equipo de principio a fin. Afortunadamente, estaban allí para hacer un poco de ruido en Marsella”, publicó el diario capitalino.\nAsimismo, describió que “todo comenzó al inicio del día en las calles de Marsella, hasta las afueras del ‘Vel’ antes del partido. Esta es la confirmación de que el fútbol en Sudamérica sigue siendo más que nunca una religión”.\nSiga en El Deportivo",

    "title": "Broadening the Base: How Trump Can Secure Swing Voters and Win the 2024 Election",
    "text": "As the Republican National Convention kicks off Monday, former President Donald Trump's campaign stands at a critical juncture. His core supporters remain steadfast. But winning will require the former president to broaden his appeal to the undecided or voters underwhelmed by his maiden term. He must convince them they will be better off after four more years with Trump.\nStart with swing voters, who proved decisive in Trump's narrow 2020 defeats in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin. Trump needs to tell them he will get them jobs, slash their taxes and make their small businesses flourish. He should remind them the economy boomed under his leadership.\nTrump can attract voters concerned about crime and public safety by promising to detain, punish and deport the tens of thousands of terrorists and drug traffickers illegally crossing our borders to kill and rape civilians and create mayhem generally. But the Aristotelean mean is essential. He needs to promise an end to racial disparities in law enforcement and root out police with a too-ready finger on the gun. Black male voters can be attracted by holding out a Trump welcome sign.\nThe GOP has long treasured the environment, beginning with Teddy Roosevelt's love affair with hunting bison in the Dakotas. Without a flourishing and clean environment, there will be no animals to hunt, no fish to catch. Younger voters, however, are alarmed over climate change that could spike the incidence of drought, hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes and coastal housing disappearing under rising tides. Trump can assuage their fears by promising a moonshot to stop global warming through cold fusion that will not diminish economic riches for his core supporters.\nIn the realm of foreign policy and national security, Trump should showcase the Abraham Accords, which promised to end Israeli-Arab hostility, and incomplete initiatives to end North Korea's growing arsenal of nuclear weapons and rockets. Contrasting success stories with the vacillations of the current administration will project Trump as a global colossus. Additionally, Trump should explain that illegal immigration was reduced to a trickle on his watch but with compassion for women and children fleeing rape and violence.\nTo transcend his base, Trump must electrify all Americans -- the rich and the poor, the old and the young, the tall and the short, the rotund and the skinny. His agenda must be forward-looking, made credible by past awesome accomplishments. Trump should promise limitless jobs, upward social mobility, domestic harmony and fraternity, and an end to politics of personal destruction.\nTrump needs to upgrade his communications skills. His combative, gladiatorial rhetoric alienates the moderate center. Statesmen find a good word to say about everyone. This does not mean abandoning his signature style but blending it with respect for adversaries or doubting Thomases.\nTrump must remember to combine a mix of traditional and digital platforms to maximize his audience reach with messages that command universal applause.\nTrump can't afford to leave out suburban women, minority communities and young voters. That means he must speak to them in their languages and promise to remedy all their grievances, like making students literate and intellectually challenged through school choice and curriculum reform that restores the classics as the centerpiece. Parents will be thrilled and excited. Similarly, minority voters will respond to promises of lucrative incentives for small businesses and entrepreneurs.\nThe GOP convention is a wonderful opportunity for Trump to convince voters across the political spectrum to vote for him. He needs to tell them what they want to hear and to say what he needs to say to save the country from self-ruination by globalists, socialists and atheists.\nIt's a winning hand earmarked by inclusivity, pragmatism and a gentle touch.\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 CREATORS.COM",

    "text": "2 025 is set to be a year jam-packed with exceptional games to play on PC, and whether your setup is bang up to date or not there’ll be something on this list to pique your interest. From frenetic first-person shooters and story-driven RPGs, to action-adventures and co-operative roguelikes, this rundown provides a slice of the best that’s to come.\nAssassin’s Creed Shadows\nFinally capitalising on the appetite for games set in feudal Japan, the latest Assassin’s Creed whisks players back to 16 th century Iga province plus Kyoto, Kobe, and Osaka. In Shadows , you’ll be switching your time between night-loving shinobi Naoe and brute force swordsman Yasuke, the real-life first non-Japanese samurai. A brutal civil war’s culminating phase leaves chaos reigning over the land, yet our two protagonists share common destinies as a new era ushers in.\nMonster Hunter Wilds\nThe thrill of tracking humungous beasts returns in open-world Monster Hunter Wilds , the latest entry in one of gaming’s most glowing genres. In what is sure to be the most visually impressive Monster Hunter yet, relentless storms and dynamic weather shape a dangerous environment; you and your squad of up to three will need to harness all your skills and determination if you’re to successfully slice the game’s freshest creatures into monster meat.\nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater\nWith a leaked release date pin-pointing August 28 th as Snake’s return to Soviet-era swampland, summer can’t come soon enough. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater maintains the original’s narrative paranoia but revamps gameplay via fine-tuning movement and aiming, with quality-of-life improvements in the shape of Snake’s newfound ability to crouch walk ensuring this remake is more than just a healthy dose of hi-res re-decoration.\nDOOM: The Dark Ages\nWhat a way to make DOOM even more heavy metal than to whisk us back to blood-stained medieval hell, witnessing the Doom Slayer’s rage first-hand in this prequel to 2016’s reboot. Watch as he rips and tears through gothic imps and armour-clad cacodemons with guitar shredding ferocity, his shield-come-chainsaw a brutal new addition to an arsenal which, gracefully, eschews primitive weaponry in favour of devastating body mulchers like the Super Shotgun.\nStellar Blade\nCapitalising on Steam’s growing share of the AAA market and buoyed by excellent sales for fellow Asian action-adventure Black Myth: Wukong , Stellar Blade developer Shift Up have confirmed the PS5-exclusive is coming to PC in 2025. Delivering stylish hack-and-slash alongside awesome world design, the Korean effort was a throwback to games like Metal Gear Rising . Still, if you love Sekiro’s dodge-parry swordplay but wish it were more accessible then look no further than Stellar Blade .\nThe Outer Worlds 2\nMore of the same isn’t always a bad thing. Take The Outer Worlds 2 , the follow-up to the 2019 sci-fi RPG outlier. Here, instead of reinventing the wheel, we’ll be treated to new frontiers, deeper options for character customisation, more complex NPC and companions, and a heavy narrative whereby meaningful choices determine the fate of the galaxy, more of the same but more expertly presented.\nNinja Gaiden 4\nThe hack-and-slash trailblazer returns in 2025 with trademark intense yet surgically precise combat demanding skill and strategy to execute. A visually stunning cyberpunk-esque backdrop brings Ninja Gaiden 4 bang up to date too, a vibrant playground for young protégé – and newcomer to the series – Yakumo to revel within. Team Ninja aren’t forgetting the series’ legacy though. Series mainstay Ryu Hayabusa returns, and the pair will embark on a voyage to rid a near-future Tokyo of an ancient curse.\nMafia: The Old Country\nServing as both a mob drama reboot and gritty origin story, Mafia: The Old Country focuses on organised crime’s early days in 1900s Sicily, a countryside of rugged beauty which contrasts with grime-ridden cities, where expertise with stiletto blades is integral to surviving an unforgiving criminal underworld. Swearing allegiance to the Torrisi family, players assume command of antihero Enzo Favara in what Hangar 13 assure us is a period-correct mobster movie-alike, with its eye for authenticity extending beyond handgun detail to including localised Sicilian voice acting.\nDying Light: The Beast\nTransporting you to crystalline country resort Castor Woods in a standalone adventure set a decade plus after events of prior mainline titles, Dying Light: The Beast joins up with Kyle Crane – hero of the first game – after he’s escaped from years of inhumane imprisonment and experimentation. With a score to settle against his captors, Crane finds himself imbued with zombie DNA granting him beast-like power to rip unholy retribution whilst piecing together the vestiges of society.\nElden Ring Nightreign\nFromSoftware assure us they’re not following trends with the upcoming co-operative roguelike spin-off of their genre-defying open-world epic Elden Ring . Elden Ring Nightreign tasks a trio of intrepid explorers with surviving a three day-and-night cycle in the unbridled Limveld, a locale steeped in tough as nails creatures, complex lore, and relics, collecting the latter of which enhancing character skills that can be carried over to subsequent runs.\nCrimson Desert\nOpen world ARPG Crimson Desert has suffered a handful of delays during production, but with all signs pointing to a 2025 release the time is nearly upon us to step into the wonderous continent Pywel and discover if studio Pearl Abyss have managed to seamlessly blend their influence of fifteen different RPGs into one coherent whole. Indeed, Crimson Desert has playfully been dubbed ‘ Assassin’s Fantasy 15: Elder Witcher’s Scrolls of Tsushima’, which at the very least supports the game’s claim of multiple regions, each possessing unique cultures and traditions.\nChernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone\nMuch like The Outer Worlds 2 , survival horror sequel Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone expands on much which many enjoyed in the first game. Promised here is deeper non-linear storytelling, a broader, more interest cast of characters, harsher combat, and – new to the sequel – a vast open world Zone, a place so uncannily alike to the real-life Chornobyl exclusion zone, replete with all manner of physics-bending anomaly to harness or side-step depending on how daring you feel.\nThe Last of Us Part II Remastered\nCoinciding with the TV release of The Last of Us season 2 we have The Last of Us Part II Remastered , a decidedly more brutal depiction of post-apocalyptic America following 2013’s cordyceps outbreak. Ellie’s a little older, she’s fuelled with rage, and hellbent on seeing her revenge mission following a tragic event through to completion no matter the cost. Excellent new characters and a deeply immersive Seattle as backdrop elevate The Last of Us Part II to one of the greatest gaming sequels ever.\nThe First Berserker: Khazan\nHardcore action RPG The First Berserker: Khazan, based on the Dungeon Fighter Online universe, is an origin story focusing on the The First Berzerker named, you guessed it, Khazan set 800 years before DnF. The intricate, engaging combat melding with strategic, hard-won battling looks supreme, but perhaps most eye-catching is the game’s comic book aesthetic which brings a unique feel to the well-trodden fayre of slicing and dicing.\nKilling Floor 3\nIn Killing Floor 3 , you – either on your own or in a squad of up to six players – partake in a last-ditch resistance to save the future of humanity from hordes of bioengineered monsters released by an evil megacorporation. Supporting the frenzied horror action is the chance to earn dosh, unlock skills, and access an awesome arsenal of weaponry which – including shotguns, flamethrowers, and katanas – can be customised via hundreds of mods and gadgets.",

    "title": "Un agrandissement de l’écocentre Rose-Cohen souhaité",
    "text": "Une demande de subvention a été déposée à un programme du Fonds municipal vert (FMV) en ce sens. «On espère obtenir une réponse positive bientôt. Ça apparaît dans le budget, on a commencé l’étude budgétaire. On voit que Rose-Cohen est là. Il y a aussi des investissements prévus à l’écocentre Michel-Ledoux dans un deuxième temps. Il va falloir voir si on a des opportunités de subvention pour ce deuxième écocentre», a commenté la mairesse de Sherbrooke, Évelyne Beaudin, en marge d’un point de presse à l’écocentre Michel-Ledoux. Le programme du FMV permettrait d’obtenir «un prêt à faible taux d’intérêt» de l’ordre de 5,5 millions $. La Ville espère également une subvention de 963 000 $. Le financement auprès de ce programme fédéral permettrait donc d’aller chercher une somme avoisinant les 6,4 millions $, ce qui laisserait la part de la Ville à quelque 1,6 million $. Le projet s’étalerait sur deux ans, selon des documents. «Si on regarde de façon plus large au niveau de l’environnement, il y a les matières résiduelles, mais il y a aussi le traitement des eaux usées. On essaie de résoudre le casse-tête de l’ensemble de nos responsabilités à l’intérieur de notre planification financière des prochaines années», indique la mairesse. «C’est pour agrandir et aussi avoir une opportunité de réemploi. Par exemple, vous faites des travaux chez vous et vous n’aimez plus votre porte, mais elle est quand même capable d’avoir une deuxième vie. Comment développer cette notion-là de réemploi dans l’écocentre?» illustre Ingrid Dubuc, directrice du Bureau de l’environnement à la Ville de Sherbrooke. Déjà en 2022, [la Ville avait estimé que la capacité des deux écocentres](https://www.latribune.ca/2022/10/08/des-ecocentres-mobiles-envisages-a-sherbrooke-392a4a0916952424b06022e11309b65f/) était atteinte: les deux endroits sont très achalandés, Rose-Cohen en tête. Son optimisation est donc jugée plus urgente. En outre, mener des travaux aux deux endroits entraînerait des défis de logistique, puisque cela nécessiterait de couper momentanément l’accès aux deux sites. Le projet lié à l’écocentre Michel-Ledoux, qui viendrait dans un second temps, est évalué à près de 6,6 millions $. Selon une estimation, la facture de la Ville pourrait s’élever à 1,3 million si elle obtient du financement. En 2022, il avait été question de mettre en place deux écocentres mobiles et un point de dépôt des matières, mais ces deux options ont été écartées. «On a évalué tout le spectre des possibles, et c’est vraiment l’agrandissement qui revient comme étant la solution […] Nos deux écocentres sont les mieux positionnés géographiquement pour répondre aux besoins de toute la population.» L’écocentre Michel-Ledoux a ouvert en 2003, dans l’arrondissement de Fleurimont, tandis que Rose-Cohen, dans l’arrondissement des Nations, a ouvert en 2006. En 2006, on comptabilisait 30 000 visites annuelles; en 2023, ce chiffre avait grimpé à 160 000. Depuis 2003, 220 000 tonnes de matières résiduelles ont été valorisées, dont 17 000 tonnes en 2023. «C’est une explosion de la popularité de ces installations-là», observe Mme Beaudin. Bientôt deux millions d’utilisateurs La Ville a, par ailleurs, annoncé que les écocentres de Sherbrooke accueilleront «leur deux millionième personne utilisatrice» au cours des prochains jours. Les installations sherbrookoises recueillent notamment les matelas et le polystyrène. Les matelas posaient un défi important dans les sites d’enfouissement, en raison de leur taille, a rappelé Mme Dubuc. Des rasoirs… à un obus Cheffe d’équipe des deux écocentres, Marjolaine Bélanger a profité de l’occasion pour faire de la sensibilisation. «Les gens, ce qu’ils ne savent pas, c’est qu’ils se mettent en danger et nous mettent en danger. Petite anecdote: on a déjà eu un obus à l’écocentre Michel-Ledoux. Il n’était pas chargé, mais il a fallu faire venir une équipe de Valcartier.» Elle a rappelé l’importance de faire le tri. Les employés tombent parfois sur des rasoirs, des munitions et des seringues. Les deux installations emploient 15 personnes à l’année; ce nombre grimpe à 25 en période estivale.",

Su enfoque sencillo y su amor por los ingredientes frescos y locales se reflejan en cada una de sus recetas. En esta ocasión, nos sumergiremos en su creación de un plato estrella para las comidas de invierno: la sopa de tomate a la Karlos Arguiñano. Ingredientes El secreto detrás de cualquier buena receta es la elección cuidadosa de los ingredientes. En este caso, Karlos Arguiñano nos recomienda utilizar tomates maduros y de alta calidad. La frescura de los tomates no solo aportará un sabor excepcional, sino también una textura suave y jugosa a nuestro plato. - 1 kg de tomates maduros - 2 cucharadas de aceite de oliva virgen extra - 1 cebolla grande, picada finamente - 2 dientes de ajo, picados - 1 pimiento rojo, cortado en tiras - 1 zanahoria, pelada y cortada en rodajas - Sal y pimienta al gusto - 1 cucharadita de azúcar (opcional, para equilibrar la acidez de los tomates) - Albahaca fresca, para decorar Pasos sencillos - Preparación de los tomates: Comienza pelando los tomates. Para facilitar este paso, puedes sumergirlos en agua hirviendo durante unos segundos y luego transferirlos a un recipiente con agua fría. La piel se desprenderá fácilmente. Una vez pelados, córtalos en trozos medianos. - Sofrito perfecto: En una sartén grande, calienta el aceite de oliva a fuego medio. Añade la cebolla y el ajo picados, y sofríelos hasta que estén dorados y fragantes. Este paso es crucial, ya que el sofrito aportará profundidad y complejidad de sabor a nuestro plato. - Tomates y verduras a la sartén: Incorpora los tomates cortados a la sartén, junto con el pimiento rojo y la zanahoria. Revuelve bien para que todos los ingredientes se mezclen de manera uniforme. Añade sal y pimienta al gusto, y si prefieres un toque menos ácido, puedes agregar una pizca de azúcar. - Cocción a fuego lento: Reduce el fuego a bajo y deja que la mezcla hierva a fuego lento. Cubre la sartén y cocina durante aproximadamente 30-40 minutos, o hasta que los tomates se deshagan y las verduras estén tiernas. Este tiempo de cocción lenta permitirá que los sabores se mezclen a la perfección. - El toque final: Una vez que la mezcla haya alcanzado la consistencia deseada, ajusta el sazón según tus preferencias personales. Puedes agregar más sal, pimienta o incluso un toque extra de aceite de oliva. Sirve el tomate a la Karlos Arguiñano en platos hondos y decora con hojas frescas de albahaca para un toque de frescura. Consejos: - Acompañamientos creativos: Este tomate a la Karlos Arguiñano es versátil y puede ser acompañado con arroz, pasta o pan crujiente. ¡Deja volar tu imaginación y personaliza tu experiencia culinaria! - Toque mediterráneo: Si quieres intensificar los sabores, añade aceitunas negras o alcaparras durante la cocción. Estos ingredientes aportarán un toque mediterráneo auténtico. - Conservación: Esta receta es ideal para hacer grandes cantidades y almacenar en frascos de vidrio. Puedes disfrutar de los sabores del tomate a lo largo de la temporada de invierno. En resumen, la mejor receta de tomate de Karlos Arguiñano es una obra maestra de la cocina reconfortante y llena de sabor. La combinación de ingredientes frescos, el arte del sofrito y la cocción lenta hacen de este plato una opción ideal para las comidas de invierno.
