    "text": "The Gospel Music Association will open a museum and hall of fame in spring 2025 in downtown Nashville. To be called the Dove Center, the facility will take space in a mixed-use building anchored by Lipscomb University’s Spark Campus and which previously housed cafe The Well. The address is [147 Fourth Ave. N.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/147+4th+Ave+N,+Nashville,+TN+37219/@36.1625289,-86.7786969,20z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8864665908ad9287:0x3898b55689734587!8m2!3d36.1626887!4d-86.7786332!16s%2Fg%2F11bw40dvk1?entry=ttu) The nonprofit recently released a video with some images and basic details of the future cultural facility. An image shows multiple spaces, including those to accommodate a Dove Awards Theater, a stage and offices. In addition, the Dove Center — with a [main entrance](https://www.google.com/maps/@36.1620926,-86.7786959,3a,75y,14.59h,102.85t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sRo9Az5PNaLE6fLrv1dJCYg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DRo9Az5PNaLE6fLrv1dJCYg%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D64.437096%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) to face Commerce Street — will feature themed spaces such as Lift Your Voice, Creating for a Higher Power and Divine Inspiration. Jackie Patillo, GMA president, could not be reached for comment. \"Developed to preserve the history legacy of our past, support the impact of today's artists, and plant seeds for the future, we believe the Dove Center will be a ... key part of the GMA's mission to expose, promote and celebrate the gospel through music,\" Patillo says in the video. To date, the Gospel Music Association has offered no permanent museum and hall of fame facility, though its website references a hall of fame and event space, started in 1971, located in Music Row. No address is given. An LLC affiliated with Nashville commercial real estate company Eakin Partners owns the building, which also includes a parking garage. The company paid $6.65 million for the modernist structure in 2009, Metro records show. According to Eakin Partners, the GMA will sublease the space from Lipscomb. Jason Holwerda, a partner with the local office of Orlando, Fla.-based Foundry Commercial, represented the GMA in the lease deal. Founded in 1964 by the late J.D. Sumner, the GMA operates its headquarters at 4012 Granny White Pike. The association's hall of fame members include Johnny Cash, Aretha Franklin, Amy Grant, Dolly Parton, Elvis Presley, Michael W. Smith, the Fisk Jubilee Singers and The Winans. In 2017, Lipscomb launched its first graduate business classes via the university’s Spark initiative. The 20,100-square-foot space is located on the main level of the building's southeast corner (and in a space adjacent to the future GMA facility). Spark launched in Cool Springs in November 2012 and ceased operations in Williamson County in 2022 (read [here](https://www.nashvillepost.com/business/development/lipscomb-will-not-renew-lease-on-spark-cool-springs-center/article_cc42932c-fc9c-5569-be68-ccf12bfe86eb.html)). Downtown is home to five music museums: the Country Music Museum and Hall of Fame, the Johnny Cash Museum, the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum, the National Museum of African American Music and the Patsy Cline Museum. The Glen Campbell Museum closed earlier this year and will relocate, according to its website, to a space for which the address has not yet been announced. A downtown museum and bar devoted to George Jones closed in 2021.

    "title": "Warm weather wreaks havoc on some B.C. ski hills as lack of snow leaves trails barren",
    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open. Fewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions. Warmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan. In Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas. On Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain. Warm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each. Mount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow. James Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season. \"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said. \"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\" Apex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls. Shalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow. \"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\" At Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open. Several resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit. \"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled. Environment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland. Proctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\" He said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior. But Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations. \"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.

    "text": "Nicoletta morta senza un perché: «Manca il referto dell’autopsia»\nLa 24enne di Orgosolo deceduta a Cagliari dopo le dimissioni dal pronto soccorso. Parla l’avvocato: «In ospedale gestione pessima e negligente, lo dimostreremo»\nOrgosolo Rimane una morte misteriosa, quella di Nicoletta Manconi, la studentessa di Medicina di 24 anni di Orgosolo. Ad oltre un anno dal decesso avvenuto il 25 settembre del 2023 nell’appartamento dove la ragazza viveva a Cagliari, non si conosce il perché. Una delle tante stranezze di questa vicenda tragica che ha strappato alla famiglia una ragazza piena di vita e di sogni, è il fatto che ancora non si conoscano gli esiti dell’autopsia disposta dalla Procura pochi giorni dopo la morte.\nRisposte che non dovrebbero essere complesse e che di norma arrivano in sei-otto mesi. Questa volta non sta andando così, non sono bastati 15 mesi per mettere nero su bianco le risultanze di quell’esame autoptico compiuto dal medico legale. Cruciali per l’esito dell’inchiesta, che al momento conta un solo indagato, il medico del Santissima Trinità in quel momento in servizio al pronto soccorso dell’ospedale del quartiere di Is Mirrionis. La famiglia della ragazza pretende giustizia e quelle risposte che tardano ad arrivare. Per fare luce su una vicenda con ancora troppi punti oscuri, i Manconi sono assistiti dall’avvocato Mauro Intagliata (con studio a Reggio Emilia e Nuoro). E si attendono riscontri da un’inchiesta che in queste settimane ha avuto un’attesa accelerata: «Abbiamo deciso di depositare una memoria difensiva che rimarcasse alcuni passaggi preoccupanti nella gestione della paziente, questo ha provocato un cambio di tempistica da parte della Procura che ha sostituito il pubblico ministero titolare della prima parte dell’inchiesta – sottolinea l’avvocato Intagliata, che ribadisce il concetto con ancora più forza –. Sono stati incaricati due nuovi medici specialisti per arrivare alla conclusione della perizia autoptica che è l’atto di indagine più importante». Purtroppo oggi nessuno potrà restituire la figlia ai due genitori di Orgosolo, ma almeno conoscere nei dettagli cosa è accaduto quella maledetta giornata di fine settembre, quando la ragazza si è sentita male forse per un’intossicazione alimentare, ma siamo sempre nel campo delle ipotesi, e una volta allertati i paramedici con un’ambulanza è arrivata al Pronto soccorso dell’ospedale Santissima trinità.\nLì le è stato diagnosticato un codice giallo ed è stata dimessa con lo stesso triage per una “gastrite acuta”, malgrado la studentessa non smettesse di vomitare e accusasse forti dolori. «La gestione della paziente è stata pessima. Gli esami emogas effettuati all’ingresso dimostravano una gravissima situazione della salute della ragazza, che andava immediatamente ricoverata per analisi più approfondite – continua il legale –. Purtroppo non è stato così e la gestione imprudente, negligente e imperita del medico del pronto soccorso ha contribuito a creare questa gravissima situazione degenerata con il decesso della ragazza. Una morte che si poteva evitare. E su questo fronte, preciso che ci stiamo impegnando a dimostrarlo supportati da dati oggettivi e scientifici».\nPoi l’avvocato Mauro Intagliata aggiunge: «Troppa negligenza e superficialità nell’operato dei sanitari sia in fase diagnostica che terapeutica. Non ci spieghiamo come mai non sia stato mai eseguito un esame ecografico che avrebbe consentito la visualizzazione del quadro addominale soprattutto alla luce dei parametri di laboratori ottenuti, che erano continuo a dire in gran parte alterati».\nLa memoria difensiva si conclude con una frase che appare una sentenza: «Sono rilevabili censure in tutti i momenti della degenza in Pronto soccorso, della accettazione in triage, alla raccolta dei dati anamnestici, alla esecuzione dell’esame obiettivo fino alla somministrazione della terapia. La formulazione della diagnosi non è supportata da dati clinico strumentali e specialistici con conclusione di ingiustificata precoce dimissione».\nPrimo piano\nLe nostre iniziative\nL’enciclopedia dei nomignoli\nEcco tutti i soprannomi dei paesi segnalati dai nostri lettori\ndi Salvatore SantoniLe storie a metà",

    "text": "BUSINESS\nIf required, trainees can avail of accommodation at the Employee Care Centre in Mysore until their departure date. Check details below:\nInfosys news: Indian IT major Infosys has reportedly terminated more trainees from its Mysuru campus. The IT major has laid off around 30-45 trainees on March 26 after they failed to pass internal assessments, Moneycontrol reported, quoting sources. The decision comes just two months after the company terminated 350-odd trainees from the campus. These trainees were on-boarded after a delay of over 2.5 years.\nBut this time, the Bengaluru-based company is offering an alternative career path to the affected trainees, including 12 weeks of training for potential roles in Infosys Business Process Management (BPM). Additionally, Infosys said it will sponsor the training for those who opt for the BPM course. “Further to the announcement of the results of your final assessment attempt, please be informed that you have not met the qualifying criteria in the 'Foundation skills training program' despite the additional preparation time, doubt-clearing sessions, and several mock assessments opportunities,” emails sent to trainees read.\nFor those unwilling to take the BPM pathway, the company will arrange transport from Mysuru to Bangalore and a standard travel allowance to their hometown. If required, trainees can avail of accommodation at the Employee Care Centre in Mysore until their departure date. For those who want to leave the campus, the company has asked affected trainees to submit their travel and accommodation preferences by March 27, 2025. Infosys is India’s second-largest IT services company, with a market cap of Rs 6.65 lakh crore. The share of the company closed at Rs 1,605 on Thursday.\nREAD | Meet man who once led Elon Musk's company, has Rs 32579 crore net worth, now laying off over 900 employees from...

    "text": "SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California. The 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared. “I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said. He was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors. It would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found. “So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled. It was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost. “I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.” The problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going. By the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report. The search was on then. “Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said. Lukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal. “‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.” But on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help. The Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location. A K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family. “Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.” Fortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.
