    "text": "Air Canada offre 32,5 % à ses agents de bord pour éviter la grève\nAir Canada vient de mettre sur la table une augmentation de salaire globale de 32,5 % sur quatre ans à ses agents de bord afin d’éviter une grève.\nLe transporteur aérien augmenterait dès la première année la rémunération totale, incluant les avantages sociaux et les primes, d'environ 20 %, rapporte l’agence Bloomberg.\nComme demandé par le syndicat, Air Canada accepterait aussi de rémunérer les agents de bord pour une partie du temps passé au sol.\nMardi matin, le syndicat annonçait que les 10 000 membres du personnel des agents de bord d’Air Canada avaient voté à 99,7% en faveur de la grève.\nCet arrêt de travail pourrait être effectif à partir du 16 août ce qui inquiète les utilisateurs puisque la compagnie aérienne pourrait être forcée de réduire ses opérations et même d'annuler des vols quelques jours avant cette date.\nLa présidente du syndicat Natasha Stea affirmait sur les ondes de LCN mardi que son groupe avait bon espoir d’en venir à une entente avant le 16 août ce qui éviterait à des centaines de milliers de voyageurs de bousiller leurs plans.\nAir Canada effectue près de 700 vols par jour pour environ 130 000 passagers.",

He also sent his apostolic blessing to all the inhabitants of Valencia. On Thursday evening, a fire broke out in an apartment high-rise in a residential area of the city. The entire building was quickly engulfed in flames due to strong winds, and firefighters worked throughout the night. Some reports are indicating that the cladding on the building may have been highly flammable and contributed to the fire spreading so quickly. The official death toll is at nine people (earlier reports said 10), with 14 injured (including 6 firefighters) and around 14 still missing. Among the dead is a family, including the mom and dad, a toddler and a newborn.",

    "text": "Apple’s Foray into High-End Mac Gaming A Glimpse into the Future Introduction: In recent years, Apple has made significant strides in redefining its role in the gaming industry. Historically, Mac computers were not considered the go-to choice for serious gamers, with Windows-based PCs dominating the market. However, recent developments suggest that Apple is gearing up to change this narrative. Rumors and industry speculation point to Apple’s intentions to enter the high-end gaming arena with a focus on Mac devices, signaling a potentially transformative shift in the world of Mac gaming. The Current State of Mac Gaming: While Macs have long been favored for their sleek design, user-friendly interface, and robust hardware, the gaming capabilities of these devices have often taken a backseat. Windows PCs have been the preferred choice for gamers, owing to their compatibility with a wider range of games and superior graphics performance. However, Apple has been gradually working to bridge this gap, introducing features like Metal graphics API and supporting technologies like eGPUs to enhance gaming experiences on Mac. Rumors and speculations: Recent reports and industry insiders suggest that Apple is now eyeing the high-end gaming market with a dedicated focus on Mac devices. Speculations point to the company developing a new line of Macs designed specifically for gaming, with hardware configurations that rival or even surpass those of traditional gaming PCs. This move is seen as a strategic response to the growing demand for high-performance gaming experiences on the Mac platform.",

    "text": "A man who tried to save three men trapped in a submerged 4×4 vehicle said they were “swept away” as they attempted to cross a river. Emergency services including police, ambulance and a helicopter attended a location on the River Esk near Glaisdale shortly before midday on Thursday. A 4×4 was recovered from the river by the fire service just after 3pm and three men found inside had died, North Yorkshire Police said. Chris Ford, who lives nearby, told the PA news agency the men were part of an off-roading group when they crossed a ford on Rake Lane. The river, swollen by heavy rain, swept them away and carried them around 400 yards downstream, he said. Emergency services have been dealing with a serious incident on Thursday (28 December) involving a 4×4 vehicle in the River Esk near Glaisdale on the North York Moors 🚨 Three men sadly died at the scene. More information is available here ⬇️ [https://t.co/KgxPhHATO4] [pic.twitter.com/AvDT3TiqCk] — North Yorkshire Police (@NYorksPolice) [December 28, 2023] It came as Storm Gerrit caused flooding and travel chaos across the country throughout Wednesday and Thursday. Mr Ford, a firewood salesman, was called to the scene to help recover the vehicle with his tractor and found it fully submerged beneath the water, he said. He and two others used tractors to pull the 4×4 on to the riverbank, he said. Police said another man, who attempted to help those trapped in the car, was pulled from the river and needed medical treatment. Mr Ford told PA: “There was a ford they were going over and they were swept down 400 yards. “They were part of an off-road club. “I went down with my tractor. There was a couple of vehicles – one parked up. “You couldn’t see the (other) vehicle. It was 3ft beneath the water. “I helped get it out on to the riverbank with three other tractors.” Two other locals, Rosie and Andrew Dale, said they were with Mr Ford when he got the call to help. They said they saw several 4×4 vehicles pass their home in the direction of the ford shortly before the incident. Mrs Dale said “nobody local” would attempt to cross the ford in the current conditions. The area is popular with 4×4 drivers, she said, adding: “In the summer you get 10 of them at a time.” A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: “Localised conditions across our area are making driving hazardous. “Roads are particularly badly affected around the River Esk, to the north of the county, as we have seen with the tragic incident near Glaisdale. “There was another incident at nearby Houlsyke at 12.49pm when a car got stuck in flood water and another at Kirby Wiske in Hambleton at 2.35pm. “Thankfully, the occupants of both vehicles were brought to safety. “The key advice is to consider whether your journey is necessary. “Please avoid driving through any kind of standing or moving flood water if you possibly can.” Witnesses to the incident at Glaisdale are urged to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, option 4, quoting reference NYP-28122023-0146.",

In 32 minutes of play, Wembanyama pulled off a self-alley-oop from just inside the free-throw line, dished out another to his teammate Jeremy Sochan, played lock-down defense, and was the Spurs' leading scorer on the afternoon.\nHere's a look at some of the best moments from his performance:\nWEMBY OFF THE GLASS TO HIMSELF\n- NBA (@NBA)\nPutting on a show in his home country[pic.twitter.com/wEEwDpzVkM][January 23, 2025]\nthis sequence at the end of the third. he checks every box.\n- Rob Perez (@WorldWideWob)[pic.twitter.com/tucMFgZWIy][January 23, 2025]\nWembanyama finished San Antonio's win over Indiana with 30 points on 13-for-21 shooting, 11 rebounds, six assists, five blocks, and one steal.\nNot too shabby.\nThe Spurs and Pacers conclude the 2025 Paris Games on Saturday from France's Accor Arena.

    "text": "Photo by Dima Solomin Will This Change Really ‘Restore Free Expression’ on Meta? By Movieguide® Contributor\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently announced that the platform is getting rid of its fact-checking program in a bid to “restore free expression” to social media sites like Instagram and Facebook.\nIn a video, Zuckerberg expressed disappointment that “governments and legacy media have pushed to censor more and more.”\n“After Trump first got elected in 2016 the legacy media wrote nonstop about how misinformation was a threat to democracy,” he explained . “We tried in good faith to address these concerns without becoming the arbiters of truth. But fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they created, especially in the U.S.”\nZuckerberg continued, “We’ve reached a point where it’s just too many mistakes and too much censorship. The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritizing speech. So we’re gonna get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies and restoring free expression on our platforms.”\nInstead, Meta plans to implement “a community-driven system similar to X’s Community Notes,” per NBC News.\nElsewhere in the video, Zuckerberg revealed the company will “eliminate some content policies around immigration, gender and other hot-button issues and refocus its automated moderation systems on…‘high severity violations,’ relying on users to report other violations.”\nIt was also announced that Facebook will move its trust and safety and content moderation team from California to Texas.\nThis news comes amid a series of legal issues Meta and Zuckerberg have been facing. In 2024, Meta was found to owe Ireland’s Data Protection Commission over $100 million for neglecting to protect the privacy and passwords of users in a 2019 data breach.\nREAD MORE: META FACES MASSIVE FINE FOR PRIVACY VIOLATION\nIn a collection of 25 lawsuits holding Meta accountable for causing social media addiction in children, Zuckerberg was not found personally liable. However, the people behind the filings plan to continue fighting the company. READ MORE: IS META CEO MARK ZUCKERBERG LIABLE FOR CAUSING SOCIAL MEDIA ADDICTION?",
