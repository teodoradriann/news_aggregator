Об этом 7 мая сообщил Telegram-канале Amur Mash.Пока вода бежит из крана, кажется, будто она чистая. Если же набрать ее в кружку, то выглядит так, будто там заваренный черный чай.\nОтмечается, что месяц назад в городе уже была подобная проблема с водоснабжением. В деле разбиралась прокуратура. Несмотря на это, история повторяется.\nКак передавало ИА Регнум , в сентябре 2024 года многие жители Кабардино-Балкарии отравились некачественной водой. За медицинской помощью с признаками отравления обратились 212 человек . В 70% жалобы поступали от детей и подростков.\nСреди обращений на прямую линию президенту РФ Владимиру Путину , прошедшей в декабре, вопрос о качестве водопроводной воды был одним из наиболее популярных .\n\",\"author\":\"ИА REGNUM\",\"dateline\":\"Приморский край, Дальневосточный ФО, Дальнереченск\",\"image\":\"https://cdn.regnum.ru/uploads/pictures/news/2022/11/29/regnum_picture_16697496925281_big.jpg\",\"publisher\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"ИА REGNUM\",\"telephone\":\"+74956458075\",\"email\":\"info@regnum.ru\",\"image\":\"https://regnum.ru/regnum_logo.png\",\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"url\":\"https://regnum.ru/regnum_logo.png\",\"width\":60,\"height\":60},\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"streetAddress\":\"г.

    "text": "O presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) chorou nesta quinta-feira (15) ao relembrar os 580 dias que passou na carceragem da Polícia Federal em Curitiba . Em um discurso durante o evento de reinauguração das operações da fábrica de Fertilizantes Araucária Nitrogenados S.A., o petista falou sobre a sua experiência na prisão e fez declarações contundentes [sobre os envolvidos em seu processo judicial.](https://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/politica/2019-11-08/primeiro-ato-de-lula-apos-ser-solto-sera-em-frente-a-pf-de-curitiba.html) Lula afirmou que foi \"inteligente\" ao se entregar à Polícia Federal, e fez críticas severas ao ex-juiz e atual senador Sérgio Moro (União Brasil-PR), chamando-o de \"insignificante\". O presidente também acusou o ex-deputado Deltan Dallagnol (Novo-PR) e outros procuradores de formarem uma \"quadrilha dentro do Ministério Público \" que, segundo ele, atuou em seu processo. “Eu tomei a decisão, e foi a mais sábia que eu tomei, de falar: ‘eu vou me entregar na Polícia Federal e vou lá para dentro’. Vou perto daquele juiz insignificante. Vou perto daqueles procuradores da República que faziam parte de uma quadrilha no Ministério Público. Eu vou lá para provar a minha inocência”, disse, visivelmente emocionado. A prisão de Lula começou em abril de 2018, após condenação a 12 anos de reclusão por corrupção passiva e lavagem de dinheiro no caso tríplex do Guarujá, julgado por Moro durante a Operação Lava Jato. O chefe do Executivo foi liberado em novembro de 2019, após 580 dias de detenção, quando o Supremo Tribunal Federal determinou a devolução das ações para a 1ª Instância. Isso permitiu que Lula concorresse à presidência em 2022, eleição que venceu. Lula e sua recordação Durante seu discurso, Lula compartilhou uma recordação pessoal sobre sua experiência na prisão. “Tem gente que consegue gravar uma música que gosta para o resto da vida. Pois a minha música eram 3 ‘bom dias’: de manhã, de tarde e de noite. Todo santo dia, durante os 580 dias, fazendo frio, calor ou chovendo, sendo domingo ou feriado prolongado, eu via da cela em que eu estava o pessoal cantar parabéns, comemorar meu aniversário, e aquilo marcou a minha vida”, concluiu.

    "title": "Surge of Russian tourists in Sanya: China's new symbol of openness - People's Daily Online",
    "text": "This aerial photo taken on Aug. 30, 2023 shows the scenery of Sanya Bay in Sanya, south China's Hainan Province. (Xinhua/Pu Xiaoxu) A recent influx of Russian tourists to Sanya, South China's Hainan Province, with many sharing their travel photos and videos on social media, has led to widespread discussion among netizens. This phenomenon highlights the growing popularity and international appeal of Sanya as a major tropical tourist destination. From January to May 2024, Sanya received 38,000 Russian tourists, making it the top source of inbound visitors and 2.6 times the total number of Russian tourists for all of 2023, according to a report from the Sanya Tourism Board sent to the Global Times on Thursday. Many Russians posted pictures on social media to express their love for Sanya's natural beauty. \"We love to sunbathe and swim in the sea while enjoying the beautiful scenery,\" a Russian tourist said in an interview video provided by the Sanya Tourism Board. Outside the beach views, seeking traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is popular among foreign tourists. Three Russian tourists visited Sanya to seek TCM treatments for their chronic pain. After two sessions, all three reported notable improvements and expressed their gratitude in a letter to the hospital, commending TCM's effectiveness and the dedicated team at the Sanya Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The Sanya city government has also made significant improvements in international tourism services. Since March 2024, Sanya has introduced a mobile payment app to make transactions easier for international tourists in Hainan, along with the \"Visit Sanya\" online consultation and complaint service on overseas platforms like X and Facebook. Additionally, high-end hotels now offer multilingual menus, and major tourist attractions have added Russian and English signage to better serve visitors, Albert Yip, the director general of the Sanya Tourism Board told the Global Times on Thursday. \"There weren't that many Russian tourists six months ago. I've been seeing more and more of these foreign faces. Sometimes, when I go to malls or bars with friends, we meet young Russians who actively start conversations with us,\" Ye Zhuyun, a local resident, told the Global Times on Thursday. \"I'm happy and proud because the scenery and cultural atmosphere of my hometown are appreciated by people from different parts of the world. Their arrival has brought a multicultural feel to Sanya, making it more international,\" she added. \"The visa-free policy, the increasing flights between Sanya and Russian-speaking regions, and the tropical scenery, which contrasts sharply with high-latitude areas, are the main reasons attracting tourists from the Russian-speaking world. \" Wang Jinwei, a professor at the School of Tourism Sciences at Beijing International Studies University, told the Global Times on Thursday. \"The increase in international tourists, including those from Russia, reflects the growing extent of our opening-up. Sanya serves as an excellent window for showcasing China to the world,\" Wang added. Sanya's tropical coastal resources, visa-free policy, leisure sports, TCM, and ethnic cultural attractions have long attracted the Russian-speaking market. Since July 2023, Sanya has opened international flights to several Russian-speaking destinations, including Almaty, Astana, Moscow and Krasnoyarsk, according to the Sanya Tourism Board. Since September 2023, the implementation of a visa-free policy between China and Russia has facilitated increased cultural and trade exchanges. Building on this, Hainan expanded this policy for citizens of 59 countries to include business, visits, family reunions, medical treatment, exhibitions, and sports events, allowing stays of up to 30 days since February 9.

    "text": "Jenna Zu viel Naschen hat bekanntlich unangenehme Nebenwirkungen. Auf einigen Produkten steht daher der Warnhinweis „kann bei übermäßigem Verzehr abführend wirken“. Doch der „übermäßige Verzehr“ beginnt oft viel früher, als Sie denken. Deshalb schlägt die Verbraucherzentrale Hamburg jetzt Alarm: In vielen Produkten stecken so viele Zuckerersatzstoffe (z. B. Maltit oder Sorbit), dass schon kleine Mengen abführend wirken können, gerade bei empfindlichen Personen. ► Zuckerersatz steckt in vielen Süßigkeiten, weil er süßt, aber weniger Kalorien liefert, den Blutzucker kaum beeinflusst und zahnschonender ist. Außerdem erlaubt er Herstellerangaben wie „zuckerfrei“, die sich gut vermarkten lassen. Bei einer Stichprobe von 16 Süßigkeiten , darunter Gummibärchen, Riegel und Minzbonbons, lag der Gehalt an Zuckeraustauschstoffen in allen Fällen über zehn Prozent. Ab dieser Schwelle muss laut Gesetz auf die abführende Wirkung hingewiesen werden. Doch genau das geschieht häufig nicht deutlich genug, kritisiert die Verbraucherzentrale. Spitzenreiter der Stichprobe: die zuckerfreien Minzbonbons „Tictac Two Fresh & Mild Spearmint Flavor“. Sie bestehen zu 97 Prozent aus Sorbit, also fast nur Zuckeralkohol. Auch ein getesteter Riegel kam auf 17 Prozent. Bei manchen Riegeln reiche schon die Hälfte für die abführende Wirkung aus. Bei den Weingummis von De Bron genügen laut Verbraucherschützern nur drei Stück. „Solche Mengen versteht niemand unter einem übermäßigen Verzehr“, sagt Jana Fischer von der Verbraucherzentrale. Lediglich zwei Fruchtgummi-Packungen gaben klar an, wie viele Stück ohne Risiko gegessen werden dürfen: jeweils fünf Stück.",

    "title": "Manuel Barreto: “Buscan condicionar a los árbitros en contra de Universitario”",
    "text": "En el último compromiso por el Torneo Clausura, [Universitario de Deportes empató 1-1 ante Atlético Grau](https://depor.com/noticias/universitario-de-deportes/); sin embargo, los focos de atención se quedaron con Micke Palomino, árbitro del encuentro, quien expulsó a Horacio Calcaterra tras una dura falta contra Rafael Guarderas. Esta sanción no fue tomada de la mejor manera en tienda crema por lo que [Jean Ferrari](https://depor.com/noticias/jean-ferrari/) -administrador del club- alzó la voz para afirmar que “siempre pasan cosas raras”. En ese sentido, [la Comisión Nacional de Árbitros (CONAR) emitió un comunicado](https://depor.com/futbol-peruano/descentralizado/universitario-conar-respondio-a-jean-ferrari-sobre-declaraciones-sobre-arbitraje-en-liga-1-clasico-noticia/?ref=depr/) rechazando las declaraciones del mandamás de Ate. En medio de todo ese contexto, y a un día del clásic, [Manuel Barreto](https://depor.com/noticias/manuel-barreto/) - gerente deportivo de la institución- también opinó de lo sucedido. “Es clara la campaña mediática que vivimos en el Apertura en contra del arbitraje. Lo que buscan hacer es condicionar a los árbitros en contra nuestra”, declaró Manuel Barreto para GOLPERU. El exfutbolista también se mostró inconforme con el desarrollo del arbitraje en los últimos partidos. Para Manuel Barreto no todo es negativo porque Universitario se quedó con el Torneo Apertura y ahora tiene el reto de conseguir el Clausura (así se consagrarían con el bicampeonato). El gerente deportivo del club merengue contó que tiene constantes conversaciones con Fabián Bustos (DT), quien se ha mostrado contento con el plantel que se formó para el presente curso. “Veo muy bien al equipo, con mucha energía y entusiasmo. Fabián Bustos está muy conforme con el plantel que tenemos este 2024″, apuntó. Para el Clausura, Universitario de Deportes sumó a Gustavo Dulanto en defensa y también a Gabriel Costa, procedente de Alianza Lima. ¿Qué dijo Jean Ferrari sobre el arbitraje en la Liga 1? En primer lugar, Jean Ferrari fue contundente al asegurar que “previo a un clásico siempre pasan cosas raras”. “Como yo digo, las casualidades en el fútbol no existen y hay que tomar las cosas como tal. El viernes será un partido, seguramente, duro, difícil como todo clásico, porque se paraliza el país. Será un choque importante porque, si bien es la tercera fecha, se van a jugar, seguramente, muchas cosas”. Luego, fue consultado por la actuación del árbitro Micke Palomino en el empate contra los ‘albos’, y dijo lo siguiente: “Estamos cansados con el tema arbitral, solo esperamos que cumplan un buen trabajo este viernes. Esperemos que en la semana se hable de fútbol y no como algunos que ya comenzaron a polemizar y mandar desde afuera sus mensajitos”. Ante este panorama, la CONAR comunicó que está en desacuerdo con lo dicho por el administrador crema. Además, detallaron que esta no es una situación nueva porque “desde torneo anteriores, realiza declaraciones en contra del arbitraje”. Desde la entidad, apuntaron que este tipo de situaciones generan “un clima de hostilidad que no permite el buen desarrollo de la competición”. “La Comisión Nacional de Árbitros siempre actúa atendiendo a los representante de los clubes a través de reuniones cuando la solicitan, donde se analiza junto a ellos las situaciones de juego, incluyendo los audios y vídeos del Var con total transparencia”, añadió en el comunicado. Por último complementó que “buscamos la tranquilidad deportiva que amerita el torneo”. ¿A qué hora juegan Universitario vs. Alianza Lima por el Clausura 2024? Yendo a la Liga 1, el clásico de los clásicos del fútbol peruano entre [Universitario de Deportes y Alianza Lima](https://depor.com/futbol-peruano/descentralizado/cuando-juega-universitario-vs-alianza-lima-fecha-hora-y-canal-del-clasico-del-torneo-clausura-2024-por-golperu-y-pelota-libre-tv-noticia/) se jugará este viernes 26 de julio a partir de las 8:30 de la noche en países como Perú, Colombia y Ecuador. En Argentina, Brasil y Uruguay, el choque se podrá ver desde las 10:30 p.m. Mientras que en Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay y Venezuela, la pelota empezará a rodar desde las 9:30 p.m. ¿En qué canales pasan el el Clásico del Torneo Clausura 2024?
