    "text": "Aaron Rodgers is ready.\nJust days before his 20th NFL season and nearly one year removed from a ruptured Achilles tendon, the Jets quarterback spoke excitedly Thursday about opening the season Monday night against the 49ers.\n“I have a lot of pride in my performance,” Rodgers said. “When I take the field, I expect greatness because I’ve done it before and that’s kind of standard to hold myself to.”\nThat’s what the Jets are counting on. The organization has been waiting to see Rodgers’ greatness for a while now. The Jets acquired Rodgers in a trade with the Packers back in April 2023. The expectations were high going into last season and then crashed to the ground when Rodgers’ left Achilles snapped on the fourth play of the season opener against the Bills.\n3 Aaron Rodgers throws a pass during Jets practice on Sept. 5, 2024. Bill Kostroun for the NY Post Rodgers missed the entire 2023 season despite an attempted December comeback. Now, the Jets are hoping to finally see what the four-time MVP can do for their team. Rodgers joked Thursday that he may feel a little joy once the fifth snap of Monday’s game comes.\n“I mean, there might be a little smirk after the fourth [snap],” Rodgers said. “I don’t know. We’ll see.”\nThe Jets enter this season with high hopes. They believe they are a Super Bowl contender and that is largely because of Rodgers’ presence. The 40-year-old has looked outstanding in training camp. But now he has to face a live defense. The 49ers are the defending NFC champions and are expected to again be one of the best teams in football.\nExplore More Everything you need to know about the NFL kickoff rule change for 2024: ‘So much more exciting’ NFL crystal ball predictions for the 2024 season: Playoffs, Super Bowl picks 2024 Super Bowl predictions: Why Eagles and Jets are best bets to win it all Rodgers said he learned a lesson from former Packers coach Mike McCarthy about the difficulty of dealing with success.\n“I think what he meant was, he just can’t ride the highs too high and then the whole world’s crashing down after a tough game,” Rodgers said. “Regardless of what happens on Monday, we win the headline’s going to be, you know, we’re going to Super Bowl; we lose, same old Jets. So I think we need to get away from some of those outside themes and trust the program.”\nRodgers delivered a similar message at the end of last year after the Jets went 7-10 with backups Zach Wilson, Tim Boyle and Trevor Siemian at quarterback. Rodgers told the Jets to “flush the B.S.” but then made offseason headlines when he was reportedly a vice presidential candidate and then skipped the team’s mandatory mini-camp to take a trip to Egypt.\n3 Jets center Joe Tippmann (66) hugs quarterback Aaron Rodgers (8) during practice on Sept. 5, 2024. Bill Kostroun for the NY Post Those offseason storylines are in the past now and Rodgers’ teammates and coaches have done nothing but heap praise on him this summer.\n“He’s an unbelievable teammate,” Jets coach Robert Saleh said. “The guys in the locker room love him. They look up to him. They seek advice from him. I noticed it the other day. I shot him a text. I think it’s fascinating the way he interacts with the D line. Just the way he interacts with everybody. He’s the ultimate teammate. I think his leadership has been invaluable to the organization.”\nSaleh has spoken about not just how well Rodgers has thrown the ball this summer, but also his movement skills.\n3 Aaron Rodgers smiles as he speaks to reporters before Jets practice. Bill Kostroun for the NY Post “I think he’s in a great place, not just mentally but physically. He looks awesome,” Saleh said. “He’s not a 40-year-old quarterback. He’s going to be just fine.”\nRodgers has long thrived on proving his critics wrong. Now, he has a chance to do something unprecedented and return from an Achilles tear to play quarterback at 40 years old.\n“I’ve always kind of played with something on my shoulder,” Rodgers said. “You got to, you know, manufacture things from time to time. But yeah, I mean, it kind of goes back to the prove it. Who would I need to prove it to? Just myself at this point.”\nGet the insider's view on Gang Green Sign up for Inside the Jets by Brian Costello, a weekly Sports+ exclusive.\nThank you Enter your email address Please provide a valid email address.\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\nEnjoy this Post Sports+ exclusive newsletter!\nCheck out more newsletters Rodgers said “of course” when asked if the Super Bowl is the goal this season and then sent another message to his teammates about staying steady.\n“We can’t ride these waves of emotion or frustration or outside narratives or any of these things,” he said. “We got to keep this thing very tight. You know, we can’t have any leaks or people jumping ship. We’ve got to realize it’s going to be a long season.”",

    "text": "OREGON, USA — \"More aggressive and difficult to control\": Those are the words from Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek to describe this upcoming wildfire season. It's expected to be just as bad — if not worse — than what Oregonians experienced last summer.\nOne of the largest fire caches in the state is in Salem, and as you walk through it, it feels more like a Home Depot. The supplies are expected to fly off the shelves by the end of the summer.\nOn Wednesday, Kotek signed a proclamation declaring May as Wildfire Season Awareness Month. The conditions are going to be ripe for what could be another record-breaking year, just like in 2024 when nearly 2 million acres burned.\n\"Oregon received a considerable amount of moisture through this past winter, and our state is benefiting from a strong snowpack in the high country,\" said Kotek.\nThat snowpack is keeping much of the state out of a drought for now, but it will result in overgrowth with vegetation that could present a risk for firefighters.\n\"By July and August, we will experience above-average severity that will culminate in September and October as we reach peak fire danger,\" said Kotek.\nHomeowners can start preparing now, according to Oregon State Fire Marshal Mariana Ruiz-Temple.\n\"Getting the gutters cleaned a lot of time when an ember you can see get into your gutters and that can start a fire,\" said Ruiz-Temple.\nRELATED: Oregon offers free home fire safety assessments ahead of wildfire season. Here's what to know\nThe real concern this summer is going to be in July and August, which are typically the warmest months of the summer. Long-range weather models are already showing above-average temperatures by August across the Pacific Northwest.",

    "text": "La minaccia nel caso in cui gli Hezbollah, alleati dell'Iran, non finiranno di attaccare. TEL AVIV - «Israele non vuole la guerra ma non esiterà a spianare e riportare il Libano \"all'età della pietra\" se gli Hezbollah, alleati dell'Iran, non finiranno di attaccare». Il ministro della Difesa Yoav Gallant dagli Usa è tornato ad ammonire Beirut per una crisi che - secondo molti osservatori - sembra ormai a un passo dal precipizio. Washington lo ha messo in guardia sul fatto che anche una limitata azione di terra in Libano porterebbe al conflitto regionale che coinvolgerebbe anche l'Iran. Un allarme non ignorato dal premier Benjamin Netanyahu che però a sua volta ha avvertito: «L'Iran ci combatte su più fronti, da Hamas agli Houthi, ma vuole rovesciare anche la Giordania e conquistare l'intero Medio Oriente. È una minaccia per tutti». Intanto il Financial Times - sulla base di foto satellitari e analisi di esperti - ha rivelato che negli ultimi mesi Israele avrebbe creato «una striscia di sicurezza» profonda 5 chilometri all'interno del territorio libanese. Lo scopo - per la stessa fonte - è «una zona morta» che tenga lontani gli Hezbollah dal confine con Israele. Secondo un alto funzionario dell'Idf, citato dal quotidiano, \"non si tratta di una zona cuscinetto, ma si vuole solo respingere gli Hezbollah». Israele ha già fatto evacuare circa 60 mila abitanti del nord a ridosso della frontiera, ma il Controllore di Stato Matanyahu Englman ha avvisato che il governo, in caso di guerra, deve assumere «un'azione unificata e ordinata» per spostare la gente. Basti pensare ad esempio a una città importante come Haifa che si trova a pochi chilometri dal confine.",

    "title": "Mustard Roasted Potatoes Recipe",
    "text": "Crispy on the outside, soft and tender on the inside, with the taste of mustard all over, these Mustard Roasted Potatoes MUST be served at your next dinner party.\nTable of Contents\nWhenever I have guests over for dinner on the weekend, I try to include dishes that are a bit unusual. It serves as a challenge to me and a surprise for my guests. Other times I prefer to take the familiar but infuse it with something different. That’s what I did with these roasted potatoes. By combining them with mustard, the fancy-dinner stalwarts have raised their game and have become—dare I say—exotic.\nAdmittedly,\nroasted potatoes need no help from me to be delicious. I love their changing textures: crispy edges give way to creamy insides. I could eat these as a snack and never get sick of them. They’re a step up from my Garlic Roasted Potatoes, as both have garlic, but this recipe has the distinct taste of mustard, which, along with the lemon, garlic, and herbs, turns these taters into something majestic.\nAre Mustard Roasted Potatoes Healthy?\nYes, Mustard Roasted Potatoes are healthy. Potatoes contain calcium, fiber, and iron, and are a great source of carbohydrates (whether this is a good thing depends on your diet). The ingredients are, for the most part, unprocessed, and should be suitable for Whole30, paleo, vegetarian, gluten-free, and Mediterranean diets. But, as always, you should double check with your personal diet and make sure.\nWhat’s So Special About Whole-Grain Mustard?\nWhole-grain mustard actually has a lot going for it. First, there’s the texture. Those grains are present in every bite, providing a delightful crunch. It also bears a more robust flavor compared to other mustards, which can sometimes lack that bite you’re after. Whole-grain mustard is also easy to make, containing few ingredients (mustard seeds, vinegar, water, salt). As a result, I sometimes think of this as a “purer” mustard. It’s also a classier mustard (if there is such a thing) and can be paired with a multitude of meats and cheeses beyond a ballpark hot dog.\nINGREDIENTS\n- 2 lb. potatoes scrubbed\n- 3 tbsp olive oil\n- ½ cup whole-grain mustard\n- ¼ cup butter, melted\n- 3 cloves garlic, crushed\n- 1 tbsp lemon zest\n- 1 tbsp lemon juice\n- 2 sprigs rosemary\n- salt and pepper\nINSTRUCTIONS\nPrep\nPreheat the oven to 350°F. Cut the potatoes into large 2-inch chunks.\nMix\nMix the olive oil, mustard, melted butter, garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, rosemary leaves, and salt and pepper in a large bowl.\nCoat\nAdd the potatoes and, using a spoon, coat them with the mustard mix.\nRoast\nSpread the potatoes out on a baking sheet. Roast in the oven for 40 minutes or until the potatoes are crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside.\nDEVOUR!\nTips & Tricks to Making Perfect Mustard Roasted Potatoes\n- Keep the size of the potato chunks consistent so that they cook at the same rate.\n- Line the baking sheet with parchment paper or spray it with nonstick spray.\n- If you have room, keep the potatoes from touching to ensure consistent cooking and texture.\n- Wash the potatoes with cold water, not hot water. Hot water will activate the starch and is counter to what we want to achieve by washing them in the first place (i.e., rid the potatoes of excess starch).\nFAQs\nFlipping isn’t necessary, especially if your potato pieces were all cut to the same size. If you’re particular about the roasted exterior then, by all means, flip them once halfway through cooking, but the relatively low temperature of the oven should prevent the top side of the potatoes from getting too crispy and leaving the underside under-done.\nSure, they’ll have a similar texture, though stone-ground will be slightly smoother, having had its grains milled. The taste should be close to the same, provided neither mustard added a bunch of other ingredients.\nPotatoes that hold their shape and have a waxy/creamy consistency. I usually reach for Yukon Golds or red potatoes, but fingerlings will also do the trick.\nIt’s not necessary to parboil them (the process of “pre-cooking” food) but boiling them for 8–10 minutes and then getting on with the roasting should guarantee a soft interior without leaving them in the oven too long and burning their outsides.\nVariations\nGarlic Roasted Potatoes: Roasted potatoes infused with lovely garlic, thyme, and parsley. Air-Fryer Roasted Potatoes: The roasted potatoes you love but done in an air fryer for convenience and health. Roasted Sweet Potatoes: Still roasted potatoes but slightly sweeter, creamier, and served with tahini maple. Breakfast Potatoes: Roasted potatoes but with the herbs to make them for the breakfast and brunch set.\nHow To Prep and Store Your Mustard Roasted Potatoes\nLet the potatoes cool completely, then put them in an airtight container in the fridge where they should keep for up to 4 days. To reheat, do them in the microwave or the oven set at 425°F for 10 minutes. As for freezing the potatoes, you can do so, though the texture of the potatoes may suffer. You’re better off finding a use for them before their time in the fridge expires.\nIngredients\n- 2 lb. potatoes scrubbed\n- 3 tbsp olive oil\n- ½ cup whole-grain mustard\n- ¼ cup butter melted\n- 3 cloves garlic crushed\n- 1 tbsp lemon zest\n- 1 tbsp lemon Juice\n- 2 sprigs rosemary\n- salt and pepper\nInstructions\n- Preheat the oven to 350°F.
