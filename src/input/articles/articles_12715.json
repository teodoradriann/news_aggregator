    "text": "Two neurodivergent individuals recently interned at an ice cream manufacturing unit in the city — an experience that, according to those who work with them, helped them become more independent, employable, and better prepared for the real world.\nThe two had prior experience working in the cafe on the campus of Manovikas Kendra, a centre that works with children and individuals with various disabilities, before the institute sent them for the month-long internship this summer.\nThe internship at the ice cream manufacturers included kitchen tasks, rolling and cutting cookies, and packaging work.\nSelf-sufficiency\nThe two men have intellectual disabilities. Internships give individuals with disabilities the opportunity to face challenges in the real world, said Amita Prasad, director, Manovikas Kendra.\n“Our students are used to a familiar setting with known people. An internship in a new place teaches them to respond in unfamiliar environments and interact with new people,” she said. “They also commute on their own, possibly helping ready them for employment and independent living.\"\nMost parents of those with disabilities worry about how their children will manage after them.\n“Every parent wants to raise independent children. But it is important that society also creates a world that is more accepting of them,” said the father of a neurodivergent child.\nPrasad said such internships help them understand workplace dynamics.\nInclusive environment\nAutism Society West Bengal also plans to start internships for its students, but first wants to talk to prospective employers to ensure that the workplaces have inclusive practices.\nInclusive practices include sensitising employees to ensure a neurodivergent person is not teased or bullied.\nThere have been examples of neurodivergent people being compelled to quit their workplaces because of teasing.\nA 26-year-old man with autism who did data entry work had to quit his job because he was constantly teased. He faced cruel and insensitive remarks as well. Co-workers asked him prying, personal questions.\n“Workplaces have to learn to be inclusive. Neurodivergent people have skills that they have to build and work on. They have to work on their communication and coping strategies, but people at the workplace also have to learn inclusiveness,” said Indrani Basu, founder, Autism Society West Bengal.\nBasu said that at a workplace, a neurodivergent person learns to communicate in a neurotypical environment, but should not have to tolerate ragging and abuse.\nWhile some organisations have opened up to people with disabilities, reluctance persists, and the numbers are few.\n“A few organisations are hiring people with disabilities, but the problem is that society is still not accepting enough. The obstacles are in people’s minds,” said Pradipta Kanungo, director, Bloomingdale Academy High School.",

    "text": "St Johnstone FC Dare Olufunwa: St Johnstone fans are passionate about Dundee game and we will be bang up for it Saints want to start 2024 with a statement victory at Dens.\nBy Eric Nicolson December 28 2023, 10.24pm Share Dare Olufunwa: St Johnstone fans are passionate about Dundee game and we will be bang up for it Share via Facebook Twitter Linkedin Whatsapp Messenger Email Post link https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/sport/football/st-johnstone/4851956/st-johnstone-dundee-dare-olufunwa-fans/ Copy Link 3 comment Dare Olufunwa. Image: SNS.\n‘Safe’ football cost St Johnstone the chance to take all three points from Livingston in midweek, according to Craig Levein.\nBut Dare Olufunwa has pledged the Perth side will go full throttle to try and deliver a perfect New Year gift for Saints fans at Dens Park.\nThe former Southampton and Liverpool defender knows the importance of the clash with local rivals, Dundee to the McDiarmid Park club’s supporters.\nAnd the players could choose no better venue at which to end their winless Premiership run.\n“We want to go into the break on a high,” said Olufunwa.\n“Dundee away is one of the biggest games of the season for us – it definitely is for the fans.\n“I’ve spoken to a few of them who have told me!\n“They’re very passionate about this game. All the boys will be bang up for it.\n“When we played them at home the crowd stuck with us even when we were 2-0 down.\n“Then Max (Kucheriavyi) came up with two late goals.\n96th minute of the match ⚠️\nHis 2nd goal of the game ⚽️⚽️\nMax Kucheriavyi 🇺🇦 #SJFC pic.twitter.com/I0nytuOPKy\n— St. Johnstone FC (@StJohnstone) September 4, 2023\n“I’m sure our fans will make it a great atmosphere and we’ll be doing everything to make sure we give them three points.”\nReflecting on the draw with Livingston, Olufunwa added: “The gaffer told us after the game that the positive to take is we got a clean-sheet.\n“We kept the gap above Livingston at seven and it’s a point that pushes us a little further up the table.\n“Since the manager came in we’ve started playing a lot more football.\n“I don’t know what happened against Livingston – maybe we went into our shell a little bit.\n“The ball was in the air a lot and when it’s a game like that it’s hard to get it down and play. It becomes about headers and clearances.”\nProving his worth to a new manager Olufunwa had a long wait for his first start under Levein but, having played two of the last three matches, patience and training ground perseverance have paid off.\n“When the manager first arrived I sat down with him,” the 22-year-old recalled.\n“He’d never seen me play before.\n“There was a friendly game with St Mirren during the first international break, which I missed because I was ill.\n“It’s hard for a manager to put in a player he’s never seen.\n“I’ve worked really hard in training and I got my chance against Rangers. I thought I was alright.\n“That’s another chance I’ve had against Livingston and it’s about me taking every one that I get.\n“Hopefully, that’s what I’ve been doing.\n“Essentially, it’s about me earning his trust.\n“I need to prove to him that he should be picking me.\n“I need to show every day in training that I’m a good player and, especially when it comes to games, I’ve got to put everything out there.”",
