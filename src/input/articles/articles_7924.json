    "text": "Driver pays for gas, speeds off with pump still attached and returns to scene of massive fuel spill\nIn Japan, an elderly woman causes a major fuel spill and hose break at a gas station due to a moment of distraction.\nEveryone makes mistakes, but some are more dramatic than others. An elderly woman in the Japanese city of Wakkanai, located in Hokkaidō Prefecture, had just finished refueling her car when she drove off with the nozzle still inserted. As a result, she caused a spill of a little more than 13 gallons of gasoline. The incident occurred around 3 p.m. at a self-service gas station near the town.\nAn employee quickly noticed what had happened and called the fire department, which promptly arrived and began cleaning up the mess. Fortunately, the spilled fuel wasn’t wasted. The station was equipped with an underground tank connected to its drainage system, allowing the fuel to be recovered, treated, and reused.\nAs a result, the only reported damages were the broken hose and its nozzle. Just minutes after the incident, the woman returned to the station to apologize and offered to help cover the cost of the damage, according to local Japanese media.\nAn accident that could have been an environmental disaster\nThis accidental episode raises an important question: how can gas stations prevent such accidents from causing serious environmental damage? The answer, as demonstrated here, lies underground — in the drainage and underground fuel storage systems.\nThese systems are specifically designed to capture and contain fuels and hazardous liquids like gasoline, preventing them from seeping into the ground or reaching water sources. In Wakkanai’s case, the roughly 13 gallons of spilled gasoline were channeled through the station’s drainage system into a containment tank, avoiding any environmental contamination.\nThese underground tanks — known as USTs (Underground Storage Tanks) — are typically made from corrosion-resistant materials such as fiberglass or coated steel, and many feature double-walled safety systems. They also include sensors and automated leak detection systems capable of sending alerts at the first sign of a problem.\nIn addition to the tanks, modern gas stations are equipped with channels, grates, and hydrocarbon separators that direct spilled liquids into the proper containment systems, keeping them out of the storm drains and public sewer lines. In countries like Japan, these systems are subject to strict industrial and environmental regulations and undergo regular inspections to ensure their functionality.\nThe importance of such systems cannot be overstated: just one quarter gallon of gasoline can contaminate up to 265,000 gallons of water. That makes these containment mechanisms a vital line of environmental defense at every gas station. So while the Wakkanai incident had the potential to become a serious hazard, the station’s design and preparedness ensured that everything was brought under control within minutes — preventing harm to the environment or the local community.\nGet your game on!

    "text": "Невидимый враг: Назван вирус, который есть у 95% людей и может вызвать рак\nВрач Михалёва: Герпес 4 типа наблюдается у 95% людей и может вызвать рак\nОбложка © Shutterstock / FOTODOM / Corona Borealis Studio\nПочти у каждого взрослого человека (около 95%) обнаруживается вирус Эпштейна-Барр, также известный как герпес-вирус 4 типа. Обычно инфекция протекает незаметно или в слабо выраженной форме. По словам Людмилы Михалёвой, директора НИИ морфологии человека, данный вирус ассоциирован с развитием некоторых видов рака.\n«Вирус связан с неходжкинской лимфомой, включая лимфому Беркитта, первичной церебральной лимфомой, лимфомой Ходжкина (лимфогранулематозом), носоглоточной карциномой, карциномой желудка; с аутоиммунными заболеваниями, например, системной красной волчанкой. Есть сведения о роли инфекции в развитии антифосфолипидного синдрома как причины невынашивания беременности. Лечение этих заболеваний проводится согласно разработанным протоколам», — подчеркнула специалист в беседе с «Газетой.ru».\nДругой вирус, способный спровоцировать онкологические заболевания – Т-лимфотропный вирус человека. Этот ретровирус вызывает у человека пожизненную хроническую инфекцию, которая ослабляет иммунную систему, что приводит к более частому возникновению и тяжёлому течению инфекционных заболеваний. Помимо этого, он может вызвать прогрессирующее поражение нервной системы и связан с развитием Т-клеточной лимфомы взрослых, пояснила эксперт.\nВрач отметила, что эффективных методов лечения Т-лимфотропного вируса не существует, поэтому основное внимание уделяется предотвращению его распространения. Лечение направлено на облегчение сопутствующих заболеваний. Пациентам назначают кортикостероиды, иммуномодуляторы, а также проводят химиотерапию. Вероятность развития Т-клеточной лимфомы взрослых у зараженных оценивается примерно в 5% в течение жизни.\nА ранее россиянам рассказали, какая часто встречающаяся привычка провоцирует рак поджелудочной железы. Эта привычка вызывает воспалительный процесс, негативно влияющий на функционирование органа, который важен для переваривания пищи и контроля уровня сахара в крови.",

After a snowstorm blew through metro Detroit Friday morning, drivers were forced to deal with slick roads, heavy snow and low visibility. Drivers beware: This first official weekend of spring could start with some heavy snow across parts of Ontario It's officially spring, but Friday's snow across southern Ontario could bring one of the largest one-day snowfall totals of the year An archaeological site in Ethiopia has revealed that a population of humans survived the eruption of Sumatra’s Mount Toba 74,000 years ago. He tries to copy his mom and “eat whatever she is currently eating,” zookeepers say. Locals had been killing the snakes because they thought they were poisonous, researchers said. Snowfall persists across Alberta, with another 10-20cm expected to blanket the region. Stay informed with meteorologist Rhythm Reet for the latest updates on weather conditions. A chilly weekend will spread across much of Canada as an active pattern churns through the end of March A widespread swath of snow is expected across southern Ontario on Friday. Some areas could get 10-15 cm, however, the exact track is uncertain. Farther north, less snow for some, farther south more snowfall for some. The Weather Network meteorologist Nadine Powell has the details. After a week that brought heavy snow and travel disruptions to southern Alberta, another round of wintry weather will fill this first full weekend of spring With Canada coming out of its warmest winter on record, some may be enjoying the signs of spring that are showing up much earlier this year: But this isn't good news for the natural world. A drone and robot are aiding in the inspection of the devastation inside the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant reactor, 13 years post-meltdown.

All in all, much fun was had.” Credit: Oakland Zoo via Storyful It won't feel like spring at all in eastern Quebec and on parts of the East Coast as a messy system will be bringing a hefty dose of snowfall for many areas, and heavy rain for others, alongside intense wind gusts Researches discovered the “smooth” animal in a forest of Vietnam. Brace for a wild weather weekend as an impactful system barrels towards the Maritimes, threatening to disrupt travel with freezing rain, heavy snowfall, and the risk of localized flooding More snow is on the way for southern Ontario on Wednesday, a not-so pleasant way to welcome spring into the region for its first full day. A research animal identified as Bear 122 or \"The Boss\" is believed to have been the first grizzly bear spotted out of hibernation. OTTAWA — Canada's carbon price could slash greenhouse-gas emissions by more than 100 million tonnes a year by 2030, but only about one-fifth of that will come from the consumer carbon price at the centre of Conservative attacks. A new analysis published Thursday by the Canadian Climate Institute said the price applied to big industrial emitters plays a far greater role in cutting emissions than the consumer fuel levy. But the consumer levy is still worth the political battle the Liberals are fac Zoo-based research can teach us about the needs of animals in our care.
