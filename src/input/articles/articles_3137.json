(KGNS) - Bethany House of Laredo is stepping up to ensure that individuals living on the streets have a place to escape the harsh elements. Representatives with the shelter say they are prepared for any potential overflow, particularly for emergency shelter services, catering to both adult men and women. Bethany Houses Outreach Specialist Esmeralda Rendon said they are getting the van ready to go up and down Laredo’s streets, distributing essential items such as coats, jackets, scarves, and encouraging individuals to seek refuge at Bethany House. “The majority of our population has substance abuse problems and mental problems so those are really hard cases,” said Rendon. “If they don’t’ want to come, I go to them and make sure they have blankets, food, and hygiene events to cover these weathers.” If you want to lend a hand, Bethany House is open for donations. They are located at 817 Hidalgo St, Laredo, TX 78040. If you would like to get in touch with them, call (956) 722-4152. For more headlines. click [here](https://www.kgns.tv/news/local).

While the first season mostly concentrated on [Kari Baxter](https://meaww.com/the-baxters-episode-3-takeaway-is-kari-baxter-pregnant-kari-baxters-revelation-rocks-tim-baxter)'s ( [Ali Cobrin](https://meaww.com/the-baxters-finale-episode-takeaway-how-did-tim-jacob-die-kari-baxter-in-shambles-over-husbands-death)) tumultuous marriage, the second season gives greater attention to [Ashley Baxter](https://meaww.com/the-baxters-season-3-episode-10-why-the-baxter-family-is-upset-with-ashley-baxter-her-decision-to-help-luke-baxter-leads-to-chaos) ( [Masey McLain](https://meaww.com/prime-videos-family-drama-show-the-baxters-wins-hearts-fans-demand-more-in-season-4)) and Luke Baxter ( [Josh Plasse](https://meaww.com/the-baxters-finale-episode-takeaway-how-did-tim-jacob-die-kari-baxter-in-shambles-over-husbands-death)), two additional Baxter children. In the second season's last episode, Ashley divulges a shocking story about her past, something she still feels guilty about. On the other hand, Kari and [Ryan Taylor](https://meaww.com/the-baxters-season-2-episode-9-takeaway-does-ryan-taylor-reveal-the-truth-about-ashley-to-kari-baxter) ( [Jake Allyn](https://meaww.com/the-baxters-season-3-episode-6-who-is-diane-jacobs-kari-baxter-faces-a-hurdle-before-her-wedding-with-ryan-taylor)) elevate their relationship with an unanticipated lifetime commitment. Furthermore, Luke has moved on and is prepared to begin a relationship with Lori Callahan (Alexa Sutherland), but he still misses Reagan Decker (Cassidy Gifford). Ashley Baxter shares her dark past in the finale of 'The Baxters' Season 2 Ashley, who is a mother to a kid named Cole, eventually opens up to Landon Blake (Orel De La Mota) about her troubled past. She admits that she had a relationship with a married guy, which resulted in her pregnancy. She confides in Landon that she feels bad about wanting a relationship with a married man. While discussing her past, Ashely breaks down. Landon reassures her that she is not guilty because her experience has given her the greatest blessing in life—her son Cole. Ashley thanks him for his encouragement and they share a kiss. Ryan Tylor and Kari Baxter take their relationship to the next level in 'The Baxters' Season 2 After enduring many hardships since season one, Ryan and Kari's relationship is finally beginning to look up. As the couple is seen strolling together, Ryan tells Kari that he loves her unconditionally and that he doesn't want to spend another day apart from her. In a real romantic gesture, the man gets down on his knees and proposes to his lady love with a ring, which she enthusiastically accepts. Elizabeth Baxter misses Luke Baxter in the finale of 'The Baxters' Season 2 Later in the evening, at the memorial garden's opening ceremony, everyone congratulates Kari and Ryan on their new beginnings. The Baxters appeared to be reunited with Erin Baxter (Reilly Anspaugh) and Brooke Baxter-West (Emily Peterson), who were also present with their husbands. [Elizabeth Baxter](https://meaww.com/the-baxters-finale-episode-takeaway-how-did-tim-jacob-die-kari-baxter-in-shambles-over-husbands-death) ( [Roma Downey](https://meaww.com/the-baxters-starring-roma-downey-and-ted-mc-ginley-gets-prime-video-release-date)) says she misses Luke when she sees her entire family together, but John Baxter ( [Ted McGinley](https://meaww.com/lifetime-keeping-up-with-the-joneses-the-wrong-murder-full-cast-list)) reassures her that he will eventually find his way back home. Later, Luke is seen with Lori, who asks that he put Reagan behind him and begin a relationship with her. After some hesitation, Luke chooses to give up his inhibitions. In a surprising turn of events that occurred in the final minutes of the episode, it is revealed that Reagan is pregnant with Luke's kid and that he is oblivious to the fact.

    "text": "By CNN Newsource Published December 5, 2024 3:13 pm By Brady Halbleib\nClick here for updates on this story\n PALERMO, California ( KOVR ) — It was an emotional day for parents and students in the Butte County community after a gunman opened fire at a school, critically injuring two kindergarten boys.\nCBS13 got permission from the parents of one brave sixth-grade girl at Feather River Adventist School who stepped up to help her teacher calm the younger students, all while the shooter was outside the building.\n“I was thinking to myself, what if I get shot, what will happen to my family, what will happen to me,” sixth-grade student Jocelyn Orlando said.\nThat was the terrifying reality for Orlando after gunshots rang out Wednesday afternoon at Feather River Adventist School, sending students and teachers racing to their classrooms to lock their doors.\n“I told the kindergarteners to take deep breaths and think of something happy,” Orlando said. “We were going in from lunch recess and basically everyone in my classroom heard shooting and most people were screaming.”\nIn the face of fear, Orlando and a few of her classmates comforted the little ones, trying to keep them calm all while the shooter was just a few feet away.\n“I told the little graders to close their eyes and cover their ears because he was pacing back and forth from the window,” Orlando said. “We all don’t know what’s going to happen next.”\nThe shooter then turned the gun on himself but not before shooting 5-year-old and 6-year-old boys.\n“I don’t really know. It was really really sad,” Orlando said.\nHours later, families were told to gather at the Oroville Church of Nazarene to be reunited with their children.\n“I tried to get her as quickly as I could as safely as I could while panicking on the inside,” Orlando’s father, Dale, said.\nThe parking lot was crowded with parents consoling each other as law enforcement shared updates and answered questions.\nParents like Dale were relieved to be reunited with their daughter but heartbroken after learning of the two children who had been shot.\n“We’re not the only city, school, family that this has happened to. And this is not how life should be,” Dale said.\nOn Thursday, the One In Five Foundation For Kids, formerly The Uvalde Foundation For Kids, announced that they would be awarding Orlando with an award for heroism for her acts during the incident.\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.
