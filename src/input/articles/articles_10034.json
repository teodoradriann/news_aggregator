    "text": "I have what I think might be an alarming and confusing message for you all. It is not fall yet.\nIt is not fall.\nSo just take your hand off the pumpkin spice latte and BACK AWAY.\nThat's right. Keep going. Back to your lemonade.\nHonestly. Why are we all such dingbats about this? We dream of summer, long for summer, write poems about summer but once it's here we wish it away. By August we're idiotically thinking think You Know What? I really like flannel. I want to put on my damn flannel. Why, WHY, WHY summer, are you holding my flannel hostage. Then around the middle of August people snap and start lighting apple pie candles and wrapping themselves in sheepskin rugs while wearing flip flips.\nIf you're still scratching mosquito bites it's too early to light a pumpkin spice candle.\nIt's going to come. Actual fall. On September 22nd in the Northern Hemisphere as a matter of fact. But that's just a date. Fall might come earlier or it might come later.\nI understand pumpkin themed retail displays have muddied the waters a bit and many of us have actually lost our natural, seasonal compass.\nSo in case you're a bit iffy on when it's actually fall here are some tips.\n10 No-Fail Signs It's Fall. Tik Tok is filled with shots of people pretending they're happily picking apples even though they just had a huge fight in the car on the way to the orchard and never even thought of picking apples before the invention of social media. Costco is sold out of all their Christmas wrapping paper. You drop kick the hanging baskets you stopped watering 2 months ago into the garbage. You dip into your pajama drawer for the warm ones and they have that drawer smell. You stop shaving above the knee. And below the knee. Bully through the week of itchiness then happily revel in skin that feels like a plushie for 6 months. You start to forget your neighbours' names again. You spend 4 nights in a row Pinning wintery craft things like whimsical cross stitch patterns you'll never actually do because - binge watching season. Your hair is staticky and you broke a nail making the bed. You realize yet again, you look dorky, not adorable in hats. Black nail polish. O.K. so now that you feel more comfortable in recognizing the season of fall on your own, you can enjoy this last long weekend of the summer.\nEnjoy it, do something summery, eat a hamburger, skateboard on a boardwalk, get sprayed by a skunk.\nJust back away from the pumpkin spiced latte.\nHave a good last long weekend of the summer.",

    "text": "North Carolina Attorney General launches initiative protect Helene survivors from contractor fraud\nSafe to Rebuild initiative serves as a warning to would-be criminals\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - Law enforcement from across the High Country is teaming up with the state bureau of investigation and North Carolina Attorney General to protect people in the wake of Hurricane Helene.\nSix months after the storm, they are now preparing for an uptick in bad actors posing as people trying to help survivors.\n“We anticipate that may increase.. due to the building season coming on,” Avery County Sheriff Mike Henley said. “So you know, our objective is just to get ahead of this.”\nNorth Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson said western North Carolina is entering a new phase in the aftermath of Helene.\n“In the immediate aftermath of Helene, it was the recovery phase,” Jackson said. “We were worried mainly about price gouging. Now we’re out of that and more into the rebuilding phase. A lot of the rebuilding is going to be done by unlicensed contractors. Demand for their services is going to be very high. We’re glad that contractors are coming to Western, North Carolina, but we need them to know that if they treat people dishonestly, if they take advantage of people, they will be held accountable.”\nIn addition to warning potential criminals, the Attorney General’s office recommends consumers do the following:\n- Get written estimates and comparing bids.\n- Get a written contract.\n- Protect your payment. Never pay for most or all of the work before it’s completed and do not pay in cash.\n“If folks do literally no work, that’s actually a crime in North Carolina,” Jackson said. “Those contractors can face criminal consequences. A lot of them do partial work, and then it’s a question of, well, did you do the work that you said you were going to do?”\nJackson says a top priority for himself as attorney general is to educate the public about the power of filing reports to his office.\n“It doesn’t have to be a lot of complaints,” he said. “If there’s one highly detailed complaint, we will use that as the basis for an investigation.”\nHe says if a business does not respond to his office, they can escalate it.\nClick here for more information on the Safe to Rebuild Initiative and how to file a complaint with the North Carolina Attorney General’s Office.\nCopyright 2025 WBTV.

    "text": "Hamas has accepted a cease-fire deal proposed by Egypt and Qatar TEL AVIV, Israel — Hamas has accepted a proposal from Egypt and Qatar for a cease-fire in its seven-month war with Israel, the Palestinian group said in a statement Monday. The announcement came hours after [Israel ordered](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/06/1249298738/israel-palestinians-evacuate-rafah) tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians to evacuate parts of southern Gaza, signaling a ground assault might be imminent. It is not immediately clear what the proposal entails, nor what Israel's position is. An Israeli official [told local TV](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel-at-war/artc-hamas-announces-it-has-agreed-to-proposed-ceasefire-and-hostage-deal-with-israel) that the Israeli government was \"checking which formula Hamas has agreed to.\" In a statement late Monday, Hamas said its top leader, Ismail Haniyeh, had informed Qatar's prime minister and Egypt's intelligence minister \"of the Hamas movement's approval of their proposal regarding the cease-fire agreement.\" The announcement on Monday — on the eve of the Gaza war's seven-month mark — raised hopes for some that the fighting may come to a pause.

    "text": "Umer Jamshaid Published August 23, 2024 | 09:40 AM\nSeoul, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 23rd Aug, 2024) North Korea on Friday criticised recent US arms sales in Asia , calling a deal to deliver Apache helicopters to South Korea a \"reckless, provocative act\" and adding it would build up its own forces in response.\n\"We strongly oppose and reject the US and its vassal forces' arms buildup,\" Pyongyang 's Foreign Ministry said in a statement, referring to the South.\n\"This is a reckless, provocative act of deliberately increasing the security instability in the region,\" it added, also criticising recent US sales to Japan and other Asia-Pacific allies of Washington .\nOn Monday, the United States announced its approval of a $3.5 billion sale to South Korea of up to 36 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters and related equipment, including missiles.\nThe US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said the sale would \"improve the Republic of Korea's capability to meet current and future threats by providing a credible force capable of deterring adversaries and participating in regional operations\", using South Korea 's formal name.\nWhile the State Department approved the sale , the US Congress must still sign off on the transaction.\nSeoul 's unification ministry said Friday that North Korea was the one \"threatening peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula\".\nPyongyang has defined inter-Korean relations as those of \"two hostile nations\" and is continuously \"developing and advancing illegal nuclear and missiles\", it added.\nThe South Korean government is \"closely monitoring and thoroughly assessing North Korea 's activities through close cooperation with relevant agencies,\" Kim In-ae, vice spokesperson for the ministry, told reporters.\nWashington is Seoul 's key security ally and stations about 28,500 troops in South Korea , with their role including helping to protect it from its nuclear-armed neighbour.\nPyongyang also said Friday that US arms sales in the Pacific would prompt the North's \"strategic deterrence\" to be \"further strengthened\" in response.\n\"The prevailing situation urgently calls for thoroughly ensuring the military balance in the region by increasing the defence capabilities in every way in direct proportion to security challenges and threats that may result from the US arms sales,\" it said.\nnews of the helicopter sale came the same day that Washington and Seoul began major annual joint military drills, with new exercises aimed at containing the North.\nThe Ulchi Freedom Shield exercise runs until August 29 and will involve thousands of military personnel.\nNorth Korea -- which attacked its neighbour in 1950, triggering the Korean War -- has always been infuriated by joint US-South Korean military exercises, decrying them as rehearsals for invasion.\nRelations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North sending trash-carrying balloons across its southern border .",
