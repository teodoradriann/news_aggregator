    "title": "Pulse Oximeters Infrequently Tested by Manufacturers on Diverse Sets of Subjects",
    "text": "Manufacturers increasingly but still infrequently follow Food and Drug Administration guidance that recommends testing pulse oximeters on participants with a range of skin pigmentations, according to a new study led by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\nThe FDA made the recommendation in 2013, following reports that pulse oximeters—devices that measure blood-oxygen levels by shining light through the skin—can be less accurate when used on people with dark skin and that undetected low oxygen levels are more common in non-white patients. This puts patients with darker skin at risk for missed symptoms and potential misdiagnoses.\nIn the new study, the researchers analyzed publicly available FDA clearance summaries from manufacturers of FDA-regulated pulse oximeters before and after the FDA’s guidance. They found only a quarter of the summaries since 2016 include language suggesting compliance, up from just 4.1% before the guidance was issued.\nThe FDA ‘clears’ medical devices that are sufficiently similar to devices that have already been approved by the FDA. Pulse oximeters intended for use in medical decision making or monitoring, whether at home or in a clinical setting, go through this FDA pathway. They became even more widely used during the COVID pandemic, as many people bought them for home use.\nThe findings are described in a peer-reviewed research letter published online December 30 in JAMA. On January 6, the FDA announced updated draft guidance for manufacturers on pulse oximeters. The FDA’s new draft guidance includes recommendations for manufacturers to include larger numbers of participants with a range of skin tones in their testing.\n“Our findings underscore the limits of voluntary guidance alone for solving bias in pulse oximeters,” says study lead author Kadija Ferryman, PhD, an assistant professor in the Bloomberg School’s Department of Health Policy and Management and the Berman Institute of Bioethics. “The FDA’s new draft guidance is a step in the right direction, but others, including manufacturers, health care organizations, and other organizations committed to patient safety can contribute to addressing this bias.” In a companion Viewpoint published December 30 in JAMA, Ferryman and colleagues describe bias in pulse oximetry as a “wicked problem” with no easy solutions.\nPulse oximeters gauge the proportion of oxygen-carrying red blood cells in a patient’s bloodstream by shining light of two wavelengths through the patient’s finger and comparing the differential absorbance of those wavelengths. Now standard tools in clinical settings, pulse oximeters are especially useful in monitoring and assessing the care needs of patients who may have dangerously low levels of blood oxygenation (hypoxemia) due to heart or lung conditions, including COVID-19.\nClinicians since the 1990s have been reporting that pulse oximeters often give false readings in people with dark skin. Such reports eventually led the FDA to issue a guidance in 2013 for oximeter manufacturers that they include in their studies “subjects with a range of skin pigmentations, including at least two darkly pigmented subjects or 15% of your subject pool, whichever is larger.”\nIn their new analysis, Ferryman and colleagues examined manufacturers’ adherence to this recommendation. The researchers searched an FDA database containing the agency’s product clearance summaries for pulse oximeters, identifying and retrieving a total of 767 oximeter clearance summaries for the period 1996-2024. They then compared the frequency of summaries containing any of 17 search terms relating to race, ethnicity or skin color in the pre-guidance period 1996–2012, the period 2013–2015 around the time of the guidance, and the post-guidance period from 2016 to 2024.\nThey found that 17 of the 412 documents from the pre-guidance period (4.1%), 12 of 87 (13.8%) from around the guidance period, and 67 of the 268 documents (25.0%) from the post-guidance period contained one or more of their search terms. This suggested that the FDA’s guidance did have an impact, but only a small one—the vast majority of post-guidance summaries made no reference to the skin tone issue or to tests with diverse subjects.\nExamining the search term-containing summaries, the researchers also observed that they broadly lacked a standardized framework for assessing skin tone variation, often describing test subjects’ skin simply as “dark” or “light,” or making reference only to their ethnic or racial background.\nThe draft guidance issued on January 6 is open for comments until March 10.\n“Adherence to FDA Guidance on Pulse Oximetry Testing Among Diverse Individuals, 1996–2024” was written by Kadija Ferryman, Deidra Crews, Emmanuel Drabo, Theodore Iwashyna, Odia Kane, and John Jackson.\n“Addressing Racial and Ethnic Bias in Pulse Oximeters—A Wicked Problem” was written by Carmel Shachar, Emmanuel Drabo, Theodore Iwashyna, and Kadija Ferryman.\nThe study was funded by a Nexus Research Award from Johns Hopkins University.\n# # #\nMEDIA CONTACT\n[Register for reporter access to contact details](/users/register)",

    "text": "‘She saved my son’s life’: Taco Bell manager saves baby who stopped breathing in drive-thru RICHBORO, Pa. (WPVI) - A family in Pennsylvania says they have a quick-thinking Taco Bell manager to thank for saving their child’s life. Natasha Long says the situation started when her 11-week-old baby suddenly stopped breathing while she was in the drive-thru at the fast-food restaurant. “It was the scariest moment of my entire life,” Long said. The mother of two had just finished some errands and decided to grab food when she says she noticed baby Myles struggling for air in the back seat of the car. “I pulled him out and he turned completely blue and was lifeless. At that point I just completely blacked out. I didn’t know what to do,” she said. Fortunately, Long was in earshot of Taco Bell manager Becky Arbaugh, who heard the mother’s screams and quickly jumped in to give baby Myles CPR. “I ran outside and took the baby,” Arbaugh said. “I then started to do chest compressions on the baby, and he finally started to breathe.” Long said the manager appeared out of nowhere like a guardian angel. According to Arbaugh, her own scares as a mother helped her prepare for a moment like this. “When my kids were little, my daughter had similar incidents. So, I knew what she was feeling, and there was no thought in my mind that the baby wasn’t going to breathe again,” Arbaugh said. Baby Myles did regain his breath and was rushed to Saint Christopher’s Hospital for treatment. The next day Long said she called Taco Bell to thank Arbaugh, who she calls her hero. “We couldn’t be more grateful to Becky. She saved my son’s life,” Long said. Baby Myles remains in the hospital as doctors try to understand what happened to him. Meanwhile, Long has been sending videos and pictures to Arbaugh -- who now has a deep bond with the family.

    "title": "Study finds cell-based therapy to fight cancer",
    "text": "Pennsylvania, December 28 W istar researchers successfully evaluated a simple intervention that could unlock higher anti-tumour potential in T-cell therapies, a strategy known as \"cell-based therapy,\" which uses specifically tailored T cells to combat cancer. istar researchers successfully evaluated a simple intervention that could unlock higher anti-tumour potential in T-cell therapies, a strategy known as \"cell-based therapy,\" which uses specifically tailored T cells to combat cancer. Dr. Hildegund C.J. Ertl, a professor in The Wistar Institute's Vaccine & Immunotherapy Centre, led the team that demonstrated an exciting concept: that the common cholesterol drug fenofibrate can boost T cells' ability to destroy human tumours, as described in their new paper, \"Treatment with the PPAR agonist fenofibrate improves the efficacy of CD8+ T cell therapy for melanoma,\" CD8+ T cells work very well in fighting liquid tumors, but for solid tumors like melanoma, the cell-based therapy approach can stall due to the physical structure of the cancer. The T cells infiltrate the tumor, but the cancer adapts and saps the T cells' energy by hijacking the form of metabolism that the T cells use: glycolysis, which turns sugar into energy. Without energy, the T cells first lose functions and then die, and the cancer continues to grow. But Dr. Ertl's team has been able to circumvent this problem by forcing T cells to use a different energy source than glucose. They used fenofibrate because, as a cholesterol-lowering compound, the drug is a PPARa agonist. When PPARa is upregulated, cellular metabolism is switched from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation, or FAO. This mechanism works to improve cholesterol levels in human patients, but for Dr. Ertl's purposes, the fenofibrate-induced switch to FAO provided T cells with a form of energy that cancer couldn't exploit -- which is how Dr. Ertl proved that fenofibrate has been able to boost the killing power of T cells deployed against cancerous cell lines. In this paper, the authors wanted to see whether this kind of cancer-killing improvement would have similar effects when deployed against not just cancer cell lines but solid human tumor fragments -- a more challenging proposition. The group treated T cells with fenofibrate, and the hypothesis held: Dr. Ertl's team watched the T cells treated with fenofibrate survive longer and kill more cancer in preclinical models with human solid tumor masses than the T cells that didn't receive the treatment. \"Treating T cells with fenofibrate before using them as a cancer treatment flips a switch of sorts in their metabolism,\" said Dr. Hildegund Ertl. \"Once that switch is flipped, T cells can destroy the cancer much more effectively. And we've confirmed that this holds for larger human tumor masses.\" As a result of these findings, Dr. Ertl and her team think this intervention shows great promise for future anti-tumor therapies. \"Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer. Anything we can do to chip away at the cancer and destroy more of it -- even a simple pre-treatment step like this one -- can make a world of difference.\" Study finds cell-based therapy to fight cancer Found this article helpful?
