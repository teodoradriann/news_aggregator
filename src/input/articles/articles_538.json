    "text": "CHICAGO – It’s last minute gift time, and Paramount Pictures has the Anniversary and Special Edition DVD collections that make great stocking stuffers for the cinema buff in your life. The videos below will highlight the titles, either celebrating major anniversaries with deluxe 4K Ultra HD releases, or packages of special release editions.\nFilm Review: Lackluster ‘Dog Man’ Barks Up an Unfunny Tree\nPatrickMcDon January 30, 2025 - 9:15am\nCHICAGO – A Big ‘ARF’ of rejection for this animated mutt that fails to fetch many laughs. Source book author Dav Pilkey (“Captain Underpants”) came up with Dog Man while in the second grade, and that’s about the upper age limit of those who may still find these sort of dim-witted antics entertaining.\nAfter a gruesome accident, a cop and his trusty dog are injured and surgeons sew the dog’s head onto the cop’s body. So Dog Man (vocal effects by Peter Hastings) is a crime fighter who loses focus whenever a ball is around and other assorted dog related behaviors. He lives in a dog house and that’s about it. His arch nemesis is Petey the Cat (Pete Davidson) … a megalomaniacal cat out to take over the world with various harebrained contraptions, but is constantly thwarted by Dog Man. The movie is largely based on the first few Dog Man books, but exhausts its source material in about the first 20 minutes. So it’s left to narratively chase its own tale for another hour or so to meet the bare minimum of cinematic running time.\nContinue reading for Spike Walter’s full review of “Dog Man”\nDog Man\nPhoto credit: Universal Pictures\nContinue reading for Spike Walter’s full review of “Dog Man”",

    "text": "Bengals wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase trash talks Chiefs, happily provides bulletin board material [Kelsey Conway](https://www.cincinnati.com/staff/8218110002/kelsey-conway/) Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase is one of the biggest trash talkers in the NFL and it’s not an act when he does it. He knows exactly what he’s doing. Chase is a brutally honest individual and he’s always going to tell it how it is no matter the circumstance. On Thursday when asked about the upcoming matchup against the Chiefs and what stands out about Kansas City’s secondary, Chase answered exactly how you would expect – with honesty. Bengals Chiefs injuries [Ja’Marr Chase says he will be a game-time decision on if he’ll play in Bengals vs. Chiefs](/story/sports/nfl/bengals/2023/12/28/jamarr-chase-provides-an-udpate-on-his-status-for-bengals-at-chiefs/72051847007/) Bengals Chiefs [Bass: Why Bengals have Chiefs right where they want them](/story/sports/nfl/bengals/2023/12/28/bass-on-this-rollercoaster-ride-cincinnati-bengals-can-just-take-the-kansas-city-chiefs-in-stride/72048083007/) Bengals Chiefs defense [What Bengals cornerback Chidobe Awuzie has learned about the chip on his shoulder](/story/sports/nfl/bengals/2023/12/28/what-bengals-cornerback-chidobe-awuzie-is-working-to-prove/72049150007/) “If I'm being honest, nothing,” Chase said. “They just know how to play us. They know the leverages. They know what (receiver) splits we're in. They just know what we going to do at certain moments. They throw a little double-double at us to stop the two best players on our side and that's all they do. I mean, it's not really like they got a Jalen Ramsey on their squad. So, not much.\" He doubled down with his comments by acknowledging he knows he’s providing bulletin board material for the Chiefs ahead of the game. “I’m just adding fire to the fuel right now, they’re going to take this and run with it,” Chase said. “I hope they put it in their locker (room) but it’s alright though, as long as I’m mentally ready to play.” It isn’t uncommon for Chase to respond this way. He’s not one to get into the fine details of his opponents’ defensive scheme or be overly complementary. Bengals Chiefs [Bengals safety Dax Hill: 'I have so much more to contribute'](/story/sports/nfl/bengals/2023/12/27/bengals-safety-dax-hill-i-have-so-much-more-to-contribute/72040681007/) Bengals Chiefs Jake Browning [The next step for Jake Browning is cutting down on interceptions](/story/sports/nfl/bengals/2023/12/24/the-next-step-for-bengals-quarterback-jake-browning/72025350007/) Bengals Pro Football Hall of Fame [Pro Football Hall of Fame names Cincinnati Bengals legend Willie Anderson a 2024 finalist](/story/sports/nfl/2023/12/28/2024-pro-football-hall-of-fame-finalists-meet-the-15-candidates/72046481007/) He did explain that he woke up feeling “pissed off” and Kansas City historically talks the most trash to him and perhaps that’s where his comments stem from. “They can take it how they wanna, I don’t care,” Chase said. “I know what I see on paper and in game. That’s why they double everybody cause they can’t do it 1-on-1. The best player on their team is (L’Jarius) Sneed, that’s a fact. Everybody knows that. That’s why they double everything they see. They drafted two new cornerbacks that are longer, they trying to match (L’Jarius) Sneed. That’s why Sneed is at cornerback now. I already know it; I’m not bugged about it. They know I’m good, they know how to play us. It’s not like they have a superstar on their defense.” If there is a player who can talk trash to the Chiefs, it’s Chase. In four games against the Chiefs since 2021, including the playoffs, Chase has caught 30 passes for 429 yards and four touchdowns. Sunday's game has massive implications for the Bengals. If they win, they are one game away from likely clinching a playoff berth for a third consecutive season. If they lose, they will pretty much be able to say goodbye to their postseason hopes. All signs point to Chase being able to play but he did mention he will give himself as many days as possible before declaring if he will play. Chase injured his shoulder against the Vikings and missed Cincinnati's most recent loss to the Steelers but returned to practice on Thursday.",
