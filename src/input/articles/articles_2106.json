    "text": "[Entertainment](../)\nZelda: Echoes Of Wisdom’s Cutest Echo Shouldn’t Have Been Its Most Useless\nWhat is arguably the cutest Echo that can be found in [The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom](//screenrant.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/) is unfortunately also the game’s most useless. Leveraging the numerous uses of Echoes is the foundation of EoW’s gameplay, with many individual Echoes functioning in a wide variety of situations. However, there is one Echo that is functionally useless for most of the game, despite being very visually appealing.\nWith so many different Echoes available, it is all but inevitable that some will be of more use than others. After all, while many are interchangeable to some extent, some of [Echoes of Wisdom’s items can be unexpectedly powerful](//screenrant.com/zelda-echoes-wisdom-bed-overpowered-item/). Naturally, a large part of this depends on how versatile any given Echo is, and what [useful tricks in Echoes of Wisdom](//screenrant.com/zelda-echoes-wisom-most-useful-echoes/) can be accomplished with them. On the other hand, not every Echo has the same range of use, and some can essentially become obsolete as the game progresses.\nZelda: Echoes Of Wisdom’s Teddy Bear Echo Is Irrelevant\nThe Stuffed Toy Unfortunately Lacks Proper Gameplay Utility\nThe Stuffed Toy Echo, which takes the form of a teddy bear, can be found in a hidden cave beneath a grave in Hyrule’s graveyard. Moreover, it is arguably useless outside of that location. This is because the Stuffed Toy’s sole function is to draw the attention of Ghini, four of which can be found fascinated by the original toy in the same underground cave. However, such a niche specialization means that this teddy bear has little use outside of encounters with the graveyard’s ghosts. And even then, Ghini are relatively easy to defeat whether or not they are distracted.\nSpeaking to a woman in the graveyard reveals that the original Stuffed Toy was once stolen from her grandfather by a Ghini, demonstrating the item’s appeal to the ghosts. However, beyond the graveyard, the Stuffed Toy is easily forgotten, especially with so many other (and likely more prominent) Echoes that can be used as cheap platforms. Of course, those aiming to [collect every Echo in the game](//screenrant.com/zelda-echoes-wisdom-every-echo-reward/) will still want to find the Stuffed Toy, but the resulting sense of completion is arguably the only lasting benefit from doing so.\nA Cute Idea Deserved To Be Fleshed Out\nThe Stuffed Toy Should Have Been Part Of A Side Quest\nWhile its appearance is incredibly cute, the unique Ghost-attracting property of the Stuffed Toy is ultimately underused, and would have been perfect as the center of a sadly [non-existent side quest in Echoes of Wisdom](//screenrant.com/zelda-echoes-wisdom-npcs-lovers-well-quest/). For example, Zelda could have been tasked with presenting this Echo to the granddaughter of the original toy’s owner, or even used it to comfort an upset child. Alternatively, the teddy bear may have been necessary to assist somebody being plagued by Ghini, either near or far from the graveyard where it is found.\n[Related ](//screenrant.com/zelda-echoes-wisdom-best-side-quests-do-first/)\n[ 10 Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom Side Quests You’ll Definitely Want To Do ASAP ](//screenrant.com/zelda-echoes-wisdom-best-side-quests-do-first/)\nNot every side quest in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom offers great rewards, but the ones that do definitely shouldn’t be missed for long.\nThe Stuffed Toy is the cutest Echo that Zelda can find in the course of her journey, but the fact that it is found hidden away and forgotten only reflects its lack of use in the wider game. Ghini are far from common in Hyrule, and so the Stuffed Toy may never be used again after leaving their graveyard home. Ultimately, it is disappointing that The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom did not incorporate this Echo further into its gameplay, such as through a side quest, and instead allowed it to quickly fade into obscurity.\n[World News](/)||\n[Latest News](/news)||\n[U.S. News](../../us-news)\n[Source link](//screenrant.com/zelda-echoes-wisdom-teddy-bear-echo-useless/)",

    "text": "The Shadow Returns: How ISIS is Exploiting Instability in Syria and Iraq The fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime, long predicted and recently realized, hasn’t brought stability to Syria – it’s opened a dangerous window for the resurgence of ISIS . While the group’s territorial caliphate is gone, intelligence reports from over 20 sources across the region and internationally reveal a calculated reactivation of sleeper cells, recruitment efforts, and a disturbing willingness to exploit the power vacuum. This isn’t a repeat of 2014, but a more insidious, adaptable threat that demands a reassessment of counter-terrorism strategies.\nA Resurgent Threat: Beyond Declared Attacks The numbers initially appear reassuring. ISIS has claimed responsibility for significantly fewer attacks in the first five months of 2025 – 38 in Syria and 4 in Iraq – compared to 2024. However, this decline shouldn’t be mistaken for weakness. As Rita Katz, director of Site Intelligence Group, points out, it’s far more likely a period of strategic regrouping. The group is focusing on rebuilding its infrastructure, reactivating networks, and identifying vulnerabilities in the newly fractured Syrian landscape.\nRecent foiled attacks, like the attempted bombing in Daquq, Iraq, demonstrate ISIS’s continued operational capacity. The capture of envoys dispatched from Raqqa to Iraq, carrying instructions for attacks, highlights a coordinated effort to reignite violence. These incidents, while prevented, are warning signs of a deliberate strategy to capitalize on the chaos following Assad’s removal.\nThe Syrian Crucible: A Perfect Storm for Extremism Syria, under its new Islamist leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, faces a monumental task of unification after 13 years of civil war. This delicate transition is precisely what ISIS seeks to exploit. The lifting of sanctions by the US, while intended to support al-Sharaa, has also fueled criticism from hardliners who fear concessions to Western demands – particularly regarding the expulsion of foreign fighters and normalization with Israel. ISIS is actively leveraging these divisions, calling on foreign fighters to join its ranks in publications like al-Naba .\nThe situation is further complicated by the US troop drawdown, potentially halving its presence in Syria to around 1,000. This reduction raises concerns about the security of prisons and camps holding approximately 9,000 ISIS fighters and their families, guarded by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Recent attempted jailbreaks underscore the fragility of these facilities. Turkey, under President Erdogan, is pushing for Syria to assume responsibility for these facilities, a move complicated by Damascus’s limited manpower and the complex relationship with Kurdish factions.\nThe Foreign Fighter Factor Intelligence agencies are also tracking a concerning, albeit small, increase in suspected foreign fighters traveling to Syria from Europe. While the numbers are currently low, the potential for radicalized individuals to bolster ISIS ranks cannot be ignored. This influx, coupled with the potential for released prisoners, presents a significant security challenge.\nIraq’s Precarious Position: Weapons and Sleeper Cells Iraq, where ISIS first gained prominence, remains vulnerable. Iraqi officials fear that ISIS seized stockpiles of weapons abandoned by Assad’s forces, potentially smuggling them across the border. Increased activity has been detected in the Hamrin Mountains, a long-time refuge, and along key roads. The reactivation of sleeper cells, combined with the potential influx of arms, poses a serious threat to Iraq’s hard-won stability.\nBeyond Syria and Iraq: A Global Network Adapts While Syria and Iraq are currently the focal points, it’s crucial to remember that ISIS’s influence extends far beyond these borders. The group’s most active branches are now in Africa, with Abdulqadir Mumin, head of the Somalia branch, believed to be the current leader. This geographical shift highlights ISIS’s adaptability and its ability to exploit instability in various regions. Understanding this global network is critical to containing the threat. The Council on Foreign Relations’ Global Conflict Tracker provides a comprehensive overview of ISIS activity worldwide.\nThe Path Forward: Intelligence, Cooperation, and Long-Term Commitment The situation demands a multifaceted approach. Increased intelligence sharing between regional and international partners is paramount. Pre-emptive operations, like those credited by Iraqi officials for keeping ISIS in check, must continue. However, military action alone is insufficient. Addressing the underlying political and economic grievances that fuel extremism is essential. The US, despite its planned troop reductions, must maintain a vigilant presence and continue to support its vetted partners on the ground. Ultimately, preventing an ISIS resurgence requires a long-term commitment to stability and security in the region. The challenge isn’t simply defeating ISIS; it’s preventing the conditions that allow it to thrive.\nWhat strategies do you believe are most critical to countering the evolving ISIS threat?

    "text": "This inaction has led to a rise in water demand, continued contamination of water bodies and groundwater pollution. Image used for representative purpose. Bosky Khanna Updated on: 06 Mar 2025, 2:36 am 2 min read\nCopied\nBENGALURU: Despite Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s push to encourage private apartments to use treated water to ease Bengaluru’s water demand, little progress has been made.\nThough newly-constructed apartments are using treated water, lack of prescribed usage and enforcement has made little impact.\nThe Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) and Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) have been unable to take tough decisions in enforcing the use of treated water in existing apartment complexes and commercial complexes. This inaction has led to a rise in water demand, continued contamination of water bodies and groundwater pollution. KSPCB officials admitted that while efforts are underway, progress is far slower than needed.\nFollowing the budget announcement, KSPCB introduced a single-window system to clear proposals and simplify the procedure to obtain clearance under the Ease of Doing Business initiative. However, officials admit that full implementation will take some more time as synchronising all government agencies under one platform for projects takes time.\nKSPCB is also moving slow in addressing the water quality of water bodies in the state. While real-time water quality measurement stations and environmental laboratories are being set up, experts and citizens point out that it is too late.\nThey also stated that little is being done to clean Vrishabhavathi Valley, which contains most of Bengaluru’s sewage. A KSPCB report on pollution levels in water bodies across the state shows the quality of water as poor and unfit for consumption or irrigation.\nThe forest and environment department faces similar challenges, with human-wildlife conflicts on the rise. The government has been unable to take stern measures to control encroachment and undertake tribal relocation programme.\nIncreasing human intervention -- through road construction, power lines, and pumped storage projects is exacerbating conflicts. Though the government sanctioned funds for rail barricades, procurement has not been addressed. Strengthening elephant corridors has been largely ignored, and buffer zones around forests to limit colonisation remain poorly maintained, allowing further encroachment.\nThe proposed Honnikeri Reserve and Blackbuck Sanctuary in Bidar is yet to materialise. However, the formation of an elephant and leopard task force was a good idea, forest department officials said. The government in this budget should announce methods to strengthen it by permitting the use of technological interventions and smart tools.\nThe officials are looking for more control in conflict-prone areas, rather than depending on local municipalities and police for support. The department is also looking for an increased allocation to the department to ensure timely payment of wages to watchers and take up conservation works in forests, like deweeding and habitat improvement.\n“We do not want money to set up artificial water bodies, instead the money should be allocated for conflict mitigation and habitat improvement. Funds should be allocated so that compensation awarded to aggrieved families and farmers is released immediately and not kept pending for 5-6 months,” said a forest department official.",
