    "title": "Gavin Newsom on Harvey Weinstein's 2020 rape conviction being overturned: \"He's a rapist\" - CBS Sacramento",
    "text": "WINTERS – Gavin Newsom was asked to comment about Harvey Weinstein's 2020 rape conviction being overturned on Thursday , and the California governor didn't mince words.\n\"Harvey Weinstein is a stone-cold predator. He's a rapist, twice convicted. Not once, twice,\" Newsom said on Thursday.\nNew York's highest court overturned the disgraced Hollywood producer's rape conviction on Thursday and ordered a new trial. The New York Court of Appeals said the judge in the Weinstein case made several improper rulings, preventing the now 72-year-old from getting a fair trial.\nJennifer Siebel, Newsom's wife, testified in a different trial in Los Angeles in 2022 that Weinstein raped her in a hotel room in 2005. She was the fourth accuser to testify in that case.\nThursday's developments that saw the New York conviction overturned stemmed from the judge's decision to allow prosecutors to call witnesses whose accusations were not part of the charges against Weinstein, according to the appeals court.\n Arthur Aidala, attorney for Harvey Weinstein speaks during a press conference at Collect Pond Park near Manhattan Criminal Court on April 25, 2024 in New York City. The New York Court of Appeals overturned the 2020 sex crime convictions of Weinstein by a 4-3 vote and ordered a new trial. Michael M. Santiago / Staff / Getty Images In his comments about the case being overturned, Newsom also called out Weinstein's attorneys Alan Jackson and Mark Werksman by name.\n\"They should be ashamed of themselves, just generally,\" Newsom said. \"And those who seek to somehow exonerate or explain away Harvey Weinstein's behavior should also be ashamed of themselves.\"\nWeinstein has been serving a 23-year sentence in New York. While the court says he will get a new trial for the 2020 rape conviction, he'll remain in prison due to the conviction in the 2022 Los Angeles case.\n\"He should never see the light of day. Period, full stop,\" Newsom said.\nNewsom was speaking in Winters on Thursday about California's renewable electricity generation push.\nWeinstein's New York attorney celebrated after the state's Supreme Court ruling.\n\"Today's legal ruling is a great day for America,\" Attorney Arthur Aidan said.\nActress Ashley Judd, one of Weinstein's accusers, called out the court ruling and called for what she described as institutional courage.\n\"This today was an act of institutional betrayal,\" Judd said. \"First and foremost, I want to say that I stand in sisterhood and solidarity with all survivors of sexual violence.\"\nWeinstein's California legal team did not respond to requests for a statement.",

    "title": "Seán Ronayne: Cork ornithologist advocates for bird preservation",
    "text": "The man pursuing the sound of every bird in Ireland\nWith more than half of Ireland's birds at risk of extinction, an Irish ornithologist is utilising recordings he has made to advocate for their preservation.\nOriginally from Cobh in County Cork, Seán Ronayne has approximately 12,000 recordings of Irish birds and other wildlife in his possession.\nA documentary team have followed his mission as he attempts to capture recordings of every species of bird in Ireland.\nHowever, Seán believes \"it's not just birds that are at risk of extinction, these are a symptom of something much greater\".\nHaving been immersed in nature from a young age, Seán Ronayne's project didn't begin until he moved to Spain in 2018.\nWhile living in Barcelona, Seán said he started record birds \"because there were so many new species there\".\n\"I bought a sound recorder to give myself a chance to figure out what I was listening to and then realised that there was value in sharing the sounds with people,\" he told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"People reacted to it and I realised that I enjoyed telling their stories.\"\nSeán then returned to Ireland and decided to record \"every bird sound\".\nWith almost 200 native birds already recorded, he has three species left on his list - the grey partridge, great skua and the red-breasted merganser.\nAll three are increasingly difficult to locate, he explained.\nSeán said the great skua will even attack humans.\n\"A tough bird, they're seabirds, they wait for other birds to catch food, they chase them down, they attack them and then steal the food from them.\"\nEven if the bird has swallowed the food, Seán explained, \"they'll attack them until they regurgitate it\".\n\"They'll even attack you too, if you go near their nesting area.\"\nThe grey partridge, Seán continued, is \"a species that's almost extinct in Ireland\".\n\"[It's] a ground-nesting species that suffered very much at the hands of the mechanisation of our agricultural practices, remaining in one site in the midlands, in County Offaly.\n\"Even at that, they're a species that had to be reintroduced, supplemented by birds from Scandinavia.\"\n'Destruction and greed'\nWhen pursuing this amass of birds to add to the portfolio, Seán said in Ireland's landscape he has seen \"destruction and greed\".\nThe region is \"ecologically devastated\", he said.\nHowever, \"it's not too late\", he added.\n\"There are fragments of beauty and hope out there, that we can build out from.\n\"When you go to places outside of Ireland, it really hits home.\"\nSpeaking to BBC News NI from Seattle, Seán said in parts of the US \"it's illegal to cut down a tree\".\n\"You need to have permission, and when you do cut it down you have to replace it with a mature tree,\" he said.\nIrish people \"should be taking example from places like this\", he said.\n\"63% of Irish birds are at risk of extinction, and that's the canary in the mine.\n\"It's not just birds that are at risk of extinction, these are a symptom of something much greater.\"",
