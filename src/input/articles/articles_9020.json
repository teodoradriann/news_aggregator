    "text": "Une nouvelle vidéo du président américain Joe Biden, prise hors contexte lors des commémorations entourant le 80e anniversaire du débarquement de Normandie en France, a été largement diffusée par ses opposants dans les réseaux sociaux afin d’attaquer ses capacités cognitives en vue de la présidentielle. • À lire aussi: VIDÉO | Brigitte Macron cause un malaise en tentant de prendre la main de la reine Camilla On peut y voir le politicien octogénaire se pencher, comme s’il tentait de s’asseoir sur une chaise invisible. «C’est vraiment troublant. Le président Biden essaie de trouver une chaise invisible pour s’asseoir dessus. C’est triste et gênant pour tous ceux qui sont venus rendre hommage aux hommes courageux qui sont morts pour protéger notre nation des gouvernements tyranniques», raconte un internaute dans le réseau social X. Or, si on se fie aux images captées avant la vidéo, on peut voir une chaise située derrière le président américain. Dans la séquence qui suit l’extrait devenu viral, on peut également voir Joe Biden s’asseoir après s’être penché pendant quelques secondes.",

Proven do-it-yourself techniques are being commonly applied throughout the nation.\nYou will require to do your research study about the different types of renewable resource to utilize. Lots of individuals are benefiting from solar energy and even some are capturing onto wind power. Do some research study and identify which source will work best for you.\nCoal is formed through the dead remains of trees, ferns and other plants that lived 300 to 400 million years ago. Swamps would form, which would be covered by the sea. The sea itself consists of a large amount of sulphur, which winds up in the coal when the water receded. If sulphur isn't gotten rid of first, it is released when coal is burned, although it does depend upon where exactly the coal originates from.\nAfter all, if they desire live far from the power grid, they will have to invest at least twenty thousand dollars on the PV power setup, depending upon the size of their house. And oftentimes, they can just see a full return on their financial investment after 20 years. This is method too long.\nThe reality is, our non-renewable resources are disappearing quick. We each can start to make a difference by merely taking a look at solar energy and wind energy as an alternative source of power. It's excellent for the earth and your pocket.

If we don't alter, our own greed will cause our death. That's fantastic to think about. The dinosaurs were supposedly extinct by a meteor; they had no chance. Do you think they would have killed themselves if they had the opportunity? Of course not. Only humans even understand the principle of greed.",

We forwarded it to the state government, but no action was taken in the matter.” A team of NCPCR and Child Welfare Committee reached the school to inquire about the matter. After three hours of probe, the statements of the victim students were recorded and found the complaint true. The investigation team reached the city police station and registered a case. Child Welfare Committee chairman Prem Singh Dhakad said, “Two children have recorded written statements confirming the incident. They informed us that they were thrashed by calling on the stage by school principal.” Talking to local media persons, the school’s principal, Sister Reena said, “The students had acted against the discipline of the school and a minor punishment was given to them.” Police have startedan investigation into the matter.
