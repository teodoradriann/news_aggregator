    "text": "El fenómeno es de corta duración y tiene potencia de ser el más fuerte del año.\nComo ya es una costumbre para los aficionados a la observación estelar, las Cuadrántidas será la primera lluvia de estrellas del año, que con el cielo nocturno dejará apreciar hasta 120 estrellas fugaces por hora, en cuanto la atmósfera terrestre arribe al lugar en el que flotan en el espacio los restos del asteroide 2003 EH.\nDe acuerdo información del sitio space.com la primera lluvia de estrellas del año será visible en la noche del 3 al 4 de enero de 2024, con un periodo que no supera las seis horas, debido a que la Tierra cruza rápidamente los restos del cometa y es por eso que las Cuadrántidas duran poco tiempo.\nLas Cuadrántidas tienen el potencial de ser la lluvia de estrellas más fuerte de 2024 y según EarthSky, el pico previsto es a partir de las 4:53 am (hora del Este) y hasta que amanezca.\nUn cuarto de luna alumbrará la noche, por lo que no se recomienda que los observadores estelares realicen viajes con la búsqueda de cielos oscuros para apreciar el evento, sin embargo, los mejores lugares para ver el fenómeno son las regiones occidentales de Estados Unidos, con la esperanza de que la luz de la luna permita que las bolas de fuego de las Cuadrántidas sean más brillantes y se puedan detectar.\nLa tasa de Cuadrántidas es reconocida por la NASA como una de las más intensas a lo largo del año, con una frecuencia de más de 100 por hora desde un punto que se acerca a la Estrella del Norte.\nOrigen de las Cuadrántidas Las Cuadrántidas toman su nombre de la constelación Quadran Muralis, que dejó de ser reconocida por la comunidad científica desde 1920, ya que ahora la mayoría de estrellas forman parte de la constelación del Boyero.\nEsta lluvia de estrellas, cuya fuente es el mencionado cometa 2003 EH1, encontró su punto de origen en el año 2003. La NASA, en diciembre de aquella fecha, Peter Jenniskens, del Centro de Investigación Ames de la NASA, halló pruebas de que guardaba relación con el mencionado cometa, que probablemente se rompió hace 500 años.\nLa lluvia de estrellas Cuadrántidas es menos reconocida que las Gemínidas y las Oriónidas por ser más débiles y más fáciles de perder de vista.",

    "text": "Phil Collins gave fans a rare update about his ailing health in his newly released documentary, “Phil Collins: Drummer First.”\nThe health update comes a full two years after the legendary star retired from drumming. The documentary was released Dec. 18 and takes a deep dive into Collins’ current health condition . He spoke of his inability to continue doing what he’s most passionate about — playing the drums.\n“It’s still kind of sinking in a bit,” he admitted in an interview segment filmed in October 2022. “I’ve spent all my life playing drums. To suddenly not be able to do that is a shock,” Collins said.\nThe 73-year-old singer and musician said he had been playing drums since the age of 5. After several decades, “the drumming has taken its toll on my hands, legs,” he said.\n“If I can’t do what I did as well as I did it, I’d rather relax and not do anything,” Collins said.\nBERLIN, GERMANY – MARCH 07: British singer and drummer Phil Collins of the band Genesis performs live on stage during a concert at Mercedes Benz Arena on March 7, 2022 in Berlin, Germany.

But I just feel like I’ve used up my air miles,” he said.\nCollin’s son Nic spoke about the impact that the Genesis star’s career has had on the drummer’s body . He admitted his father had devoted his life to his music and was now paying the consequences through the toll it took on his physical health.\n“Musicians, people in bands in general had this thought that they were invincible,” Nic said in the documentary.\n“I think that’s really what it is with my dad is just this kind of sense of you’re a drummer, you’re invincible, you do what you do. But you don’t know it’s gonna take a toll in the long run.”\nNic followed in his father’s footsteps by also becoming a drummer. He noted that his father had a “big surgery on his neck [in 2015] that stemmed from all those years playing drums and bad posture.”\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Phil Collins (@officialphilcollins)\nCollins also suffers from drop-foot, where one of his feet has no sensation and requires the use of a cane to walk.

    "text": "Benin-Niger Oil Dispute: Arrests and Allegations Deepen Tensions Authorities in Benin have detained five Niger nationals for allegedly entering a pipeline terminal under false pretenses, escalating a dispute over crude oil exports between the two countries. This comes amidst strained relations following a July 2023 coup in Niger and subsequent sanctions imposed by the regional bloc ECOWAS. [Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Updated: 07-06-2024 02:39 IST | Created: 07-06-2024 02:39 IST A prosecutor in Benin said authorities had detained on Wednesday five Niger nationals for allegedly entering Benin's Seme-Kpodji pipeline terminal under false pretences, deepening a dispute over exports of crude oil from Niger via Benin. In a statement on Thursday, special prosecutor Mario Metonou said the group had entered the terminal clandestinely and accused at least two of the detainees of being agents of Niger's ruling military junta. \"Investigations are ongoing to determine the real motives ... in a context where recurring information suggests the planning of acts against the security of the state of Benin,\" Metonou said. On Thursday, Niger's Oil Minister Mahamane Moustapha Barke Bako rejected the prosecutor's allegations, telling a press conference in Niamey that those arrested were inspectors supervising the loading of crude oil in line with an agreement with Benin. Relations between the West African neighbours have been strained since Benin blocked crude exports via its port from landlocked Niger in May, demanding the junta reopen its border to Benin's goods and normalise relations before shipments can restart. On May 15, Benin provisionally reversed the export block and agreed to hold a meeting between the two countries, but a long-term solution has not yet been agreed. At the Niamey press conference, Nigerien Justice Minister said they would refer the issue to the arbitration court of the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa. The tensions go back to the July 2023 coup in Niger, which led the regional bloc ECOWAS to impose strict sanctions for more than six months. Trade flows in the region were expected to normalise after the bloc lifted sanctions, but Niger has kept its borders closed to goods from Benin. Benin's crude blockade jeopardised Niger's plan to start exports from its Agadem oilfield via the pipeline under a memorandum of understanding with Chinese state-owned oil giant China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) worth $400 million. The nearly 2,000 km (1,243-mile) PetroChina -backed pipeline was officially launched in November linking Niger's Agadem oilfield to Benin's coast.

O ator e a influenciadora teriam criado 235 chaves pix com o objetivo de fraudar a arrecadação de donativos para a região. As informações são do G1. “Esse casal se utilizava de documentos falsos em nome de um casal verdadeiro aqui do Ceará, tem um casal de idosos aqui de Fortaleza também”, explicou o delegado de Crimes Informáticos e Defraudações do Rio Grande do Sul, João Vitor Heredia. O agente ainda deu detalhes de como José e Regina agiam: “Eles pegavam os documentos verdadeiros desse casal e colocavam ali as fotos deles, a partir daí constituíram documento falso e, a partir desse documento falso, criavam contas em bancos. Normalmente, em bancos digitais. A partir dessas contas bancárias criadas com documentos falsos, criavam essas chaves pix”.
