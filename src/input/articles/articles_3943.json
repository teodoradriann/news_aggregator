    "text": "Sticking to the childhood immunization schedule is a vital way to protect your child from many different infections and diseases. These illnesses often spread easily through children and can cause serious health concerns, and even death.\nNo matter the age of your children, vaccines are proven to be one of the best ways to protect them from these illnesses.\nThe childhood immunization schedule provides a way to show when and how often children should get vaccines for their protection.\nMarshfield Clinic Health System and Marshfield Children’s follows the federal\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations. This fortunately allow many of these vaccines to be combined safely in one visit.\nMore vaccines are given than even a few years ago because, as science advances, we can protect your child against more diseases than ever before.\nRELATED ARTICLE: Debunking vaccine myths\nChildhood immunization schedule (newborn to six years old)\nThe ages your child receives their vaccines differ.\n“The childhood immunization schedule was built based on when a child is likely to be exposed to the illness and when the vaccine will be most effective,” said\nDr. Dusan Markovic, pediatrician with Marshfield Children’s. Immunization schedule is as follows:\n- Newborns – Hep B (1st dose)\n- 1-2 months – Hep B (2nd dose)\n- 2 months – DTaP (1st dose), HiB (1st dose), polio (1st dose); pneumococcal (1st dose) and rotavirus (2-dose series) vaccine\n- 4 months – DTaP (2nd dose), HiB (2nd dose), polio (2nd dose); pneumococcal (2nd dose) and rotavirus (2-dose series) vaccine.\n- 6 months – DTaP (3rd dose), HiB (3rd or 4th dose), polio (3rd dose); pneumococcal (3rd dose); rotavirus (needed if you decide 3-dose series) vaccine and Hep B (3rd dose)\n- Yearly Flu vaccine starting at 6 months of age.\n- 8 months or younger – 1 dose of respiratory syncytial virus immunization (for children born during or entering their first RSV season) OR 8-19 months – 1 dose of respiratory virus immunization (for children who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease and entering their second RSV season)\n- 12-15 months – MMR (1st dose); Varicella (1st dose), DTaP (4th dose), HiB (3rd or 4th dose); pneumococcal (4th dose); Hep A (2-dose series)\n- 18 months – Hep A (2-dose series if needed)\n- 4-5 years old – DTaP-IPV (5th dose) and MMR-Varicella (2nd dose)\nChildhood immunizations are safe\n“Vaccines go through rigorous testing and checks to first ensure they can be given safely,” said Dr. Markovic. “It’s safe to give your child each of these vaccines at the recommended ages.”\nDuring your child’s first two years of their life is when they should receive their first doses of most vaccines. However, they might need more than one dose to reach full immunization.\n“Your child can get their vaccines at well-child appointments or most routine office visits,” said Dr. Markovic.\nIf your child missed any vaccines, schedule an appointment with their provider.\nRELATED ARTICLE: Playing catchup: How to handle your child’s missed vaccinations\nOutbreaks can still occur\n“Even though some of the diseases we have vaccinated against for years are no longer common, they could return very easily if we stopped vaccinating,” said Dr. Markovic.\nIt is not uncommon to have outbreaks of\nmeasles, whooping cough (pertussis), chickenpox and other diseases when vaccination rates drop.\nWhile these diseases may seem mild, before immunizations were available, nearly four million people got chickenpox annually in the United States, over 10,500 people were hospitalized and about 150 people died of this disease every year.\nAsk your pediatrician if you have questions or concerns about childhood vaccines or the vaccine schedule.\nFor questions about the immunization schedule, talk to a Marshfield Children’s provider.\n Schedule appointment Message your provider\nRelated Shine365 articles\nMeasles: What you need to know Advice for new parents: Help keep your new baby healthy and safe",

    "text": "COMMENTARY: As 2024 winds down, malware families such as [BlackLotus](https://www.scworld.com/news/microsofts-bootkit-blacklotus-nsa), [Emotet](https://www.scworld.com/brief/more-info-on-emotet-leader-sought-by-international-operation), [Beep](https://www.scworld.com/news/beep-malware-evasion-techniques-rookie-mistakes), and [Dark Pink](https://www.scworld.com/brief/new-dark-pink-apt-attacks-uncovered) continue to present distinct challenges for organizations across various industries.\nEach malware family has been evolving in its tactics, increasingly focusing on evasion and exploiting trusted security mechanisms and understanding their behavior, motivations, and targets is essential for strengthening defenses.\nHere’s a rundown of these threats and insights for mitigating their risks:\n- BlackLotus: The Bootkit Maverik.\nBlackLotus has become the first known malware to bypass Secure Boot, targeting the unified extensible firmware interface (UEFI) layer of modern Windows systems. By embedding itself in firmware, it evades standard detection and persists through reboots. This deep system compromise lets attackers maintain long-term access for espionage, sabotage, or ransomware operations.\n[SC Media Perspectives columns are written by a trusted community of SC Media cybersecurity subject matter experts. [Read more Perspectives here](https://www.scworld.com/perspective).]\nPreviously theoretical, BlackLotus brings UEFI bootkits into reality by bypassing Secure Boot protections. Its use of anti-analysis features makes it difficult to detect, and its cross-platform capabilities threaten industries reliant on system uptime and security, such as critical infrastructure, financial services, and healthcare.\nBlackLotus targets the foundational layers of system security, rendering traditional defenses ineffective. It poses a significant threat to sectors with high regulatory and security demands such as government, finance, and defense. Its ability to persist undetected in highly-sensitive environments signals an escalation in firmware-level attacks, demanding that intelligence agencies and private organizations reassess hardware and firmware security measures.\nTo defend against BlackLotus, organizations should prioritize UEFI updates, implement firmware security controls, and conduct regular system audits. Multi-factor authentication and hardware-based security, like trusted platform modules (TPMs), are crucial.\nEmotet: The Persistent Phisher\nEmotet, once a banking trojan, has evolved into a versatile malware platform, spreading through phishing emails with malicious attachments. Emotet also acts as a delivery mechanism for other malware, including ransomware, embedding itself into legitimate business conversations through email hijacking.\nThe malware’s role in email hijacking and social engineering tactics have grown more sophisticated, making phishing emails harder to detect. Industries reliant on communication, such as financial services and legal sectors, are particularly vulnerable.\nEmotet’s role as a malware delivery platform and its ability to embed itself in trusted email threads make it a significant intelligence threat, especially in industries where data confidentiality remains critical. Intelligence teams should monitor its partnerships with other malware operators, as Emotet often serves as a gateway for larger ransomware or data exfiltration campaigns.\nOrganizations should strengthen phishing defenses, tighten email filtering, and train users to recognize suspicious emails. Limiting macro use and attachment handling can reduce exposure.\nBeep: The Silent Intruder\nBeep malware has been designed for stealth, employing techniques like sleep functions to delay execution and avoid sandboxing. It delivers malware payloads through modular components, allowing attackers to customize attacks based on the target environment. Beep has enhanced its modularity, making it easier to deploy diverse malware payloads. It primarily targets Windows-based enterprise systems in industries like retail, logistics, and manufacturing, which may lack rigorous endpoint monitoring.\nThe malware's focus on evasion and modularity poses a challenge for traditional detection methods. It represents a growing trend of malware-as-a-service (MaaS) that multiple threat actors could leverage for espionage or ransomware campaigns. Its stealth capabilities are particularly concerning for industries managing sensitive data or intellectual property.\nSecurity teams should invest in behavioral analysis tools and monitor network traffic for anomalies. Strengthening endpoint detection with anti-evasion mechanisms will help mitigate Beep’s risks.\nDark Pink: The Asia Pacific Espionage Specialist\nDark Pink, also known as the Saaiwc group, is an APT espionage group. Operating mainly in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region, Dark Pink targets government agencies, military organizations, and non-government organizations (NGOs) through spear-phishing emails and techniques like DLL side-loading.\nThe malware has expanded its target base to include research organizations and private-sector businesses in critical industries like energy and technology. Their malware now uses cloud-based services and encrypted communication channels, complicating detection.\nDark Pink’s focus on espionage, especially in geopolitically sensitive regions, raises national security concerns. Its shift to targeting energy and technology sectors indicates a broader intelligence strategy aimed at gaining strategic advantages through data theft. Intelligence agencies and cybersecurity teams should prioritize monitoring its activities, particularly in high-risk regions.\nSecurity teams should strengthen defenses against spear-phishing and monitor for unusual file activity. Government agencies and businesses in critical sectors should enhance protections against espionage-driven malware.\nHow to set priorities for malware defense\nThe evolving tactics of BlackLotus, Emotet, Beep, and Dark Pink highlight the critical need for a proactive, intelligence-driven defense strategy. To address these challenges, organizations should first prioritize securing UEFI and firmware settings while also updating their hardware-level defenses.\nFurthermore, it’s essential to strengthen phishing detection and enhance user training, particularly in communication-heavy industries where the risk is heightened. In addition, teams need to invest in behavioral and anomaly detection to catch stealthy malware like Beep.\nFinally, organizations in critical sectors, especially those operating in geopolitically sensitive regions, must enhance their defenses against espionage threats. By understanding the behavior and evolution of these malware families, security teams can effectively anticipate and mitigate the risks posed by these advanced threats.\nCallie Guenther, senior manager, cyber threat research, Critical Start\nSC Media Perspectives columns are written by a trusted community of SC Media cybersecurity subject matter experts.

    "title": "Work Conditions Of J.D. Vance’s Kentucky Startup Labeled A ‘Nightmare’",
    "text": "CNN reports that the workplace conditions at GOP vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance’s former startup, AppHarvest, are described as a “nightmare.”\nAfter facing hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, AppHarvest declared bankruptcy in 2023, and dozens of former employees labeled their experience as less than pleasurable as Vance vowed to help the working-class Kentuckians. Public documents and interviews reveal employees were forced to work in grueling conditions inside the company’s greenhouse as temperatures soared into the triple digits.\nSeveral complaints were filed with the US Department of Labor and a Kentucky regulator between 2020 and 2023, alleging workers were given limited water breaks at the startup and barely provided adequate safety gear. Some workers admitted to having suffered from heat exhaustion or injuries. However, state inspectors never found violations.\nAccording to the New Republic, former AppHarvest worke r Anthony Morgan accused the company of forcing him and co-workers to work on a 128-degree day. “I think about the hottest that I experienced was around 128 degrees,” Morgan said. “A couple days a week, you’d have an ambulance show up, and you’d see people leaving on gurneys to go to the hospital.”\nMorgan said things were going great when he was first hired, and then things changed. Production started falling behind, and workers were pressured to step it up. Then, the company cut employee healthcare benefits and other costs, but hours were increased, and breaks decreased.\nVance invested in several Silicon Valley startups after the success of his 2016 memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy.” During a Fox News interview, AppHarvest Founder Jonathan Webb said that the Ohio litigator gave him a $150,000 check to invest in AppHarvest while other investors invested $50,000 each. The startup caught Vance’s eye because of his guiding principles, claiming a business should not only turn a profit but also help American communities, as the reason behind his decision to invest.\nAs a food production company, AppHarvest promised a high-tech future for the farming community of Eastern Kentucky. Vance jumped on board early on as an investor, board member, and public pitchman for the indoor agriculture company. “It’s not just a good investment opportunity, it’s a great business that’s making a big difference in the world,” Vance said during a 2021 Fox Business interview on the same day the company went public in February.\nWhile the company promised to hire within Kentucky lines, eventually, migrant workers from Mexico, Guatemala, and other countries were contracted. Then, in 2021, when Vance stepped down to launch his political bid for Ohio senator, the company started to drown in lawsuits filed by shareholders who were furious over plummeting stock prices and fraud allegations. Former employees wanted Vance and other board members to be held accountable for turning their back after misleading the public and their own investors. “Eastern Kentucky is well-known for people coming and going. They start up companies, then they disappear,” former AppHarvest worker Morgan said.\n“They didn’t care about us.”\nLuke Schroeder, a spokesperson for Vance, released a statement saying the politician “was not aware of the operational decisions regarding hiring, employee benefits, or other workplace policies which were made after he departed AppHarvest’s board” and said he simply wanted the company to thrive. “Like all early supporters, JD believed in AppHarvest’s mission and wishes the company would have succeeded,” the statement read.\nRELATED CONTENT: J.D.
