    "text": "Arsenal fail in Premier League summit bid as Spurs lose thriller Arsenal missed out on the chance to return to the Premier League summit on Thursday, losing 2-0 to West Ham as Tottenham went down in a six-goal thriller at Brighton. Mikel Arteta's Gunners were top of the tree at Christmas for a second successive year but trail leaders Liverpool by two points at the halfway point of the season. Last year's runners-up dominated possession at the Emirates but lacked a cutting edge against the disciplined visitors, for whom Tomas Soucek and former Arsenal player Konstantinos Mavropanos scored the goals. Soucek opened the scoring from close range in the 13th minute following a pass from Jarrod Bowen, with the goal confirmed after a lengthy VAR check looking into whether the ball had gone out of play. Arsenal surged forward in relentless waves and West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola made a fine reaction save from a Bukayo Saka header on the half-hour. The England winger hit the post from a tight angle as the clock ticked down towards half-time but Arsenal trailed at the break despite enjoying nearly three-quarters of possession. The Gunners came out determined to find a response but instead they found themselves 2-0 down when Mavropanos's bullet header cannoned in off the crossbar from James Ward-Prowse's corner. Gabriel Jesus failed to beat Areola with a header when well-placed and shortly afterwards missed another glorious opportunity with his head at the back post. Arsenal continued to bombard the visitors' goal but could not find a breakthrough and it could have been worse had Said Benrahma managed to convert a late penalty. Defeat leaves the Gunners in second place on 40 points, one clear of Aston Villa and three ahead of Manchester City, who have a game in hand. Arteta said his team deserved more for their dominance. \"We want to be at the top and today we are very, very disappointed,\" he told the BBC. \"We had so much dominance in the game. We are in a really good position. Today is a disappointing night. We have to pick ourselves up for a big game against Fulham.\" He added: \"The players put an enormous effort in. It's a difficult dressing room right now but we have another game in 72 hours. This is football, we have to improve in certain areas.\" West Ham manager David Moyes celebrated his team's rise to sixth in the table. \"We are not one of the top teams,\" he told Amazon Prime. \"We are trying to get up and grow the team. For West Ham to be in Europe (they topped their Europa League group) is a great period.\" Spurs drama Tottenham, this season's early pacesetters, remain in fifth spot after losing 4-2 despite threatening an astonishing comeback from 4-0 down against Roberto De Zerbi's Brighton. Jack Hinshelwood finished with brutal power to put the home side ahead following a weaving run from Joao Pedro along the edge of the penalty area. Brighton doubled their lead from the penalty spot in the 23rd minute through Pedro, who took full advantage after Dejan Kulusevski was penalised for a pull on Welbeck. Brazil forward Richarlison twice had the ball in the net after the break but both times he was ruled offside. Pervis Estupinan stretched the lead with a thunderbolt from 30 yards in the 63rd minute and Pedro scored a second penalty 12 minutes later. Alejo Veliz grabbed what appeared to be a consolation goal in the 81st minute but it galvanised the visitors. Ben Davies headed home Pedro Porro's deep cross as Spurs threatened to cut through every time they poured forward, with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg hitting the post during nine frantic minutes of stoppage time. But Brighton withstood the intense pressure to take all three points. \"I am really lucky to be this coach of this team with these players,\" De Zerbi told the BBC. \"I am very pleased with the passion they have, they have everything. \"You can't forget we are Brighton. Sometimes they forget we are Brighton. We are not Manchester United, Manchester City, Newcastle or Arsenal, we are still Brighton.\"",

    "text": "Partnership Provides Free WiFi Access, Plus a $500,000 Grant for a Technology Makeover That Will Enable Virtual Digital Skills Training Across the State of Georgia\nATLANTA , Oct. 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Comcast announced today it has installed its first Flagship Lift Zone in partnership with Inspiredu in Atlanta, Georgia . Building on the legacy of its award-winning Lift Zone program, which now offers free WiFi in more than 1,250 community centers nationwide, this inaugural Flagship Lift Zone continues five years of proud collaboration between Comcast and Inspiredu. Not only will Inspiredu still provide free, fast, and reliable WiFi for visitors, powered by Comcast Business, but also expand its reach and capacity with a grant of more than $500,000 . The investment will fund a technology makeover as well as the ability to deliver even more digital skills training classes.\nContinue Reading\nRibbon cutting at Comcast’s first Flagship Lift Zone at Inspiredu in Atlanta - (L-R) Raymond Smeriglio, Comcast; Bridget Thorne, Fulton County Commissioner; Melinda Little, Comcast South, VP Government Affairs; Mike McArdle, Comcast South, Regional Senior Vice President; Richard Hicks, Inspiredu, CEO & President; Loren Hudson, Comcast SVP & Chief Diversity Officer; Doug Shipman, President of City Council of Atlanta; Courtney English, Senior Chief Policy Officer & Senior Advisor to Mayor of Atlanta Andre Dickens\n\"Lift Zones are about more than just providing free access to the Internet. They are about teaching people how to use the power of broadband to transform their lives and careers,\" said Loren Hudson , SVP and Chief Diversity Officer, Connectivity and Platforms, Comcast. \"The biggest barrier to getting online is not having the skills or the resources to do so. With this Flagship Lift Zone, Inspiredu will now be able to make an even greater impact.\"\nComcast's Lift Zones program, a key component of Project UP, is part of the company's comprehensive, $1 billion commitment to advance digital equity and build a future of unlimited possibilities. Since its launch in 2020, Lift Zones have provided essential internet access for those in need outside the home. It also complements Comcast's Internet Essentials program, which offers in-home broadband connectivity to lower-income families.\n\"These resources will help us expand our reach not just in our local community, or even in the greater Atlanta metro area. Now, we'll be able to provide digital skills training classes remotely to anyone, anywhere in the great state of Georgia ,\" said Richard Hicks , CEO & President of Inspiredu. \"Given Comcast's focus on the Internet and ensuring that everyone has the skills to navigate it, I can think of no greater partner for us at Inspiredu.\"\n\"This Flagship Lift Zone represents the next step in our long-standing partnership with Inspiredu to bridge the digital divide here in Atlanta ,\" said Mike McArdle , Senior Vice President of Comcast's Big South Region. \"By providing free, high-speed Internet access and technology resources, we're empowering even more Atlantans to learn, grow and connect to opportunities that can transform their lives. We're proud to further our work with Inspiredu and invest in creating a brighter digital future for our communities.\"\nTechnology Makeover Comcast and Inspiredu collaborated to develop a customized plan to ensure the organization could expand its reach through the use of state-of-the-art technology. As Inspiredu was already making a significant capital investment to upgrade its facilities, Comcast was able to partner early in that planning process to ensure WiFi access points with increased reliability and speed were installed throughout the facility. In addition, other tech upgrades funded by Comcast include:\nDigital cameras and whiteboards in two fully connected classrooms equipped with four 85-inch Yealink screens to offer both in-person and hybrid instruction. A Muraflex wall that can transform the classroom area into a spacious room for up to 50 students, two smaller rooms for up to 25 students, or a fully open space to accommodate large, community events. Two 85-inch television screens to display real-time updates, special announcements, upcoming events, and daily class schedules. Enhanced audio-visual and design in the huddle rooms, designed for up to four people to enable Inspiredu staff to deliver digital navigator counseling sessions in a private setting. Digital Skills Training Part of Comcast's investment will also enable Inspiredu to hire more instructors, doubling the number of teachers from four to eight. This allows Inspiredu to teach both large format classes, as well as offer a greater variety of smaller, more specialized courses around topics like cyber security, financial literacy, and coding.\nOver the last three years, Comcast has made more than $47.9 million in cash and in-kind contributions to more than 70 Georgia-based nonprofit organizations. These contributions support local community programs that help establish and promote the company's Digital Equity Network in Georgia . Comcast's network of digital equity partners helps people acquire computers, provide digital skills trainings, and offer opportunities for community members to explore and train for careers in tech-related fields. They can also develop the kinds of digital skills that can help them launch and grow their own business.\nAbout Inspiredu Inspiredu is a Georgia -based non-profit working to bridge the gaps in device ownership, digital literacy, and digital access by providing Georgia's most marginalized and vulnerable citizens with the devices and training they need to join the global internet community. In Inspiredu's digital skilling workshops, participants learn fundamental technical skills such operating the computer and accessing the internet, practicing internet safety, using basic software such as Microsoft Office, understanding how to use technology to increase financial wellness or acquire certifications to bolster work readiness, and understanding how to use online resources to support student learning. The communities that Inspiredu serves, both rural and urban, are families of meager or lower incomes who lack the devices and training necessary to take advantage of recent broadband initiatives in Georgia .

    "text": "L’Italia sta vivendo la giornata più calda dell’anno nelle Regioni del Centro/Nord: la temperatura ha raggiunto valori ragguardevoli in pianura Padana con +35°C a Milano, Bologna e Verona, ma soprattutto +38°C a Imola e Faenza. Mai, quest’anno, la colonnina di mercurio era arrivata così in alto, anche se comunque non parliamo di valori minimamente vicini ai record storici locali. Fa molto caldo – anche in questo caso affatto eccezionale rispetto ai picchi assoluti – nelle Regioni del Centro, con +38°C a Terni, +37°C a Firenze, Perugia e Viterbo, +36°C a Roma, Latina, Frosinone e Rieti.\nSituazione molto diversa al Sud, dove tutto sommato è una normalissima giornata estiva con temperature massime di +32°C a Palermo, Bari, Catania, Messina e Lecce, +31°C a Taranto e Brindisi. Splende comunque il sole, a differenza dell’Europa Centrale flagellata dal maltempo provocato dalla tempesta denominata Larissa : sta provocando forti temporali tra Belgio , Paesi Bassi , Lussemburgo , Germania , Francia , Svizzera e Austria , dove sono in corso veri e propri nubifragi con grandine e raffiche di saette molto pericolose. Spettacolari le immagini dai satelliti:\nQuesto maltempo si intensificherà ulteriormente nel corso del pomeriggio-sera di oggi: i temporali si estenderanno a gran parte della Germania, ma interesseranno anche l’area alpina tra Svizzera, Austria e Nord Italia, con fenomeni estremi in Trentino Alto Adige , Veneto e Friuli Venezia Giulia dove si verificheranno i primi forti nubifragi:\nAllerta Meteo per venerdì 2 agosto Domani, venerdì 2 agosto, il maltempo continuerà a colpire l’Europa centrale: in mattinata i temporali in Germania diventeranno davvero furiosi nel cuore del Paese, ma il maltempo interesserà anche Repubblica Ceca e Austria :\nNel pomeriggio-sera avremo fenomeni estremi anche nel Sud/Ovest della Polonia e in generale sui Balcani . Ma attenzione al Nord Italia: i temporali si intensificheranno ulteriormente con un primo calo delle temperature significativo in serata su tutto il settentrione. Sarà un pomeriggio-sera temporalesco anche nel nord/est della Spagna , in modo particolare in Catalogna.\nAllerta Meteo per sabato 3 agosto Sabato sarà la giornata clou per il maltempo in Italia: le temperature crolleranno sensibilmente in tutto il Centro/Nord, mentre persisterà ancora il caldo al Sud. Il crollo termico sarà accompagnato da forte maltempo con piogge e temporali particolarmente violenti in Emilia Romagna, nelle Marche ma anche in Veneto, Liguria, Toscana, Umbria e Sardegna:\nNel pomeriggio il maltempo insisterà su Marche , Umbria e Toscana , estendendosi anche al Sud, con temporali pomeridiani in Sicilia, ancora in un contesto di caldo nell’Italia meridionale.\nAllerta Meteo per domenica 4 agosto Domenica 4 agosto la rinfrescata si estenderà anche al Centro/Sud, con forti temporali pomeridiani lungo la dorsale appenninica. L’instabilità persisterà in tutt’Italia anche la prossima settimana, seppur in un contesto di temperature miti, caldo tipicamente estivo senza grandi eccessi, e ampie schiarite con prevalente bel tempo.\nPer monitorare nel modo migliore possibile la situazione meteo in tempo reale, di seguito forniamo un elenco delle pagine con tutte le informazioni utili per seguire il nowcasting meteorologico minuto per minuto:\nSatelliti Satelliti Animati Situazione Fulminazioni Radar Di seguito i link per l’accesso diretto alle pagine con le previsioni meteo, particolarmente accurate nei dettagli, per le aree geografiche d’Italia (link sempre raggiungibili anche dal Menù in alto in tutte le pagine del sito):\nNord Italia Centro Italia Sud e Isole Le Previsioni Meteo Regione per Regione: Lombardia Lazio Campania Veneto Sicilia Emilia Romagna Piemonte Puglia Toscana Calabria Sardegna Liguria Marche Abruzzo Friuli Venezia Giulia Trentino Alto Adige Umbria Basilicata Molise Valle d’Aosta",

    "text": "“Star Wars: The Bad Batch” sigue con su apasionante historia y tiene todo listo para el gran final Tras el doceavo capítulo, solo quedan unos pocos episodios para ponerle fin a la historia que cada vez va siendo más profunda y oscura. El emocionante final de la temporada 3 de Star Wars: The Bad Batch está cada vez más cerca, y los fanáticos están ansiosos por ver cómo culminará el viaje de los clones mutantes en esta serie animada de [Disney+](https://www.disneyplus.com/es-cl). Ya superada la mitad de la actual y última tanda de episodios, la historia se va poniendo cada vez más emocionante y se va destapando el lado oscuro que hay detrás de todas las aventuras que ha vivido la Fuerza Clon 99 junto a Omega, que resultó ser la verdadera protagonista de todo. Al día de hoy hay 12 capítulos disponibles de esta tercera parte (44 en total), y a lo largo de estas semanas hemos visto momentos muy vibrantes, como el [regreso de un popular personaje](https://www.adnradio.cl/2024/03/28/star-wars-el-nuevo-episodio-de-the-bad-batch-trajo-de-regreso-a-un-popular-personaje-que-podria-suponer-una-nueva-historia-por-explorar/). Pero también se le ha dado mayor profundidad y tensión al rol de la joven clon femenina, que resultó ser mucho más importante de lo que se esperaba, siendo de especial interés para el Imperio. Bajo la misma línea, es interesante ver cómo el ritmo de la serie ha acelerado notablemente en los últimos lanzamientos, con giros inesperados y momentos pegados a la pantalla. La dinámica entre los personajes, especialmente entre Crosshair y Omega, ha alcanzado un nuevo nivel, añadiendo una capa adicional de complejidad a la narrativa. Además, el desarrollo de personajes como la Dra. Emerie y el Dr. Hemlock ha agregado un elemento oscuro y perturbador a la historia, explorando los horrores del trabajo del Imperio y sus experimentos. Así, a medida que nos acercamos al final de la temporada, los fanáticos esperan ansiosos las respuestas a varias preguntas pendientes, como el destino de los clones defectuosos que han forjado lazos especiales; qué pasará con la joven clon; la forma en que se da la transición de poder en la galaxia abriéndole paso al emperador Palpatine y en qué posición quedan los protagonistas de la serie. Tras el estreno del capítulo nº12, titulado Colosal, solo quedan 3 episodios más, teniendo como término el próximo 1 de mayo. De esta manera, lo que está por venir en Star Wars: The Bad Batch estará a un gran nivel y dará mucho de qué hablar entre los fanáticos. De todas formas, a pesar de que nos acercamos al final definitivo del título, es muy probable que se sigan explorando algunas historias que desprenden de acá, ya sea en libros, cómics, videojuegos o incluso nuevos proyectos spin-off.
