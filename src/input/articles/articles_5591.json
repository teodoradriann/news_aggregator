    "text": "Rentiere durch Klimawandel stark gefährdet – Population schrumpft drastisch\nRentiere stehen im Norden von Schweden am Straßenrand. Der Klimawandel bedroht Lebensräume von Rentieren.\nQuelle: Steffen Trumpf/dpa\nKopenhagen/Adelaide. Rentiere sind durch den Klimawandel stark gefährdet. Es gibt bereits fast zwei Drittel weniger Rentiere als noch vor 30 Jahren und die heutige Population könnte bis zum Ende des Jahrhunderts um 58 Prozent reduziert werden, wie aus einer in der Fachzeitschrift „Science Advances“ veröffentlichten Studie hervorgeht. Möglich ist dieser große künftige Verlust, wenn die Menge an Treibhausgas-Emissionen so hoch wie aktuell bleibt.\nLaut den Ergebnissen des internationalen Forschungsteams unter Leitung der Universitäten im dänischen Kopenhagen und im australischen Adelaide wäre der Rückgang der Rentierbestände in einzelnen Regionen besonders drastisch: Bleibt der Emissionswert gleich hoch, könnte es 84 Prozent weniger Rentiere in Nordamerika bis zum Jahr 2100 geben.\nSelbst bei einem Emissionsszenario mit moderaten Annahmen könnte die Rentierpopulation in Nordamerika noch um bis zu 42 Prozent schrumpfen. Der Süden Asiens könnte seine Rentierbestände komplett verlieren.\nSeltene Riesenfische geben Tuvalu neue Hoffnung\nBedroht von steigenden Meeren entdeckt Tuvalu einen Schatz in der Tiefe: riesige Schwärme seltener Lippfische. Ein Symbol der Hoffnung – und ein Plädoyer für den Schutz der Ozeane.\nRentierbestand würde unter sichere Überlebensgrenze fallen\nDie Forschenden haben anhand von Fossilien, genetischen Daten und aufwendigen Modellen die Bestandsentwicklung der Art über 21.000 Jahre rekonstruiert und in die Zukunft projiziert. Der Rentierbestand weltweit würde demnach weit unter die sichere Überlebensgrenze sinken.\nDas Team um Hauptautorin Elisabetta Canteri erläutert laut Mitteilung: „Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass dringend mehr in die Bewirtschaftung und den Schutz der Rentierpopulationen investiert werden muss.“ Dies sei nicht nur für den Erhalt der Art und ihrer Rolle im arktischen Ökosystem entscheidend, sondern auch für die kulturelle, wirtschaftliche und emotionale Lebensgrundlage vieler indigener Gemeinschaften.\nDie Forschenden betonen, dass die prognostizierten Rückgänge in Nordamerika und weiten Teilen des Verbreitungsgebietes in den letzten 21.000 Jahren beispiellos wären.\nRND/dpa",

A heavy ban has lined up in our area bringing heavy, wet snow leading to slippery roads and little to no visibility. This activity will continue over the next several hours and conditions under the heavy ban are expected to deteriorate. Avoid traveling if you can. Totals near I-88 will be lower with an inch of slushy accumulations still possible. This all will move out into the late afternoon ahead of a dry evening. Sunny skies return for Saturday as temperatures remain in the 30s. There is a low chance for snow into Saturday night with a better chance moving in late Sunday. A rain and snow mix is possible with mostly widespread rain expected into Monday. Breeze winds will also arrive with winds gusting up to 35 mph.

    "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited/TotalEnergies joint venture has achieved zero routine gas flare in all its assets, NNPCL announced on Thursday.\nIt said the achievement was in pursuit of meeting the targets of 20 per cent (unconditional) and 47 per cent (conditional) greenhouse gas emission reduction as contained in the Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Accord signed by the President Bola Tinubu administration\nThis feat was announced on Thursday during an inspection tour of OML 100 in South-eastern Niger Delta, off Port Harcourt, by a joint NNPC Ltd and TotalEnergies team to ascertain the success of the OML flare reduction project launched in December 2023,” NNPCL stated in a statement issued in Abuja by its spokesperson, Olufemi Soneye.\nIt added, “The NNPC Ltd/TotalEnergies joint venture, which is the concession holder of four leases, had hitherto achieved zero routine flaring across OML 99 (2006), OML 102 (2014), and OML 58 (2016), leaving OML 100 as the only lease with routine flaring going on.\n“The significance of this achievement is that the last routine flare volume of about 12MMscf/d (12 million standard cubic feet per day) of gas has now been eliminated giving rise to a greenhouse gas emissions reduction of about 341KtCO2e/yr.”\nThe national oil company said the achievement was an outcome of a programme introduced by the NNPCL to galvanise action towards achieving the zero routine flare by 2030 across its portfolio of assets.\n“It is also a testament to NNPC Ltd’s prioritisation of sustainability anchored on the ‘first R’ of its 5R strategy (Reduce, Replace, Renew, Re-plant, Repurpose), as it strives to reduce its carbon footprint.\n“Work is ongoing across all other assets within NNPC Ltd’s upstream directorate to ensure that all assets achieve zero routine flaring by 2030 or earlier,” the oil firm stated.\nNigeria’s efforts to reduce gas flaring have recorded progress and challenges. Nigeria, once the second-largest gas flarer globally, has taken several steps to address this issue, with mixed results\nIn terms of progress, Nigeria reduced gas flaring by around 70 per cent between 2000 and 2018 and has implemented various policy initiatives.\nIts National Gas Policy promotes gas sector development and gas utilisation, while the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme, launched in 2016, aims to end routine flaring by 2020, though this is a missed target.\nThe Flare Gas (Prevention of Waste and Pollution) Regulations, 2018, increased financial penalties for flaring, while the Updated Nationally Determined Contribution committed to a 20 per cent unconditional and 47 per cent conditional reduction in gas flaring by 2030.\nHowever, Nigeria’s ambitious goal of ending routine flaring by 2020 was not achieved, flaring often occurs in remote areas, making gas utilisation projects expensive.\nAttracting sufficient investment for gas utilisation projects has remained a challenge, as an unstable domestic gas demand and limited access to electricity hinder gas project viability.\nNigeria acknowledges the need for further action and is revising its gas strategy.\nThe World Bank and other international organisations are providing support. Achieving zero routine flaring by 2030 remains a significant challenge.\nHowever, gas flaring has severe environmental and economic consequences, and reducing it is crucial for Nigeria’s development. Successful reduction requires collaboration between government, oil companies, investors and communities.\nTotalEnergies EP Nigeria Limited says it has finally achieved zero-routine gas flaring in running its operations in Nigeria, while also investing in renewable energy sources to end greenhouse gas emission.\nMeanwhile, the Managing Director of the energy firm, Matthieu Bouyer, said TotalEnergies Nigeria achieved what he called routine gas flare-out in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Environment, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited.\n“Routine flare-out is the stoppage of continuous gas flaring above the nominal safety capacity of an oil and gas facility. Today, we are proud to be the first company in Nigeria to have stopped routine flaring from all our facilities. We continue to pioneer in energy as we started to do 100 years ago,” Bouyer stated.\nAccording to him, the achievement important to TotalEnergies and to Nigeria because the company’s objective is to fully stop routine flaring in by 2030.\n“On that standpoint, we are in advance in Nigeria since we stopped flaring in 2023. By stopping routine flaring, we are able to valorise the gas, thereby creating value for the country.\n“This achievement is one of the practical demonstrations of Total Energies commitment to deliver less carbon-intensive energy to our customers and it also aligns with the Nigerian government’s objective to foster a low carbon economy. In a nutshell, it is more energy for less emissions,” he added.\nHe said the firm in the past years, had 300 to 350 kSm3/d of routine flaring, he noted has now reduced to zero.\nThe MD noted that “previously flared gas was valorised and used for power generation, gas lift to enhance oil and gas production, and the balance exported to Bonny to be liquefied in the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas.\nSpeaking about the future, he informed, “All TotalEnergies new projects have a mandatory non routine flaring design. The rule is that any new project should improve the emissions intensity of our operations. For example, our recent projects such as Egina and Ikike were stared-up without flaring”.\nHe recalled that the firm had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with NNPCL in December 2023 “to support them in their journey to reduce Methane emission with the use of our Airborne Ultra-light Spectrometer for Environmental Application technology”.\nTo reduce gas and liquid fuels consumption, Bouyer explained that TotalEnergies developed energy efficiency technologies by investing in renewables, saying “we use solar technology onshore with a 5 megawatts solar project at our OML58 field. It will contribute to produce a cleaner oil and gas from the field”.",

    "title": "Arsenal oust holders Madrid, draw enough for Inter against Bayern - NewsBreak",
    "text": "Defending champions Real Madrid are out of the Champions League after a 2-1 home defeat to Arsenal, while Inter Milan confirmed their spot in the semi-finals with a 2-2 draw with Bayern Munich on Wednesday. Arsenal will now face Paris Saint-Germain, while Inter will have Barcelona on their way to the final. Arsenal had a 3-0 advantage from the first leg and Bukayo Saka made up for a missed penalty in the first half to give them a 1-0 lead in the 65th minute. Vinicius Junior pulled one back just two minutes later, but Arsenal secured they would continue in the competition when Gabriel Martinelli scored the winner in stoppage time. Bayern were down 2-1 after the first leg, but levelled the tie in the 52nd through Harry Kane. But Inter turned the game around with Lautaro Martinez and former Bayern player Benjamin Pavard. Eric Dier gave Bayern a spark of hope in the 76th, but despite a huge late pressure, the Germans fell one goal short of taking the game to extra-time.",
