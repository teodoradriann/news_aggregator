    "text": "O running back do New Orleans Saints Alvin Kamara corre o risco de perder as próximas partidas, conforme reportou Adam Schefter, da ESPN americana. Segundo fontes do jornalista, uma lesão na virilha tem potencial de encerrar a temporada do atleta mais cedo.\nKamara não finalizou a última partida em decorrência da contusão sofrida contra o Washington Commanders. Ainda assim, o jogador fechou com 12 corridas para 58 jardas e um touchdown.\nO camisa 41 ainda está listado como “questionável” para o jogo contra o Green Bay Packers, Monday Night Football. Segundo o injury report da franquia de Nova Orleans, ele não participou do treino desta quinta-feira (19).\nO head coach interino dos Saints, Darren Rizzi, afirmou que a situação atual do RB é considerada semana a semana. Porém, a lesão aparenta ser mais séria do que previsto.\nNesta temporada, Alvin Kamara acumula 950 jardas terrestres e seis touchdowns, além de média de 4,2 jardas por carregada. O atleta também contribuiu para o jogo aéreo, com 68 recepções para 543 jardas e dois TDs.\nCaso a potencial ausência de Kamara aconteça, os Saints contarão com os running backs Kendre Miller, Jamaal Williams e Jordan Mims para conduzir o jogo terrestre.",

    "text": "Lyon Un contrat à 300 millions d’euros pour moderniser la ligne D du métro\nAvec presque 300 000 utilisateurs quotidiens, elle est la plus fréquentée du réseau de métro lyonnais.\nLa ligne D, longue de presque 13 kilomètres, fait quotidiennement la navette entre l’ouest et l’est de la ville en desservant, à ses deux extrémités, les gares de Vaise et de Vénissieux. Mise en service le 9 septembre 1991 (son premier tronçon transitait alors entre les stations de Gorge de Loup et Grange Blanche), elle fut, un an et quelques couacs plus tard, la première ligne de métro au monde à utiliser un système de pilotage automatique.\n26 nouvelles rames commandées\nToutefois, en 2025, de l’eau a coulé sous le Rhône et cette position de précurseur a fait long feu. Aussi, par voie de communiqué, l’industriel Alstom annonce ce mercredi 30 juillet la signature d’un contrat de plus de 300 millions d’euros avec le Sytral pour mettre en œuvre une modernisation globale de la ligne.\nEn premier lieu sa flotte, avec une commande de ces 26 nouvelles rames permettant cette fois-ci l’interopérabilité des matériels roulants avec sa petite sœur, la ligne B, dont l’automatisation en 2022 avait déjà été confiée au géant du ferroviaire, et la circulation en unités multiples (jusqu’à 4 voitures) afin de s’adapter à une affluence en constante augmentation.\nLa conception de ces rames, présentée comme écoresponsable, n’en oublie pas pour autant le confort utilisateur. Les usagers profiteront ainsi de larges baies vitrées, d’un système de ventilation réfrigérée enfin adapté à la multiplication des épisodes de chaleur, d’un éclairage LED ou encore de multiples écrans d’information voyageurs. Plus important : l’accès aux personnes à mobilité réduite devrait être grandement amélioré.\nDes rames et un système « made in France »\nLe système de pilotage automatique sera lui aussi entièrement rénové, prenant en compte les risques croissants de cyberattaques en « intégrant des technologies de contrôle et de cybersécurité innovante », selon les déclarations de Frédéric Wiscart, président d’Alstom France.\nLes rames et le système de pilotage automatique seront développés et conçus en France, avec une équipe projet basée dans l’agglomération lyonnaise, annonce la communication d’Alstom.\nLe déploiement de ce nouveau matériel roulant doit se faire d’ici 2031 , en complément de celui existant.",

    "title": "Ethereum Leaps As ETH Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Shares Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Simplification Proposal - The Daily Hodl",
    "text": "The leading smart contract platform by volume is seeing a rise in price after its co-founder shared a proposal to simplify its proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism. In a new thread, Ethereum ( [ETH](https://dailyhodl.com/currencies/ethereum/)) co-founder Vitalik Buterin [releases](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1740066206185611594) his proposal on how to improve the top altcoin’s blockchain, saying that it would make the proof-of-stake system “considerably simpler and lighter.” In the [proposal,](https://ethresear.ch/t/sticking-to-8192-signatures-per-slot-post-ssf-how-and-why/17989) Buterin says that the upgrade would boost decentralization and allow regular individuals to partake in staking. However, he notes that the proposal comes at a high cost. “This approach requires the Ethereum chain to process a huge number of signatures (~28,000 today; 1,790,000 post-SSF [single slot finality]) per slot, which is a very high load. Supporting this load entails a lot of technical sacrifices.” According to Buterin, Ethereum’s centralization works against it because if it were to suffer an attack, it would cost the network about 9 million tokens, or $20 billion. “If a 51% attack takes place [on Ethereum], a large fraction of the entire attacking validator set has their deposits slashed. The cost of an attack is at present around 9 million ETH (~$20 billion), and that assumes network synchrony breaks in a way that maximally favors the attacker. I argue that this is a high cost, but it is too high a cost, and we can afford to make some sacrifices in the matter… This is why I advocate a moderate solution: one that makes some sacrifices on validator accountability, but still keeps the amount of total slashable ETH quite high, but in exchange gets us most of the benefits of a smaller validator set.” Buterin concludes that the optimal number of signatures to process per slot for ETH is 8192 as it would make it “much easier for anyone to run a consensus client, and users, staking enthusiasts and others would be able to immediately work off of that assumption.” After the announcement, the price of Ethereum jumped to $2,442. However, it has since stabilized and is trading for $2,370 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.Don't Miss a Beat – [Subscribe](https://dailyhodl.com/join-the-daily-hodl-email-list/)to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check [Price Action](https://dailyhodl.com/crypto-markets/) Follow us on [Telegram](https://t.me/thedailyhodl) Surf [The Daily Hodl Mix](https://dailyhodl.com/daily-hodl-mix) [Check Latest News Headlines](https://dailyhodl.com/news/) Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

    "title": "A Catholic Monk Came Out As ‘Trans.’ Here's How His Diocese Responded.",
    "text": "Transgender ideology has permeated the culture in countless ways in recent years. Townhall has covered how so-called “transgender” athletes have dominated women’s sports and robbed women of awards and opportunities. In other instances , men who think they are women have robbed women of titles in beauty pageants. This week, a Catholic monk came out and said that she is a woman who transitioned to live as a man. She reportedly became a Catholic monk after transitioning. According to multiple reports, Brother Christian Matson, 39, is a “hermit” in the Diocese of Lexington. Matson told Religion News Service that “he” would officially come out as “transgender” on Pentecost Sunday this year. Matson told RNS that she is the first openly transgender person in her position in the Catholic Church. “I am currently based in the Appalachian mountains of eastern Kentucky,” Matson wrote in an email to friends and supporters on Sunday. “I live in a hermitage at the top of a wooded hill, which I share with my German Shepherd rescue, Odie, and with the Blessed Sacrament, which was installed in my oratory shortly before Christmas.” Recommended Matson was reportedly raised Presbyterian and converted to Catholicism in 2010. This conversion happened four years after she transitioned in college to live as a man. “You’ve got to deal with us, because God has called us into this church,” Matson said. “It’s not your church to kick us out of — this is God’s church, and God has called us and engrafted us into it.” Breaking: Brother Christian Matson has come out as transgender. He is believed to be the first openly transgender person in his position in the Catholic Church.— RNS (@RNS) [May 19, 2024] The Diocese of Lexington shared a statement in support of Matson (via CDLex.org ): On Pentecost Sunday, Brother Christian Matson, a professed hermit in the Diocese of Lexington, has made it public that he is a transgender person. Brother Christian has long sought to consecrate his life to Christ in the Church by living the evangelical counsels of poverty, chastity and obedience. He has consistently been accompanied by a competent spiritual director and has undergone formation in the Benedictine tradition. He does not seek ordination, but has professed a rule of life that allows him to support himself financially by continuing his work in the arts and to live a life of contemplation in a private hermitage. Bishop John Stowe, OFM Conv., accepted his profession and is grateful to Brother Christian for his witness of discipleship, integrity and contemplative prayer for the Church. According to the New York Post , the bishop, John Stowe, has been “a leading voice for LGBTQ+ people in the Catholic Church.” “My willingness to be open to him is because it’s a sincere person seeking a way to serve the church. Hermits are a rarely used form of religious life … but they can be either male or female,” Stowe told the RNS. Matson claimed that she did not “have a hidden agenda.” “People can believe that or not,” she said.",

    "text": "Kochi, Feb 23 : The Kerala High Court has quashed the state government's 2015 decision to assign 5.5 hectares of land at Kallodi in Wayanad at Rs 100 per acre to St. George Forane Church, which had encroached on the said land. \"Poor landless tribals are agitating to get lands for their livelihood and agriculture. In such a situation, huge government land is assigned to the respondent (church) invoking the powers of the Land Assignment Act and Rules. I am of the considered opinion that this is not only illegal but infringes the constitutional rights of the tribals including the petitioners. This is nothing but piercing a knife to the hearts of the innocent, ever-smiling tribals in Wayanad,\" the court said. It said that encroachers of government land are not entitled to any equity and there is no public interest to assign a property when there is admitted encroachment. \"There is no vested right in any person to claim assignment on the registry of government land. Encroaching on the government land and making illegal constructions on it will not give any vested right to encroachers. The government land should be allotted to the downtrodden and not to the wealthy and mighty people,\" the court added. However, the court, though quashing the government order that assigned the land to the church, has given an opportunity to it to purchase the property at the present market value. It further pointed out that if the church is not agreeable, then the government must recover the land and distribute it to eligible persons. If the church purchases the land, the entire amount received from the sale must be utilised for the welfare of the tribal community in Wayanad. The court order came on a petition moved by a group of social workers who belong to the landless tribal community in Wayanad. The petitioners pointed out following protests by the tribal community after the starvation deaths of 32 tribals in 2001, a seven-point agreement was reached with the state government which stated that five acres of land would be given to them wherever possible. It was the petitioners that pointed out that the church illegally encroached upon the 5.5 hectares of land in Mananthavady in Wayanad from 1962 onwards. When the state government responded that the assignment of land was based on Rule 24 of the Kerala Land Assignment Rules and did it in public interest, the court asked: \"What is the 'public interest' in this case?\" \"Simply because some educational institutions and religious institutions or cemetery are constructed after the encroachment, the land cannot be assigned stating 'public interest.' Rule 24 has no application at all in this case,\" the court stated, quashing the government orders that assigned the *pattayam* for the land to the church. The court then ordered the State government to file an action taken report within eight months.",

    "text": "STREAMING E SERIE TV\nDazn addio: che succede il 28 febbraio in Italia\nIl canale DAZN su Amazon Prime Video chiude i battenti: la piattaforma americana non vuol il software di tracciamento per misurare la Total Audience delle partite di calcio italiane\nFine della collaborazione tra DAZN e Amazon Prime Video: a partire dal 28 febbraio 2025 dalla piattaforma di streaming americana sparirà il “channel” della piattaforma inglese, lanciato a fine agosto 2024, e chi aveva sottoscritto l’abbonamento al canale, se avrà dei giorni residui, verrà parzialmente rimborsato. Da marzo 2025, invece, questi utenti dovranno scegliere un’altra opzione per vedere DAZN.\nDAZN addio: via da Prime Video\nSecondo quanto riportato da Il Sole 24 Ore, la fine della collaborazione tra DAZN e Amazon è dovuta al rifiuto di Amazon di sottostare alla misurazione degli ascolti da parte di un JIC (Joint Industry Committee) come Auditel.\nQuesto obbligo di misurazione è stato imposto a DAZN in quanto detentrice dei diritti della Serie A. La legge Melandri, revisionata dalla riforma Lotti, stabilisce che l’8% dei proventi dei diritti TV della Serie A sia distribuito in base ai dati di audience certificati Auditel.\nDAZN, quindi, deve farsi misurare da un ente abilitato, perché in base alla sua “Total Audience” (cioè l’audience relativa a tutti i modi disponibili per vedere le partite) vengono ripartiti i proventi dei diritti TV.\nLa metodologia di misurazione di Auditel richiede l’uso di un SDK (Software Development Kit) di tracciamento, che Amazon non ha voluto integrare nella sua piattaforma. Nonostante i tentativi di trovare una soluzione alternativa, la decisione di interrompere la collaborazione è stata presa da Amazon che, a quanto pare, preferisce rinunciare all’accordo con DAZN pur di non “ospitare” nelle sue app un codice di tracciamento gestito da altre società.\nAmazon, dunque, ha iniziato a comunicare ai propri clienti che il canale DAZN non sarà più disponibile su Prime Video dal 28 febbraio 2025. Gli abbonamenti ancora attivi a quella data verranno interrotti e i clienti riceveranno un rimborso per il periodo non usufruito.\nDove vedere DAZN da marzo 2025\nA partire da marzo 2025, gli ex utenti DAZN via Prime Video Channels dovranno trovare un altro modo per vedere la piattaforma specializzata in contenuti sportivi. Per loro fortuna, comunque, le opzioni a disposizione sono davvero numerose.\nPer vedere DAZN su Smart TV è possibile usare l’app disponibile sugli store delle principali marche di Smart TV come Android TV, LG, Panasonic, Samsung Tizen e Hisense TV.\nSu TV non Smart è possibile utilizzare dispositivi esterni, come Chromecast con Google TV, Amazon Fire TV Stick, Fire TV Cube e Apple TV per rendere “intelligenti” i televisori non connessi: si installa l’app di DAZN sul dispositivo esterno, per poi collegare tale dispositivo alla TV via porta HDMI.\nI contenuti DAZN, inoltre, sono fruibili anche da PC desktop e laptop, collegandosi al sito ufficiale tramite un qualuqnue browser, o tramite smartphone e tablet, o via browser o tramite l’app da scaricare da Play Store (Android) o App Store (iOS/iPadOS).\nInfine, gli abbonati Sky Q o Sky Glass hanno a disposizione l’app di DAZN da installare sul decoder.",

I due ragazzi scomparsi una settimana fa, Karol Canu e Giuseppe Contini, la sera di giovedì 25 gennaio, prima di far perdere le loro tracce, hanno cercato di lasciare la città. È una circostanza al vaglio delle forze dell’ordine, gli investigatori stanno sentendo le persone alle quali i due ragazzi avrebbero chiesto un passaggio in auto fuori Olbia. Nessuno, stando a quanto emerge dall’inchiesta, ha accolto la richiesta di Karol e Giuseppe. I due giovani, 17 e 15 anni, avrebbero anche spiegato che per loro era importante andare via da Olbia, per evitare le conseguenze di un fatto del quale, però, non si sa ancora nulla. Le ricerche dei ragazzi spariti nel nulla ormai da una settimana puntano a individuare la causa dell’allontanamento. Ieri, l’avvocato Ivano Iai, legale della madre di Giuseppe Contini, Elisabetta Loriga, ha lanciato un appello: «La signora Loriga auspica che i media diano concreto ausilio alle ricerche in atto, l'incessante impegno delle forze dell'ordine e dei privati rafforzano le speranze di una soluzione. Considerati i pericoli che due minori posso correre in solitudine, la signora Loriga confida anche nella sensibilità delle amministrazioni locali e delle comunità».\nRIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA\nQuesto contenuto è riservato agli utenti abbonati Per continuare a leggere abbonati o effettua l'accesso se sei già abbonato.\n• Accedi agli articoli premium\n• Sfoglia il quotidiano da tutti i dispositivi\nAbbonati subito Sei già abbonato?
