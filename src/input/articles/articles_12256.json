    "text": "May will mark 20 years since I converted to Catholicism. About a month before I was officially received, Pope John Paul II died, and Benedict XVI was elected. The church had been embroiled in scandals related to decades of sexual abuse and the cover-ups thereof, and I was well aware of the flaws of the institution to which I was entering. I was drawn to the faith, despite the flaws, and made the conversion on a warm spring day.\nBut the church of May 2005 is not the church of February 2025, and it's clear people like me are no longer welcome in Pope Francis' Catholic Church. Not only am I 'mentally ill' and 'rigid' for preferring the Latin Mass, but my belief -- like that of fellow convert and Vice President J.D. Vance -- that America has a right to enforce its immigration laws and borders is worth derision and scorn from the United States Council of Catholic Bishops (USCCB).\nAnd not just scorn now, but excommunication:\nDetroit's Archbishop-elect Weisenburger would support “canonical penalties for Catholics who are involved” in implementing President Trump's immigration policy.\n— Fr. Dave Nix (@FrDaveNix)[https://t.co/iHdlpmOnZd][February 18, 2025]\nIf so, what is the 'grave sin' that meets the criterion of excommunication according to\n[Canon 915]?The 19,500 employees of the U. S. Border Control and the 20,000 of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have the job of enforcing the law of securing our national borders. (There are approximately\n[20,000]U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcements Officers. Of the 19,437 Border Agents,[16,605]are assigned to the Southwest Border.) None of these are responsible for our nation's immigration laws or for the administrative policies of implementing them.These are the same agents and officers who, under President Obama, deported a record 2.4 million immigrants between 2009 and 2016. Janet Murguia, the president of the National Council of La Raza called Obama the '\n[Deporter-In-Chief].'Where was the bishop's outrage then, towards President Obama or the ICE and the Border Patrol employees enforcing his policies?\nWhile the article in question is from 2018 (Weisenburger will be made Archbishop of Detroit in March), during Trump's first administration, it's worth revisiting the issue given the very vocal opposition both the USCCB and Pope Francis have raised to President Donald Trump's immigration policies.\nFor those of you who may not understand what excommunication is, it's a 'medicinal penalty' of the Church and can be imposed in two forms: through the canonical process via a bishop or latae sententiae, an 'automatic' excommunication caused by certain actions:\n- Apostates, heretics, and schismatics (can. 1364)\n- Desecration of the Eucharist (can. 1382)\n- A person who physically attacks the pope (can. 1370)\n- A bishop who consecrates another bishop without papal mandate (can. 1387)\n- A priest who violates the seal of the confessional (can. 1386)\n- A person who procures an abortion (can. 1397 §2)\n- Accomplices who were needed to commit an action that has an automatic excommunication penalty (can. 1329)\nSuch an excommunication also requires certain conditions:\n- The individual must be at least sixteen years old.\n- The individual must know that his action was a violation of Church law.\n- The individual must have acted freely without threat of force or grave fear, have the use of reason, and not have acted mistakenly.\nAs I have pointed out before, here is what the Catechism of the Catholic Church says about immigration (emphasis added):\n2241 The more prosperous nations are obliged, to the extent they are able, to welcome the foreigner in search of the security and the means of livelihood which he cannot find in his country of origin. Public authorities should see to it that the natural right is respected that places a guest under the protection of those who receive him.\nPolitical authorities, for the sake of the common good for which they are responsible, may make the exercise of the right to immigrate subject to various juridical conditions, especially with regard to the immigrants’ duties toward their country of adoption. Immigrants are obliged to respect with gratitude the material and spiritual heritage of the country that receives them, to obey its laws and to assist in carrying civic burdens.\nIn 2017, Pope Francis himself said countries had the right to protect their borders and that countries at risk of terrorism have even more of a right to do so.\n— Ultra Craigé Schmuckatelli 🇺🇸 🤡💊 (@CraigR3521)[February 18, 2025]\nSeeing as the worst terror attack in human history took place on American soil, why does this no longer apply?\nIt seems to me the good Bishops are only vocal about immigration now because billions of dollars in federal tax dollars that went into the coffers of Catholic NGOs are going away. They're more concerned about their bottom line than the safety and dignity of Americans or the moral right of a nation to enforce its immigration laws.\nThis is no different than the Biden DOJ engaging in selective lawfare against his political opponents or how New York dragged Donald Trump into court on campaign finance charges that would have never applied to someone else, let alone turned into felonies.\nIf Weisenburger is so concerned about the salvation of souls when it comes to immigration, where was he during the Biden years, while the supposedly devout-Catholic president advocated for abortion throughout all nine months of pregnancy, and while his DOJ threw Christians of all stripes behind bars for protesting an actual grave evil?\nSupporting abortion is an actual violation of Catholic teaching and canon law and an actual mortal sin.\nYet the USCCB remained largely silent on such violations, and excommunication was rarely, if ever, discussed.\nWhy is Joe Biden above canon law and beyond rebuke, but the men and women tasked with enforcing laws passed by duly elected legislators are now fair game for the harshest punishment the Catholic Church has to offer?\nIt's hard to keep the faith when the current Catholic leadership seems hellbent on such blatant hypocrisy.",

Humidity will increase a bit in the afternoons, but in the evening and overnight we will see temperatures fall into the into the comfortable upper 60s to lower 70s. For those without air conditioning the dewpoints in the lower to mid 60s will combine with the afore mentioned temperatures to produce very comfortable overnights.\nDry weather will also be in the forecast. If you need to do debri removal or home repairs you can count on at least a week of rain free skies. The dry air will also bring mostly sunny conditions accompanied by a breezy wind. In short. The week ahead looks to be a very comfortable string of October days.\nThere has been talk on social media regarding a storm developing and once again hitting Florida.

    "text": "Kaseya’s 2023 Highlights and the Road Ahead Woohoo! What an exciting year 2023 turned out to be. Right from upgrading to VSA 10 to unlocking the efficiencies between the Kaseya and Datto solutions and making the strategic acquisition of Vonahi Security, Kaseya has delivered tons of amazing benefits to its customers in 2023. As we stand on the cusp of 2024, we’d like to take a moment to celebrate the milestones and victories that marked our journey. Join us as we take stock of all that we have achieved and give you a glimpse into what lies ahead. VSA 10 upgrade The VSA 10 upgrade was one of the biggest wins of the year. Even though VSA 9 was powerful without comparison, harnessing its complete potential was no mean feat. The following are the key upgrades that distinguish and differentiate [VSA 10](https://www.kaseya.com/get-started/vsa-demo/) from its predecessor: Cutting-edge automation Powered by cutting-edge automation, VSA 10 saves users hundreds and thousands of hours of manual work while also making managing complex tasks seem like a breeze. This gives users the freedom to focus on more creative tasks while the mundane work is handled automatically. We received reports of higher productivity, more efficiency and better work-life balance by our hard-working technicians. Scripting flexibility Another notable change that makes VSA 10 more intuitive is the swapping of the proprietary scripting language of VSA 9’s Agent Procedures for industry-standard PowerShell, Bash, Batch and VBScript. This upgrade gave users more flexibility and freedom to tailor their scripting processes according to their specific needs and preferences. Access to widely used scripting languages makes it easier to integrate VSA 10 with a wide range of tools and existing networks. Seamless integrations The [Kaseya IT Complete platform](https://www.kaseya.com/) that provides seamless integration with a host of critical IT tools makes VSA even more powerful. This year, we further strengthened the connection between Kaseya and Datto solutions with several crucial integrations. Some of the standout integrations that users love are those with [Datto Networking solutions](https://www.datto.com/products/networking/) and with PSA solutions like [Autotask](https://www.datto.com/products/autotask-psa/), [BMS](https://www.kaseya.com/products/bms/) and Vorex. The integration between VSA and Datto’s networking solutions, which are considered the best in the industry, promises to make discovering, deploying and managing networks effortless and cost-effective for technicians. While SMBs can impress their end users with consistent uptime and exceptional performance, MSPs can deliver high-quality managed networking services in a way that will give them a competitive edge and boost profitability. An advanced policy module for greater efficiency Worth mentioning here is the new advanced policy module in VSA 10 that allows policies to be broken up into containerized objects, making it incredibly easy for managed service providers (MSPs) or IT departments to modify policies to meet the specific needs of their clients and end users. For instance, an MSP can create a policy object that includes all security settings for a client and then create a second policy object for the client’s workstations that includes all network access permissions. Mobile device management We also took note of the demand for [mobile device management (MDM)](https://www.kaseya.com/blog/mobile-device-management-mdm/) capabilities and added that to VSA 10. Whether it’s the organization’s own or employee-owned iPhones, iPads or Android devices, technicians can monitor, manage and secure them easily via the Kaseya console. The addition of MDM fulfills our vision of making VSA 10 a truly unified and remote monitoring and management (RMM) solution. It eliminates the need for users to use different management solutions for each type of device, making the management process seamless. Top-notch security Not just an efficient RMM solution, VSA 10 also doubles up as a formidable security solution. Designed to detect and stop threats like ransomware, and eliminate vulnerabilities through advanced patching capabilities, it provides a secure environment for businesses to operate. VSA 10 also provides real-time monitoring of all systems, ensuring that any potential issues are identified and addressed quickly. Kaseya Help Desk Service The [Kaseya Help Desk Service](https://www.kaseya.com/products/help-desk-services/) is our hottest new service launch of the year. It instantly enables MSPs and IT departments to expand their coverage and deliver best-in-class service delivery without expanding their payroll. Bolstered by 100% in-region staff (Orlando, Florida and Dundalk) and operating round the clock, our help desk service will manage the daily delivery and management of L1 and L2 tickets for customers, ensuring data sovereignty that supports major international compliance standards. This is truly one of the biggest launches in Kaseya’s history, freeing MSPs and IT departments from the clutches of the “have-you-tried-turning-it-off-and-on-again” script, freeing them to drive innovation and optimize services. Vonahi and audIT acquisitions At Kaseya, we relentlessly seek to make IT management easier for our customers. We aim to be the one-stop shop for any solution they need to manage their IT. To this end, we acquired Vonahi Security earlier this year. Vonahi, a pioneer in automated [network penetration testing](https://www.kaseya.com/blog/network-penetration-testing/), brings value to Kaseya’s security suite by expanding its scope and reach to meet a wider set of customer needs. vPenTest, an automated network penetration test platform developed by Vonahi, combines a hacker’s knowledge, methodology, processes and toolsets into a single, deployable SaaS platform. It’s designed in such a way that organizations of all sizes can use it to strengthen their IT environment easily, by performing a penetration test within their environment at any time. The best part — vPenTest provides more value at similar to less costs compared to traditional penetration tests. The company also completed its acquisition and integration of [audIT](https://www.channelfutures.com/mergers-acquisitions/kaseya-wraps-acquisition-of-simplified-sales-tool-audit), a premier and automated SaaS-based sales presentation system, in 2023. The solution allows MSPs to create impressive sales presentations in under 30 minutes that allows them to showcase the value of their work creatively and win the business of more prospects. With audIT, technicians can save a good four to six hours that typically go towards creating a presentation while leaving a better impression on clients. It’s the secret weapon in our MSPs’ arsenal to gain a competitive edge. The IT Complete stack The IT Complete stack has become even more comprehensive and powerful thanks to additional integrations with Datto solutions and acquisitions of Vonahi and audIT. With a continued focus on providing seamless workflows between tools and helping IT professionals and teams do their jobs efficiently, IT Complete continues to be a work in progress, with several more integrations in the pipeline. Closing thoughts While 2023 was a standout year for Kaseya and its customers, get ready to buckle up for an even more electrifying ride in 2024. We will be sharing news that’s set to make waves in the IT industry like never before. No, it’s not another acquisition, partnership or IPO announcement. You’ll have to tune in to [Connect Global 2024](https://www.kaseyaconnect.com/) for the big reveal. It’s an exciting time for Kaseya and its customers. There’s plenty to look back on with pride and even more to look forward to.

    "text": "Patrick Williams injury news gets worse as Chicago Bulls face Knicks | CHGO Bulls PREGAME Podcast\nThe Chicago Bulls face the New York Knicks in a critical matchup, aiming to break a four-game losing streak while dealing with the news that Patrick Williams will be out for at least two weeks due to knee tendinosis. The Bulls have had back-to-back wins against the Knicks earlier in the season, bolstered by Zach LaVine’s standout performances. With the Knicks currently in strong form, having won eight of their last ten games, the absence of Williams raises concerns about the Bulls' rotation and competitiveness. Analysts discuss the implications as both teams gear up for this decisive showdown.\n- The Bulls have lost their last four games.\n- Patrick Williams is expected to be sidelined for a minimum of two weeks.\n- The Knicks are third in the Eastern Conference and entered the matchup on a positive streak.\n- The Bulls are missing key player Zach LaVine, now with Sacramento, who averaged 32 points in their previous wins against the Knicks.\nThe Bulls need to adapt quickly without Williams in the lineup while evaluating how this impacts their playoff hopes. Future games will require adjustments in player roles and strategies to regain momentum.\nBottom LineThe Bulls' immediate challenge lies in overcoming injuries and adapting to a challenging schedule if they hope to regain competitiveness in the Eastern Conference.\nRead more at www.youtube.com\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",

    "text": "Joy follows sad Christmas when dog is found after twelve days in the cold\nBy Emily Tencer\nClick here for updates on this story\nBOUNTIFUL, Utah (\nKSTU) — A Bountiful family spent Christmas without their missing dog, thinking all hope was lost that she’d return.\nAlmost two weeks later, a hiker made an inspiring discovery.\nEmma Hicks’ hike of the Elephant Rock Trail turned into a rescue mission Friday when she came across the dog right near the top.\n“I was like, ‘Oh, just another off-leash dog,” said Hicks. “I didn’t think anything of it, but it kept getting closer and closer and there was no owner anywhere.”\nShe knew something was wrong. The dog was too skinny. Hicks could see her ribs and her paws were bleeding.\nThe German wirehaired pointer had no tags on its collar, but Hicks was able to use her fanny pack to make a leash.\nThe duo made it two miles until the pup couldn’t go on anymore. Hicks had to sling it across her back for the remainder of the way down.\n“We did probably the last mile down on my shoulders,” she said. “You could tell she was just so exhausted.”\nDuring the descent, Hicks called her family for help. Her sister was able to find the owners on social media.\n“Before I was even able to get down the mountain with the dog, he was calling me,” she said. “I was like, ‘Hi, this is Emma.’ He was like, ‘I can’t believe you found my dog.’”\nTurns out the dog named Jane had survived the snowy mountains for twelve days. Her family thought she was dead and killed by coyotes.\nIt was an emotional moment reuniting her with her owners.\n“She definitely had grit and you could tell she wanted to make it back to her family,” said Hicks.\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.
