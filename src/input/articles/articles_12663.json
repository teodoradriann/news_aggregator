Se trata de Teresa Díaz (75), Jorge Flores (51) y Mónica Flores (54), una madre y sus hijos principales, sospechosos de la muerte de la mujer de 32 años que perdió la vida después de someterse a una intervención quirúrgica en una clínica clandestina en la comuna de Las Condes que operada por los imputados. En el veredicto, se determinó que Teresa Díaz y Mónica Flores fueron responsables del delito de homicidio simple, mientras que Jorge Flores fue absuelto de esta acusación. No obstante, los tres fueron considerados autores del delito de ejercer de manera ilegal la profesión de médico cirujano. El trágico suceso tuvo lugar en febrero de 2022, cuando Leslie Vergara se sometió a una cirugía para aumentar sus glúteos en la clínica clandestina. Durante la intervención, la silicona inyectada ingresó a una vena, provocando el fallecimiento de la paciente. Los imputados, quienes supuestamente obtuvieron títulos de Medicina General de la Universidad de Tarapacá en 2015, habrían operado a 48 mujeres desde entonces, generando problemas de salud, especialmente filtraciones en los implantes, en la mayoría de los casos. La sentencia detalla un historial de prácticas médicas ilegales que han afectado a numerosas personas.",
