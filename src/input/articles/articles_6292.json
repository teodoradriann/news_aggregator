    "title": "Jorja Miller's bold move: Why SVNS star is targeting Black Ferns RWC spot",
    "text": "Mia Venner on 'rollercoaster ride' back into Red Roses contention\nJorja Miller isn’t one to shy away from a challenge. Miller is unanimously considered one of the world’s best players on the HSBC SVNS Series with the Black Ferns Sevens, and the 21-year-old isn’t done there with the Women’s\nRugby World Cup now a new target.\nOn Wednesday, it was announced that seven Black Ferns Sevens stars had entered the race for national selection ahead of the showpiece event in England, which begins on August 22 and later ends on September 27 at Twickenham’s Allianz Stadium.\nStacey Waaka and Theresa Setefano both helped the Black Ferns take out the World Cup title on home soil with that famous win over England a few years ago, and the two-time Olympic gold medallists are hoping to help the Black Ferns repeat history in a matter of months.\nAlena Saili,\nDhys Faleafaga and Kelsey Teneti have also already played for the Black Ferns, but the same can’t be said for New Zealand’s sevens vice-captain Risi Pouri-Lane and Miller who are preparing to embark on an exciting new journey.\nIt’s been reported that both Miller and Waaka will be available for the Black Ferns Sevens when the SVNS Series World Championship is held in May, with the duo linking up with the Black Ferns and the other five code-hoppers during World Rugby’s Pacific Four Series.\n“A World Cup in England is second best to a World Cup in New Zealand so that’s really exciting,” Miller explained in a video on the Black Ferns’ Instagram.\n“Just knowing that it was an opportunity, like it’s not going to be easy and man, they’ve got a pretty stacked team already.\n“I can really grow and just learn off the girls. There are some high, high-level professionals in that team with heaps of knowledge that, man, I’d just love to learn off and just be a sponge which I think is really exciting, like a whole new challenge.\nView this post on Instagram\n“Can’t wait for a maul, scrum, the dirty work.”\nMiller has become a core member of the Black Ferns Sevens in recent seasons, with the young talent recognised by World Rugby with a nomination for Sevens Player of the Year in 2024, although that award was later won by try-scoring machine Maddison Levi.\nOn December 12, Miller became the second-youngest rugby player in New Zealand to take out the prestigious Kelvin R Tremain Memorial Player of the Year honour at the ASB Rugby Awards. Legendary All Black\nJonah Lomu was the youngest recipient in its 30-year history.\nWith Team New Zealand claiming Paris Olympics gold last year, with Miller and Waaka both playing a starring role in that run to glory, it goes without saying that these seven athletes jumping codes are world-class in their field.\nBut, as Miller explained, it’s a “whole new challenge” in 15s.\n“Having the ability to add players in the mix that have a proven ability of winning pinnacle events under pressure is invaluable,” Black Ferns Director of Rugby, Allan Bunting, said in a statement.\n“It’s great to have our best female athletes driving internal competition and striving for selection for the World Cup.”\nNews, stats, live rugby and more!\nDownload the new RugbyPass app on the App Store (iOS) and Google Play (Android) now!\nJoin free and tell us what you really think!\nTaniela Tupou's form has tailed off in New South Wales, and how his franchise and national teams need the mighty prop at his best.\nThe former Bath and Toulon coach has taken on the challenge of returning Canadian rugby to its former glories\nA storied rugby institution, the Irish representation from Ulster has fallen away to a trickle in recent years and that is a concern",

    "text": "By Niku Kazori\nClick here for updates on this story\n SIERRA MADRE, California ( KABC ) — With the latest winter storm dropping rain across SoCal, an evacuation warning was issued Tuesday for parts of Sierra Madre, which was hit hard by severe flooding, mudslides and debris flows during the last round of heavy rain.\nThis week’s storm is categorized as a Phase 1 event, which means there’s a 10-20% chance of more significant flooding and debris flows in burn scar areas.\nThe evacuation warning for high-risk areas in Sierra Madre went into effect at 6 a.m. and will remain in place through 6 a.m. Friday.\nStreet parking is prohibited in areas under evacuation warnings or orders.\nLast month’s storm filled every debris basin in the area to capacity. City and county officials say they’ve been working to clear them, but they aren’t empty.\nPolice say once a flow starts, it’s too late to evacuate. That means those who stay behind may be trapped for days until emergency crews can access the area.\nThe following zones in Sierra Madre are under the evacuation warning. Check the Genasys app for more information.\nSMD E002B SMD E003 SMD E004 SMD E005 SMD E006A SMD E006B SMD E007 SMD E008 SMD E009 SMD E010A SMD E010B SMD E010C SMD E011A SMD E011C SMD E012A SMD E012B SMD E012C SMD E012D SMD E019\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

    "text": "[Sports](/sports) [Hockey](/sports/hockey) [New York Islanders](/sports/hockey/islanders)\nSemyon Varlamov doesn't practice, exposing Islanders' potentially fatal flaw\nTheir last loss showcased the persistent flaws in the Islanders’ defensive game. But Thursday’s practice exposed the biggest weakness in the organization.\nGoalie Semyon Varlamov was not on the ice at Northwell Health Ice Center in East Meadow because of maintenance and coach Lane Lambert said he was day to day. It’s unclear whether Varlamov will be able to back up Ilya Sorokin against the Capitals on Friday night at UBS Arena after the Islanders came out of their three-day Christmas break with an abysmal 7-0 loss to the visiting Penguins on Wednesday.\nIf either Sorokin or Varlamov were seriously hurt and missed significant time, it could very well keep the Islanders out of the playoffs because there is not another NHL-ready goalie in the organization. Minor-league journeyman Ken Appleby — who played three NHL games for the Devils in 2017-18 — was recalled from the Islanders’ AHL affiliate in Bridgeport for Thursday’s practice.\n“It’s good for him,” Lambert said. “He sees our shooters, which is different for him than being down there and seeing the same shooters every day. Then he comes in and he gets a little feel for the day after a game where we didn’t play very well.”\nThe 28-year-old Appleby, an undrafted free agent, is 5-4-0 with a 2.86 goals-against average and an .898 save percentage for Bridgeport. Jakub Skarek, 24, a third-round pick in 2018, is 3-13-2 with a 3.51 GAA and .877 save percentage for Bridgeport.\nTristan Lennox, 21, a third-round pick in 2021 and Henrik Tikkanen, 23, a seventh-round pick in 2020, comprise the goalie tandem for the Islanders’ ECHL affiliate in Worcester. Lennox is 5-6-2 with a 2.94 GAA and .909 save percentage while the 6-7 Tikkanen is 6-5-2 with a 3.11 GAA and .896 save percentage.\nSo none of the goalie prospects — granted that term doesn’t really apply to Appleby — are posting consistent numbers.\nThe previous three seasons, the Islanders had the Devils former No. 1 netminder Cory Schneider — now retired and working as a television analyst — as the in-case-of-emergency-break-glass option in Bridgeport.\nThe Islanders have been fortunate because Sorokin and Varlamov — who both have proven to be excellent No. 1 goalies — have been durable. Schneider was called upon to play just one NHL game in his three seasons in the organization.\n“Well, I know one thing,” president/general manager Lou Lamoriello said before training camp opened in September. “When I go to bed at night, I feel pretty good knowing our goaltending.”\nHe was talking about the NHL roster.\nVarlamov’s absence on Thursday shows Lamoriello may have to acquire a goalie with more NHL experience to bolster the organization’s Plan B in net.\nNotes & quotes: Casey Cizikas missed Thursday’s practice because of illness. Lambert said he expects the fourth-line center to be available against the Capitals . . . Defenseman Scott Mayfield (injured reserve/upper body) continued to skate with the team but Lambert said he would not play on Friday. It will be the eighth game Mayfield misses . . . Defenseman Grant Hutton was re-assigned to Bridgeport to create a roster spot for Appleby.",

    "text": "La Semana Santa es una de las fechas más especiales y representativas para todos aquellos que creen en Dios. Se trata de un momento especial que sirve para que muchas personas puedan mejorar su relación con él.\nAsí las cosas, el Viernes Santo sirve para reflexionar y participar de las diversas ceremonias que existen para rendirle tributo a Dios. Además, entre las costumbres más comunes están el realizar ayuno y no comer carnes rojas. Sobre la importancia de esta fecha habló en Caracol Radio el Monseñor Gabriel Ángel Villa , arzobispo de Tunja.\nReflexión y mensaje del Papa Francisco En primer lugar, el monseñor Villa afirmó que Colombia , al ser un país mayoritariamente católico, el mensaje es universal y es que se debe replantear una postura más crítica entre lo que se cree y que lo que se vive a diario. Así las cosas, el amor debe ser el distintivo de todos sin importar la situación en la que nos encontremos.\n“El Papa, cuando iniciamos la Cuaresma, indicó que nuestra tarea es liberarnos de las esclavitudes por el egoísmo, encontrar una salida a la guerra y convertirnos en personas más racionales. De igual manera, esta fecha debe ser la oportunidad de manifestar con un testimonio de vida que hay algo por qué y por quién luchar, y no solamente dejarlo como un tiempo de pasatiempo”, afirmó.\nPor otro lado, toda la actividad de Jesús estuvo acompañada por la oración y debería ser un aspecto a reforzar en la vida cristiana.\nEsfuerzos de Paz Sobre los esfuerzos del Gobierno Nacional por alcanzar la llamada ‘paz total, Monseñor Gabriel Ángel Villa es optimista y más aún porque desde la Iglesia indican que la mayor voluntad es que los diálogos partan de una actitud sincera, y que no se quede en intentos, también que sea respetuoso y se alcance la solución del conflicto y alcancen el perdón.\n“Lo que desea el Papa y la Iglesia es que se pongan los puntos más fuertes sobre la mesa y parta de un corazón que quiera avanzar y que las cosas no se queden en intensiones, que quieran alcanzar el bien común”, reiteró.\nFamilia como núcleo básico de la sociedad Finalmente, sobre la importancia de la familia, Monseñor Gabriel Ángel Villa reiteró que se vive un momento complejo, donde los medios de comunicación y las mismas redes sociales han tomado ventaja en el modelo pedagógico, y a un segundo plano han quedado las enseñanzas de los padres de familia, docentes, entre otras figuras de autoridad.\n“La familia es la célula básica de la sociedad, la pequeña iglesia doméstica, todo parte desde ahí. Nos encontramos en un momento difícil, en el que la tecnología ha tomado fuerza, pero no se debe satanizar”, reiteró.\nEscuche la entrevista completa en Caracol Radio",

    "text": "【大纪元2025年08月07日讯】（大纪元记者蔡上海台湾嘉义报导）嘉义县全力投入灾后重建工作，为协助因灾失业的乡亲并加速地方复原，县府劳工暨青年发展处提供800个临时工作机会。县长翁章梁7日前往义竹乡公所及资源回收站，实地关心临时工的工作情形。\n现场不少临时工都是自发参与灾后重建，70岁的蔡小姐表示，看到自己家乡灾损严重，十分不舍，虽已退休但仍希望尽一份心力。而同为临时工的陈小姐也说，自家同样受到灾损影响，在协助灾民办理补助登记的过程中，不仅能帮助不识字的长辈，也让她回家后能为身边亲友解答问题、提供协助，觉得这份工作特别有意义。\n翁章梁指出，劳动部劳动力发展署云嘉南分署核定嘉义县提供800个临时职缺，其中义竹乡申请113人。他表示，公所在协助重建和申请补助等相关工作时，公务人员及临时工需第一线面对来自灾民的质疑与压力，因此他也特别勉励同仁们应善尽说明责任，并感谢大家在灾后复原工作中的努力与付出。\n劳青处长陈奕翰补充，因近日西南气流挟带强降雨影响，造成部分地区再度淹水及发生土石流情形，县府确定增加90名临时工人力投入救灾及重建。\n陈奕翰强调，灾后临时工不仅为地方提供即时劳动力，也让受灾失业者获得短期就业机会，实为双重助益。县府将持续积极协助推动临时工计划，协助各乡镇尽速恢复正常生活环境。\n天灾临时工招募延长至8月8日止，如有意愿投入灾后重建工作且设籍、居住或原工作于灾区的失业者，请速至各地就业中心（或就业服务站、台）办理求职登记。◇\n责任编辑：陈玟绮",
