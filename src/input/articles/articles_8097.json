    "text": "NEW YORK — The German Consulate at the United Nations was targeted during a night of anti-Israel vandalism across Brooklyn and Manhattan, police said Friday. As the homes of Brooklyn Museum director Anne Pasternak and several board members were targeted by pro-Palestinian protesters along with the Permanent Observer Mission of the State of Palestine to the United Nations, three people splattered paint on the Consulate General of the Federal Republic of Germany at 871 U.N. Plaza. The vandals spray painted the front of the building and plastered posters on the front door, police said. It was not immediately disclosed what was written on the posters. Cops are calling the vandalism “bias criminal mischief.” While the homes of the Brooklyn Museum board members were also splattered with paint, the incident at the German consulate hasn’t been grouped in with any other acts of vandalism from Wednesday, a police source said. Surveillance video captured two women and a man walking near the scene. They fled the area in a dark colored vehicle. No arrests have been made. Vandals hit the homes of the Brooklyn Museum board, who live in both Brooklyn and Manhattan, between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. Wednesday. The Palestinian mission was vandalized around 6:15 a.m. The German consulate was vandalized around 3:30 a.m., cops said. Attempts to reach the German consulate were unsuccessful Thursday. Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters rallied outside the Brooklyn Museum on May 31, with some getting into the building and setting up tents. NYPD cops arrested 34 protesters during the raucous rally. There has been a steady stream of protests in the city and across the nation since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, sparking a ferocious war in Gaza. On Monday, protesters rallied outside the Nova Exhibition , a memorial created to honor the victims of Hamas’ attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis and took hundreds hostage. Some protesters waved a flag with Hamas’ emblem, as well as a sign lauding the massacre. Mayor Eric Adams and relatives of those killed during the Oct. 7 terror attack visited the exhibition Tuesday , calling the previous day’s protest “despicable.” Cops on Thursday released images of the vandals wanted for defacing Pasternak’s building asking anyone with information regarding their identity to step forward. ©2024 New York Daily News.

    "text": "Northern Lights create dazzling sky show over New Hampshire The Northern Lights created quite a sight over parts of New Hampshire and New England on Thursday night. Along Ocean Boulevard in Rye and North Hampton, many drivers pulled over to get out and appreciate the aurora borealis. Smart phone cameras can capture the aurora better than the human eye, which is why you are seeing your social media channels populated with so many images of the night sky in dramatic shades of red, green, and orange. The overhead light show is the second round of northern lights that have been so visible in the Northeast this year. The other one, in May, [also dazzled and inspired people](https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2024-05-10/northern-lights-solar-storm-nh-new-england) to snap photos and share them readily across their social media channels. NASA's Space Weather Prediction Center maintains [an aurora dashboard](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/communities/aurora-dashboard-experimental) that provides information on solar storms and the chances of seeing aurora borealis overhead.

    "text": "Robe-wearing DJ NewJeansNim draws complaints from Singapore Buddhists The South Korean performer has been praised in his homeland for boosting interest in Buddhism, but Southeast Asia has been less welcoming. Singapore – A popular South Korean DJ ‘monk’, known for donning a cleric’s robes and combining electronic dance music with Buddhist mantras, is stirring controversy among the faithful in Singapore who claim he is denigrating the religion. On Sunday, May 19, the Singapore Buddhist Federation called for NewJeansNim’s two performances at a disco club in June to be cancelled. In a Facebook post, it noted that the DJ dons a monk’s robe even though he is not ordained – this is “against [the] Vinaya”, or the code of conduct for Buddhist monks. The federation urged authorities to cancel his performance permits in order to “avoid bringing embarrassment to Buddhists”. Keep readinglist of 4 items [Shaken passengers from deadly turbulence-hit flight arrive in Singapore](/news/2024/5/22/shaken-passengers-from-turbulence-hit-flight-arrive-in-singapore?traffic_source=KeepReading) [One dead as Singapore Airlines flight from London hit by severe turbulence](/news/2024/5/21/one-dead-as-london-to-singapore-flight-hit-by-turbulence?traffic_source=KeepReading) [Lawrence Wong sworn in as Singapore’s first new prime minister in 20 years](/news/2024/5/15/lawrence-wong-sworn-in-as-singapores-first-new-prime-minister-in-20-years?traffic_source=KeepReading) Now, the government has got involved with Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam warning on Facebook that “action will be taken” should NewJeansNim – whose real name is Youn Sung-ho – proceed with his usual act. The comments on the minister’s post were broadly supportive, with many urging him to cancel the DJ’s performances altogether. In accordance with an advisory from the Singapore Police Force, performance venue Club Rich’s owner, Jackie He, told Al Jazeera that the events, which have sold out, will be “non-religious”- and they will ensure NewJeansNim does not wear a monk’s robe, use a religious instrument or play any music that is related to a Buddhist chant. A member of the club’s management added that Youn had agreed to the terms, noting that the Buddhist elements are just one part of his repertoire. There has been no official comment from Youn himself. Kelvin Siau, a lifelong Buddhist, told he Al Jazeera he would prefer that authorities go further. “He should be barred from entering Singapore. This is to show that Singapore is a strict country [on] religious matters,” said the 42-year-old, who said he found NewJeansNim’s act “disrespectful” and “an insult to the image of Buddhism and the monks”. Club Rich is located near one of the largest and most popular Buddhist temples in Singapore. According to a 2020 census, more than a third of Singapore’s population is Buddhist, making it the city-state’s leading religion. Leow Yuan Kai, 36, another lifelong Buddhist, was more forgiving about the show, however. “My friends and I do not think the performance has enough cause for concern,” he said. “It’s a performance in a night club with a very specific demographic as its audience after all.” Riling the faithful It is the second time in recent weeks that Youn, a 47-year-old comedian-turned-musician, has riled Buddhists in Southeast Asia. In early May, a dance club in Kuala Lumpur cancelled his second set “in the interest of social harmony” following complaints by both senior Buddhist clergy, as well as politicians who urged Malaysian authorities to ban him from future events. By contrast, the shaven-headed, homily-dispensing Youn is a rising star in his home country, beloved by Gen Z and Millennial fans. He has also performed in places such as Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. Youn has even been employed by the Jogye Order, South Korea’s largest Buddhist order, to help spread the faith. Its president thanked him for “spreading a much younger Buddhism to the young generation”, according to the Korea Herald. Associate professor Jack Chia of the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) history department, an expert on Buddhism in Southeast Asia, told Al Jazeera that for historical and socioeconomic reasons, there are significant differences between [East Asia](/features/2023/12/28/when-death-metal-becomes-one-of-84000-ways-to-practise-buddhism) and [Southeast Asia](/news/2015/10/13/thailand-bans-film-over-depictions-of-buddhist-monks) when it comes to expectations about the roles and conduct of Buddhist monks. “Buddhists in Malaysia, Singapore and Southeast Asia more broadly would find it offensive for a nonordained person to be dressed and performing in monastic robes in the name of Buddhism,” he said, adding that the performances were also taking place in a club which serves alcohol, whose consumption is forbidden by one of Buddhism’s five precepts. By contrast, with the decline of religion – particularly Buddhism – in South Korea, the Buddhist community there is looking for creative ways to inspire interest in Buddhism among the younger generation. “It is no surprise that [the progressive Jogye Order] supports innovative methods to promote Buddhism and are happy to endorse NewJeansNim’s unconventional Buddhist DJ music,” Chia said. He also pointed to Japanese Buddhists who have performed rock and hip-hop Buddhist music and even opened bars to attract a younger generation. Zen monk Kanho Yakushiji’s music has also been well-received by Buddhist communities worldwide. Racial and religious harmony Like [Malaysia](/news/2018/12/8/malaysia-malays-rally-amid-worries-over-government-weakness), Singapore is a multicultural, multireligious and multilingual society. It is particularly [sensitive](/news/2022/5/14/rapping-for-the-vulnerable-of-singapore) to anything that might disrupt racial and religious harmony. Authorities often invoke the spectre of racial riots from the 1960s, in which dozens were killed. Strict laws give authorities expansive powers to deal with those deemed to have crossed “red lines” on race and religion. The conditions of a public entertainment licence for an establishment state that the entertainment on offer must not be likely to cause offence to any race, religion, ethnicity or nationality, or potentially cause disharmony among different groups. Authorities are quick to act on any potential strife. In 2019, despite agreeing to adhere to strict requirements, Swedish black metal band Watain saw its performance permit withdrawn after an online petition against its concerts. The Ministry of Home Affairs said at the time that Watain had a history of denigrating religions and promoting violence, which had the potential to disrupt the city-state’s social harmony. “Singapore’s approach to religious and racial harmony – like many other things – is to act on complaints, often based on hurt feelings,” noted analyst Chong Ja Ian of NUS’s political science department. “There is a logic that says, if there are hurt feelings, the state must step in to resolve a situation, assure, and make sure nothing happens just in case there may be the chance of escalation.” Chong added: “Such an approach may inadvertently encourage various groups to complain as loudly as they can about how hurt they are in anticipation of a crackdown. Less clear to me is what happens to groups and individuals that do not or cannot complain as loudly or as stridently, or what happens to society’s ability to accommodate difference.”",

    "text": "La Secretaría del Trabajo de Coahuila fue informada este jueves por parte de la empresa Trinity Rail, instalada en la ciudad de Sabinas, de la baja temporal de aproximadamente un 15 por ciento de su plantilla laboral, a los cuales se les está cubriendo el 100 por ciento de sus derechos contemplados en la Ley Federal del Trabajo.\nLa empresa indicó que estas bajas temporales obedecen a un reajuste de contratos y producción con el objetivo de mantener la viabilidad de la empresa en el corto y mediano plazo. Sin embargo, confían que en los próximos meses exista una recuperación y estar nuevamente en condiciones de llamar a laborar a estos colaboradores.\nCabe mencionar que esta Secretaría mantiene comunicación directa con la empresa, sindicato y trabajadores para continuar verificando el total cumplimiento de los derechos laborales de los trabajadores.\nAdemás, en el mes de abril se realizará una Feria de Empleo en la región carbonífera, donde se ofertarán vacantes en empleos formales para aquellas personas que busquen reincorporarse de inmediato al mercado laboral.\nEsta feria forma parte de las acciones permanentes de vinculación laboral que lleva a cabo la Secretaria del Trabajo en todas las regiones del estado, que en el primer trimestre del año vinculó alrededor de 3 mil vacantes.\nEl Gobierno del Estado, en coordinación con las autoridades municipales y la empresa, mantendrá abierta la mesa de diálogo para buscar alternativas viables que permitan la recuperación de la actividad en beneficio de las familias coahuilenses.\n¡NRT México ya tiene aplicación!

    "text": "From San Francisco came the blue jeans and the rainbow flag. From here came this idea of health care as a right, not a privilege. The Bold Italic\n· Follow\nPublished in The Bold Italic\n· 6 min read · Apr 18, 2024\n--\n2\nListen\nShare\nPhoto of San Francisco skyline by Joe Passe. This article is part of I Love San Francisco , a feature series of essays that highlight what makes San Francisco iconic and irreplaceable. It’s also an expanded excerpt from Alec Scott’s book — Oldest San Francisco .\nBy Alec Scott\nI came to San Francisco to visit a college friend in a place on Telegraph Hill that looked out over Alcatraz. A family emergency called her away, and I was left on my own with a powder-blue Volkswagen Bug at my disposal. Its brakes weren’t the best, and I remember some perilous backward rolls and slips, some careens downhill that felt like something out of a show I’d seen as a kid, in reruns, The Streets of San Francisco .\nI began with a visit to the Japanese Tea Garden , the oldest such public garden in the country — in Golden Gate Park. I had dim sum in the continent’s oldest Chinatown . I bought some books by the Beat Generation at City Lights , the nation’s first bookstore specializing in paperbacks, and read them at Caffé Trieste , the first espresso house on the West Coast. I went to Haight-Ashbury to look for traces of the counterculture and found that the free clinic that cared for the flower children was still open.\nAnd as a young, straightlaced kid from small-town Ontario, I ventured to the Castro, where I was inspired by its massive rainbow flag, waving in the breeze to acknowledge that, though I was straightlaced, I wasn’t straight. (I would come out a year later.)\nFrom top left, clockwise: Photo of Japanese Tea Garden by Dennis Jarvis; Chinatown cable car by Neil Howard; City Lights by Digital Archaeology, and of Haight Ashbury by Dale Cruise. When I moved here in 2008, I was worried that the city would have changed from my first visit. Remarkably though, much of old San Francisco remained. I dug into the history of those places I mentioned — since these were not just the oldest things of their kind in the city, but often in the nation.\nI learned about Gilbert Baker , this gay Vietnam vet from Kansas who settled here after the war, and, at gay Supervisor Harvey Milk’s request, helped design and stitch a multi-colored flag for the first Gay Freedom Day — the 1978 event that would morph into Pride. His friend and Milk’s longtime aide, Cleve Jones, once spoke to me about the day another supervisor killed Milk, how he found Milk’s lifeless body in his City Hall office. “We thought it was over, the push for gay rights,” Jones told me while we sat in what was then his regular Café Flore .\nPhoto of the rainbow flag at Pride by David Yu; Of Cleve Jones in 2009 by Paul Schreiber. “But then there was a candlelight vigil that night, and you could see the light from it, all along Market Street — everyone came.”\nIt was moving to me to hear this — of course, it was. And it spoke to me of the spirit of this city, the warmth and fellow feeling that often abounds here.\nEach time I’ve held an event to help launch Oldest San Francisco — the just-released book that resulted from my research — someone has asked me to speak to the reports that have the city in an insoluble set of crises. I tend to answer with some version of this: The problems are serious and interlocking, and government, businesses and individuals living here need to pull together to help work at them.\nPhoto on the left by Thomas Hawk. On the right of San Francisco’s Tenderloin neighborhood by David Hanwell. But my research into the city’s past has given me hope that the city and the people who love it will rise to the challenges laid down for those living here now. Within ten years after the 1906 Quake and fire that destroyed much of the still young city, San Francisco had rebuilt and mustered its energies to host what was a blockbuster World’s Fair, the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exhibit.\nIn the thick of the Depression, residents didn’t just throw up a serviceable bridge to cross the Golden Gate, they built the soaring engineering marvel, what was then the longest suspension bridge in the world. Visitors still come from around the world to see it, to photograph themselves with it.\nTo cope with the significant collateral damage of the so-called Summer of Love, a young medic named Dave Smith exited a fairly mainstream career with an upward trajectory to open a free clinic to help his hippie clients with their various health challenges — this clinic became a model for clinics across the country, with Smith famously declaring, “Health Care is a right, not a privilege.”\nPhotos of Haight Ashbury by Thomas Hawk. And, after the assassination of Milk and mayor George Moscone, capable Dianne Feinstein emerged to take charge, buoyed up by that candlelight vigil, to move the city past the tragedy, towards the future.\nThese stories embody some of what I love about here, my adopted home. San Francisco is an influencer city. From here came the blue jeans and the rainbow flag. From here came this idea of health care as a right, not a privilege — an idea that remains controversial in this country, but still, clinics modeled on this one have helped millions of our fellow citizens.\nIt is a future-oriented city, yes, a city that has drawn dreamers to it from the Gold Rush on. But it is also one with a strong sense of its past. Every day of the year, through the City Guides program, volunteers walk others through the city, speaking gratis of that past. When we moved here in 2008, we went on countless such walks.\nPhoto by Dale Cruise. We met the golden fire hydrant that pumped out water during the post-quake fire, saving much of the city. We walked up through Hayes Valley, bustling with new restaurants and businesses, and the owner of one of the historic victorians there took us into his basement to show us his Player Piano collection. He got them all to play that old chestnut, San Francisco, while he stood happily at the back of the room, conducting them with his hands in the air.\nThe song’s lyric, “Open Your Golden Gate,” has always felt like it was addressed to me, and I’m sure many others who’ve chosen to live here feel the same way. The city’s spirit of openness, of camaraderie, of pulling together in the face of difficulty — I treasure it.\nAlec Scott is an award-winning journalist, with features in The New York Times, Guardian, Smithsonian Magazine, Los Angeles Times and Sunset.\nLearn more about Oldest San Francisco , his latest book with stories of the institutions that helped make San Francisco the place it is today.\nThe Bold Italic is a non-profit media organization that’s brought to you by GrowSF , and we publish first-person perspectives about San Francisco and the Bay Area.

The northern lights could be visible in some areas of the U.S., including parts of Wisconsin, [following two observed coronal mass ejections](https://x.com/NWSSWPC/status/1841524465143841047) Tuesday, including [the massive X7.1 solar flare](https://x.com/NWSSWPC/status/1841524465143841047), according to the Space Weather Prediction Center. The center [issued geomagnetic storm watches](https://www.spaceweather.gov/news/g1-g3-minor-strong-geomagnetic-storm-watches-issued-03-05-october#:~:text=G1-G3%20(Minor-Strong)%20Geomagnetic%20Storm%20Watches%20have%20been%20issued%20for%2003-05) for the rest of the week, forecasting that the northern lights will be present in the night sky. In May, a [powerful geomagnetic storm](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/10/severe-solar-storm-2024/73642315007/) unleashed [spectacular views of the northern lights](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/11/aurora-borealis-photos-northern-lights-seen-us-europe/73652013007/) in areas of the U.S. where auroras are seldom visible, [including here in Milwaukee](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/2024/05/11/northern-lights-seen-in-milwaukee-wisconsin-last-night/73653382007/). As the [sun nears the height of its 11-year cycle](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/01/northern-lights-solar-maximum-auroras/75449249007/) in 2025, people across the world can expect more frequent and brighter northern-light activity due to increased electromagnetic activity. Where can I see the northern lights in Wisconsin? [According to the NOAA](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-viewline-tonight-and-tomorrow-night-experimental#:~:text=Tomorrow%20Night's%20Aurora%20Viewline.%20This%20is%20a%20prediction%20of%20the), the northern lights could be visible in northern Wisconsin and perhaps as far south as southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois Thursday night and into the weekend. The northern lights are expected to be visible in multiple northern U.S. states Thursday night, Friday night and Saturday night, according to the Space Weather Prediction Center. Sightings are forecasted along the U.S.-Canada border, but also as far south as Oregon to Pennsylvania, according to the center. The best time to view the auroras will be Friday from around midnight into the early hours of Saturday. Outside variables, such as weather and the precise trajectory of the solar eruption, which can change during its 93-million-mile journey to Earth, could affect the reliability of the forecast. To monitor the aurora forecast, you can use the [NOAA aurora forecast tool](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-30-minute-forecast), which has a 30-minute forecast window. There's also a tool on the Milwaukee Astronomical Society website at [milwaukeeastro.org](https://milwaukeeastro.org/obsInfo/solarActivity.asp#loaded). On the tool, you'll see the northern lights prediction for 35 minutes ahead. You'll have good odds of seeing the northern lights if the color over Wisconsin is yellow, orange or even red. What causes the northern lights? Also known as aurora borealis, the northern lights are [a natural light display in Earth's sky](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/10/northern-lights-aurora-when-time/73638964007/) that is famously best seen in high-latitude regions of the northern and southern hemispheres. The phenomenon is caused when electrically charged particles from space enter Earth's atmosphere and collide with [molecules and gasses like oxygen and nitrogen](https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/05/18/northern-lights-colors-explained/73731506007/), causing the atmospheric particles to gain energy. To return to their normal state, the particles release that energy in the form of light, according to the [University of Alaska at Fairbanks, Geophysical Institute](https://www.gi.alaska.edu/monitors/aurora-forecast) website, which tracks the phenomenon. As auroras form, Earth's magnetic field redirects the particles toward the poles through a process that produces a stunning display of rays, spirals and flickers that have fascinated humans for millennia. Whether hues of green, red, blue and pink dance about in the sky is due to the altitude in which the collisions occur, as well as the composition and density of the atmosphere at the time. When northern lights are active, the best time to see them is between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. Best places in Wisconsin to see the northern lights Here's a list of places in Wisconsin that could offer some of the best views of the night sky: [Newport State Park](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/newport), Ellison Bay [Driftless Region, Wisconsin](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2022/06/28/driftless-region-wisconsin-vernon-county-wants-become-international-dark-sky-park-kickapoo-valley/7487767001/) [Harrington Beach State Park](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/harringtonbeach), Belgium [Kettle Moraine State Forest](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/kms), Eagle [Kohler-Andrae State Park](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/kohlerandrae), Sheboygan [Parnell Tower](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/kmn/recreation/hiking), Plymouth Journal Sentinel reporter Alex Groth contributed to this report.",

    "text": "MADRID, 2 (EUROPA PRESS) El presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, ha aplaudido que más de un millón de estudiantes en prácticas de Formación Profesional y universitarios hayan empezado a cotizar a la Seguridad Social desde este lunes 1 de enero.\n\"Las prácticas no remuneradas ya cotizan. Saldamos una deuda de años con los becarios, por justicia social. 2024 será el año de seguir ampliando derechos y de mejorar la vida de los jóvenes en España\", ha señalado este martes el presidente del Gobierno en una publicación en la red social X.\nPara la ministra de Educación, Formación Profesional y Deportes, Pilar Alegría, esta es una medida que \"va a mejorar la vida de miles de jóvenes\" en España. \"Los estudiantes de Formación Profesional ya cotizan también por sus prácticas en empresas. Una medida que va a mejorar la vida de miles de jóvenes en nuestro país\", ha dicho.\nEn la misma línea, la vicepresidenta Segunda del Gobierno y ministra de Trabajo y Economía Social, Yolanda Díaz, ha subrayado que empieza en año tal y como lo acabaron, \"ampliando derechos\".\n\"Más de un millón de becarios ya están cotizando. Esto supone un gran avance en la protección de los más jóvenes. Pero vamos a más. Este 2024 aprobaremos el Estatuto del Becario\", ha apuntado la vicepresidenta Segunda del Ejecutivo.\nLa cotización de los estudiantes en prácticas ha entrado en vigor este 1 de enero a pesar de que las comunidades autónomas gobernadas por el Partido Popular pidieron una moratoria o que se anulara.\nEn concreto, en 2024 un total de 458.959 estudiantes de Formación Profesional en prácticas han empezado a cotizar a la Seguridad Social, ya que esta medida, diseñada por el Ministerio de Inclusión, Seguridad Social y Migraciones, ha entrado en vigor el 1 de enero. Por tanto, esta medida afecta ya a más de 500.000 estudiantes universitarios, según los datos publicados por Yolanda Díaz.\nEn cuanto al coste, Seguridad Social bonificará el 95% de las cotizaciones y el Ministerio de Educación, Formación Profesional y Deportes financiará el 5% restante en 2024.\nLa cotización a la Seguridad Social de los estudiantes de Formación Profesional en prácticas costará a las comunidades autónomas en torno a 18 euros al año por alumno a partir de 2025, según datos facilitados por el Ministerio de Educación, Formación Profesional y Deportes, recogidos por Europa Press.\nEl Ministerio de Inclusión, Seguridad Social y Migraciones asegura que, para abordar la cuestión de la cotización de los estudiantes en prácticas, han celebrado \"cerca de dos centenares de reuniones\" entre representantes de la Tesorería General y de las administraciones autonómicas.\nLa medida se enmarca dentro del proceso de \"modernización y mejora\" de la calidad de la Formación Profesional impulsado por el Gobierno de España hace cinco años, que ha logrado aumentar el alumnado en más de un 35% durante este periodo hasta superar el millón de estudiantes.\nMás información Pedro Sánchez Seguridad Social",
