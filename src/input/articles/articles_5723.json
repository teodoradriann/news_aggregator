    "text": "Culiacán, Sin. A 9 de Abril.- El robo de vehículos que en el año 2024 creció en Sinaloa en un seis por ciento, con tres mil 985 denuncias, lo convirtió en el quinto delito de mayor aumento anual, después de los homicidios dolosos, la privación ilegal de la libertad, la extorsión y los robos a comercios.\nDe acuerdo con el análisis Ciudadano Evaluado, realizado por el área de Investigación de la Coordinación General del Consejo de Seguridad Pública las ciudades que concentraron el 75 por ciento de los robos de las unidades motrices el año pasado fueron Culiacán y Mazatlán.\nEn base a los resultados, de los tres mil 985 vehículos robados, solo 499 se lograron recuperar, lo que implica que uno de cada víctima de este delito logró su recuperación, por lo que la tasa de impunidad es muy alta.\nLee también Ataque a minicasino clandestino deja 4 personas lesionadas en Culiacán; reportan operativo en Mocorito\nLa información divulgada, hace referencia al tamaño del impacto que si los casi cuatro mil unidades motrices robadas el año pasado fueran colocados uno tras otro, sobre la principal avenida de Culiacán que es la Álvaro Obregón, daría una vuelta completa, desde el templo de la Lomita hasta donde finaliza la zona urbana.\nEn el estudio, la Coordinación General del Consejo Estatal de Seguridad Pública, se menciona que durante los dos primeros cuatrimestres del 2024, la tasa de vehículos robados diario era de 11 unidades, cifra que creció de septiembre a diciembre, con un promedio de 18 despojos.\nLos análisis sobre este delito, arrojaron que de cada diez denunciantes, seis refieren que fueron víctimas de la violencia, esto sugiere que no solo aumentó el número de robos de vehículos, sino que se elevó la agresividad de los delincuentes.\nLee también Aseguran armas, explosivos, equipo táctico y tres vehículos en Cósala, Sinaloa; uno de los autos simulaba ser naval\nSegún las investigaciones las unidades motrices con mayor índice de robo son las camionetas Pick Up, de cinco mascas y modelos distintos, con un 21 por ciento, seguido de los vehículos tipo SUV, con un veinte por ciento y luego los sedanes con un 15%.\nÚnete a nuestro canal ¡EL UNIVERSAL ya está en Whatsapp!, desde tu dispositivo móvil entérate de las noticias más relevantes del día, artículos de opinión, entretenimiento, tendencias y más.\nnro/cr",

    "title": "World Network Unveils Major Updates at San Francisco Event",
    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 17, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- World Network, formerly known as Worldcoin, today made a series of groundbreaking announcements during its exclusive global event in San Francisco, hosted by co-founders Sam Altman and Alex Blania . As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve at a rapid pace, World is introducing new infrastructure to empower individuals and create systems that benefit everyone.\nHere are the key updates from the event:\n1. Next-Generation Orb: Expanding the Reach of Proof of Human Verifications\nWorld unveiled the latest Orb , a revolutionary new device that enhances the efficiency and scalability of World ID verifications. Powered by the latest NVIDIA Jetson chipset , the new Orb offers nearly five times the AI performance compared to its predecessor. Its updated design reduces complexity with 30% fewer parts and includes a removable external SD card for full auditability.\nThe new Orb enables the creation of more flexible verification models, including flagship locations, on-demand Orbs, and self-serve kiosks—accelerating the deployment of proof of human verifications across the globe.\n2. World ID 3.0: Credentials and Enhanced Privacy Features\nThe launch of World ID 3.0 introduces new features like World ID Credentials , allowing users to store and use information from their NFC-enabled passports on their devices. This enables World ID holders to verify their age, nationality, or passport ownership without revealing their full identity.\nAdditionally, World ID 3.0 brings stronger privacy protections with AMPC (Advanced Multiparty Computation) and World ID Deep Face , a new tool designed to combat online fraud and enhance security in digital interactions.\n3. World App 3.0: The Super App for Humans\nWorld announced the release of World App 3.0 , a redesigned platform built to scale with the expanding World Network. It now supports Mini Apps , allowing third-party apps to integrate directly with World ID , Wallet , and Contacts , all while maintaining user anonymity.\nThe updated World App also includes enhanced wallet features like Vault and World Pay (where available), and it supports World ID Credentials, offering greater utility and security for users.\n4. World Chain Mainnet Launch\nThe highly anticipated World Chain mainnet is officially live. With the migration of over 15 million World ID holders and World App users to the network, World Chain is the first blockchain designed specifically to prioritize human activity and transactions.\nWorld Chain is supported by leading blockchain services, including Optimism , Alchemy , Uniswap , Safe , Dune , and Etherscan , ensuring a robust and scalable infrastructure for users worldwide.\n5. Worldcoin Becomes World Network\nAs the scope and scale of the project continue to expand, Worldcoin has officially rebranded as World Network . The name change reflects the project's broader mission to accelerate progress for all humanity. World Network now stands on three key pillars: World Chain , World ID , and Worldcoin —a network of verified humans designed to ensure an optimistic future where humans remain at the center of AI development.\nAbout World Network\nInitially developed by Sam Altman, Alex Blania and Max Novendstern, World Network is intended to be the world’s largest, most inclusive identity and financial public utility accessible by everyone: an open network supported by a global community of developers, individuals, economists, and technologists. Stewarded by the World Foundation, the project aims to expand global economic participation and accessibility.\nAbout Tools For Humanity\nTools for Humanity (TFH) is a global technology company established to accelerate the transition towards a more just economic system. It led the initial development of World Network and operates the World App. It is governed entirely independently of the World Foundation. Over time, TFH will continue to develop important tools supporting World Network and beyond. Tools for Humanity Corporation is a Delaware (U.S.) corporation headquartered in San Francisco, California.

    "text": "The Outlook: Is that snow in the forecast?\nHappy new year! With a new year comes a new weather pattern here in Utah. This is certainly welcome news. As the author of a column titled The Outlook, it is admittedly nice to have something to actually look out for.\nThe pattern is going to start to shift by Thursday of this week. The previous pattern was one in which storms were dropping down well off the California coast, stalling for several days, then slowly ejecting inland through the desert southwest in a much warmer, weakened state.\nThis has caused our snowpack in Park City (Thaynes Canyon) to fall to just 59% of median as of Jan. 1.\nNot only was this a sub-optimal pattern for snowfall in Utah, but it was also a poor pattern for snow anywhere in the western United States. As such, snowpacks across western North America have suffered.\nOver the next week, the storm track is going to gradually shift farther north. The first storm will still track to our south, but should be close enough for snow showers to reach the Wasatch mountains on Thursday. Accumulations should remain light, but we cannot rule out a few inches of high-elevation snowfall by Friday morning.\nA subsequent, stronger storm is going to track into the Great Basin of Nevada by this weekend. That will bring additional periods of snow showers to northern Utah mountains, including Park City, on Saturday and Sunday.\nThe other element of this new winter weather pattern will be cold air. Because our storms are coming more directly from the northwest, they will be able to pull in colder air into the region before it is moderated by the subtropics.\nTemperatures are going to drop through this weekend. We aren’t expecting anything overly frigid, but it’s going to feel like Summit County in mid-winter — which is more than we can say of much of the past few weeks.\nFrom a ski and snowboard perspective, each day will have the potential for a bit of fresh snow Thursday through the weekend. Right now, the highest likelihood for a true powder day is Sunday.\nThe good news is that this pattern of cold and active weather is likely to continue into next week. This is well-timed for ski conditions to improve just in time for the Sundance Film Festival. This is when Park City locals practice their other favorite pastime — watching festival goers struggle to navigate through snow.\nLet us hope that this favorable start to 2024 is a harbinger of good things to come for the rest of our winter season!\nFor up-to-date forecasts, you can subscribe to Evan’s Utah Daily Snow forecast on OpenSnow.com and the OpenSnow app.\nWay We Were: Overlapping lines and drawn pistols\nOn Feb. 20, 1878, President Rutherford B. Hayes sent the name of New Yorker Michael Shaughnessy to the Senate for confirmation as the 11th U.S. marshal for Utah. His nomination was ratified on March 12. Shaughnessy, wife Eudora, daughters Eudora and Mary, and son Philip arrived March 21 in Salt Lake City, where he took office.\nSee more\nSupport Local Journalism\nSupport Local Journalism\nReaders around Park City and Summit County make the Park Record's work possible.

    "title": "Adam Driver’s Next Italian Role Should Be Luigi",
    "text": "Mamma mia. Did you know Adam Driver is named that because all of us movie nerds are absolutely driving him up a wall? It’s true, and also it’s clever wordplay. The lean, mean, very-good-at-acting machine thinks we’ve been making too much of a fuss over him playing back-to-back Italian guys with broad pizza-box accents, first in 2021’s House of Gucci and then in 2023’s Ferrari . “Who gives a shit that it was two Italians back to back?” he said on the inexplicably popular Smartless podcast. “Like, it’s two!”\nWell, fine. If he really thinks two paisans don’t a pattern make, he shouldn’t just throw the bambino out with the bathwater. He must simply follow this up by playing another famous Italian capitano of industry in another title-role collaboration with a seasoned director .\nLuigi.\nBut … but .. But … you sputter like a like a pathetic Maserati engine trying to keep up with a sexy Ferrari during the 1957 Mille Miglia. But what ? But Luigi isn’t a real person, whereas Maurizio Gucci and Enzo Ferrari are? Idiota! That’s exactly why Luigi would be the perfect character to close out Driver’s Italian trilogy. Being one of the world’s most famous video-game characters and simultaneously one of the world’s most famous sidekicks makes Luigi a fascinating role for Driver to tackle, larger than life and second fiddle all at once. Unbound by the need to imitate someone real, he can make it entirely his own and take big creative swings.\nLuigi occupies a fascinating middle ground between Driver’s two previous Italian roles. He is meek, like Gucci, but really, really into racing small bespoke cars, like Ferrari. In fact, while watching the third act of Ferrari, all I could think was how it reminded me of a Mario Kart level ( Delfino Square , maybe) right down to the inclusion of a mid-race moment with a banana peel. Whereas those other roles were high-status bosses, in a Luigi movie we’d get to see Driver as a plumber, a working man, like his stunning turn as a bus driver in Paterson. Maybe we’d witness him rise to the top of the Mushroom Kingdom’s waste-management industry or become a superstar in the princess-saving business. It would be interesting to do an entire Luigi movie in which Mario is only implied; a brotherly fallout arc would also be fascinating.\nEarlier in 2023, Chris Pratt got flak for totally WASP-washing Mario in the animated Super Mario Bros. Movie , foregoing the character’s charming little accent. Charlie Day’s Luigi followed suit. But audiences had only to wait until the release of Ferrari to hear Driver, Penélope Cruz, and Patrick Dempsey all tackle Mario-ese fake Italian accents with aplomb, giving their performances far more color than Pratt gave to a literal cartoon. Driver has proven he could nail the role in a way that would please longtime Luigi heads. Plus, he’s tall, he wears overalls well , and there is photographic proof of him being able to jump really high .\nFinally, there is the question of who will direct Driver as Luigi. What we’d need for Untitled Adam Driver Luigi Film is a third octogenarian director after Ridley Scott and Michael Mann. Neither Mann nor Scott is Italian, so I’m going to rule out Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese. They’ve both worked with Driver, but they’re also both too genuinely invested in the topic of Italian masculinity to deliver a Gucci -level product.\nSo I’m going to throw a name in the ring: David Cronenberg . Think of what he would do with all of those pipes and sewers Luigi hops around in. Think of what a Cronenbergian Piranha Plant would look like. Better yet, picture his take on Luigi’s Mansion. Anyway, this is some food for thought. Not just an excuse to Photoshop a Luigi hat and mustache on a random picture of Adam Driver or anything.\nRelated Adam Driver on Playing Two Italians: ‘Like, It’s Two!’",

    "text": "1 of 2 missing children found dead after mother ‘brutally’ slain; suspect arrested LORANGER, La. ( [WVUE](https://www.fox8live.com/2024/06/13/2-young-girls-missing-after-mother-found-dead-loranger-sheriff-says/)/Gray News) - Authorities in Louisiana say one of two missing children has been found dead while the other was found alive and well. The Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Office reported the recovery of 3-year-old Erin Brunett’s body Thursday afternoon. Her 6-year-old sister, Jalie Brunett, was found alive and well. The suspect, Daniel Callihan, was arrested in Jackson, Mississippi. Police found the 6-year-old alive in Mississippi, with Callihan, according to authorities. Erin’s body was a few yards from where her sister was found alive. She was taken to the hospital for treatment of minor injuries. Her grandparents are on their way to Jackson to be with her. “You don’t want to see that as a police chief; you don’t want to see that as a father,” said Chief Joseph Wade from the Jackson Police Department. “A coward took this child from her family.” The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and Jackson Police Department are also involved in the investigation. The Louisiana State Police issued an Amber Alert for the two children after finding their mother dead early Thursday morning. According to the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Office, 35-year-old Callie Brunett was missing for over 24 hours before being found found “brutally” slain in her home on North Cooper Road. Her death is being investigated as a homicide. Her two small children, 6-year-old Jalie and 3-year-old Erin were “unaccounted for,” Sheriff Daniel Edwards said. Edwards said Brunett was reported missing Tuesday and because her car was not at her house, her family did not believe she was home. Thursday morning, her father made entry into her home and discovered her body and her children missing. The manner of Brunett’s death was not disclosed, but Edwards said there was “blood everywhere.” Copyright 2024 WVUE via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Asian American & American Zen",
    "text": "In 1972, just after my mother immigrated from Korea to California, she attended a summer camp that gathered young people of different races and religions to build mutual understanding. A smiling sansei (third generation Japanese American) counselor approached her and said, “Welcome, sister.”\nMy mother stared. She was born just after the end of the Korean War—ten years after Korea gained its independence from Japan. Her parents had grown up during the brutal colonization era, and her grandparents had donated to Korean independence fighters who wore rags as they fought one of the most powerful empires on earth.\nMy mother snapped at this Japanese man: “I’m not your sister.”\nFast-forward to 2015. Brooklyn, where I’d arrived from California five years earlier, was roiling with protests against police brutality. I needed something to help me with the rage I felt toward the police, the courts, white supremacy—with America itself.\nI walked into Brooklyn Zen Center hoping meditation would help calm my burning mind. It did. Yet after meditation came chanting, some of which was in Japanese. Even stranger, most of the people in the room were white. I’d come to escape the colonial histories that shaped me, and now I was in a space filled with them.\nI thought: I’m never coming back.\nThose two moments, forty years apart, were both shaped by major movements of the sixties and seventies. And though both movements began in the San Francisco Bay Area, they’re rarely spoken of together. The first was the formation of Asian America as a political identity, and the second was the proliferation of temples in the Shunryu Suzuki Zen lineage.\n“I wish for an American Zen Buddhism that, like Asian America, builds solidarity and community across differences.”\nIn 1968, just a few years before my mother attended that camp, students at San Francisco State University and UC Berkeley went on strike. They formed a Third World Liberation Front that demanded Ethnic Studies and more faculty of color. Some of the students were tired of being “Orientals” and adapted a new term: “Asian.” The next decade saw an explosion of activity on campuses and cities: free health clinics, revolutionary study groups, art exhibitions, after-school programs, labor organizing, feminist publications, and a thousand other projects that made up the Asian American Movement.\nIt was this movement that brought my parents together—two idealists at UC Berkeley in the 1970s. It was this movement that shaped their twenties, as they organized in factories and helped free the wrongfully incarcerated Chol Soo Lee. It was this movement that created or inspired most of the institutions where I later held my first jobs: Museum of Chinese in America, Asian American Writers’ Workshop, and Kundiman. It was this movement that defined “Asian” not as a census category or monoculture, but as a coalition, a strategy, a political stance.\nAt the same time those students went on strike, new Zen temples began sprouting under the guidance of Shunryu Suzuki. He came to America in 1959 at the invitation of Sokoji, a Soto Zen Temple in San Francisco’s Japantown. A group of mostly white, counterculture, young people began seeking out Suzuki’s teachings. They’d read D. T. Suzuki and Alan Watts; they wanted alternatives to the social values and worldviews they were raised with.\nThose students began a sitting group, then began to ask for more intensive monastic training. Suzuki turned his attention toward the new San Francisco Zen Center they founded in 1962, which quickly expanded into two residential centers, Tassajara and Green Gulch, then acquired a building down the street from Sokoji. Teachers who trained at Suzuki’s three centers went on to found temples around the country. There are now more than sixty “Branching Streams” affiliates offering the same practices that Suzuki taught his students, including Brooklyn Zen Center where I first sat.\nIt’s striking that the new Asian America and the new American Zen flowered in the same city, driven by the same countercultures, yet barely interacted. Early Asian American politics were largely influenced by leftist politics. Young organizers saw the material struggles of their communities: aging seniors losing their homes, garment workers facing exploitation, Asian neighborhoods with little access to healthcare or fresh produce. And it seemed as if a global leftist wave, from China and Vietnam to Cuba and Ghana, was remaking the world for the better. Marx famously warned that religion was the “opiate of the masses,” and for many of those organizers, politics was irreconcilable with faith, activism a world apart from contemplation.\nMeanwhile, the early San Francisco Zen Center students were studying Japanese culture but not necessarily Japanese America. They studied Buddhist sutras but not the recent history of internment, Eihei Dogen and Hakuin Ekaku but not Fred Korematsu or Yuri Kochiyama. One way to see the divide between Sokoji and San Francisco Zen Center is a failure to organize across difference: to bring issei and nissei elders together with baby-boomer hippies and the Beat Generation, to create a multiracial sangha where all of those lived experiences were seen and valued. Instead, there was the two temples split.\nNow we have a chance to braid these histories back together. Rev. Dana Takagi suggested in a recent lecture, marking one hundred years of Soto Zen in America, that we might see the Asian American Movement as “studying the self,” Eihei Dogen’s definition of the path of awakening. By understanding our histories and organizing in response, we turn toward liberation through and from our identities.\nThe scholar and poet Russell Leong, in a tribute to the poet Janice Mirikitani, chides those early convert Zen students: “Sure, a typical Zen koan and a tap on a bald pate could bring enlightenment, but a simple meal for a homeless person in San Francisco’s Tenderloin could immediately fill the belly and bring peace of mind.” Perhaps the Asian American Movement was taking a direct path to practice, embodying compassionate action.\nThe merging of dharma and action is, after all, what drew me to Brooklyn Zen Center. My teacher, once an anarchist and part of the Zapatista movement, brings that background to Brooklyn Zen Center when he speaks of collective liberation, when we host teach-ins on prison abolition or hold “undoing patriarchy” workshops.\nI can no longer understand dharma separate from social engagement, nor do I want activism separate from compassion and wisdom.\nI must hold these diverse expressions without discarding any: Sokoji’s Japanese American roots alongside the converts who founded my temple; the challenges of sitting in a majority-white Zen space alongside the beauty of building a multiracial community; ancient sutras as well as contemporary studies of patriarchy and colonialism.\nMy mother encountered Asian American on that day in 1972. Her impulse was to write off the Japanese American counselor, but instead she taught him about Japan’s colonization of Korea and learned from him about the internment camps. She went on to embrace the coalitions of the Asian American Movement and organize across race, class, and age.\nI encountered American Soto Zen that day in 2015. My impulse was to run, yet I found myself returning and returning, tracing the messy threads of my history as I studied the self. Now my life’s work is to include all these complexities, both as a Zen priest in training and as the administrative director of Brooklyn Zen Center.\nI wish for an American Zen Buddhism that, like Asian America, builds solidarity and community across differences. I wish for Asian American organizing, scholarship, and art to hold the cosmologies and belief systems of our ancestors, many of whom were shaped by Buddhism. I believe it’s possible because these two traditions—American Zen and the Asian American Movement—have each pointed me in the same direction: to form vibrant, engaged, and whole communities, and through those communities, to work for the liberation of all.\nThis article was published in the June 2024 issue of\nBodhi Leaves: The Asian American Buddhist Monthly.",
