    "text": "به گزارش بازار، مختار احمدی روز چهارشنبه در آیین افتتاح دوره تخصصی آموزش طبقهبندی مشاغل کارخانجات و داوطلبان آزاد استان مرکزی در اراک، افزود: اجرای این طرح نقش مهمی در حفظ نیروی کار دارد و نیاز است سایر کارگاههای بالای ۵۰ نفر استان که شمار آنها به ۸۰۰ کارگاه میرسد، این مهم را اجرا کنند.\nوی بیان کرد: اجرای طرح طبقهبندی مشاغل در کارگاههای مشمول این طرح زمینهساز ارتقای بهرهوری و پایداری اشتغال در استان مرکزی است.\nمدیرکل تعاون، کار و رفاه اجتماعی استان مرکزی ادامه داد: ضریب پوشش بیمهای این استان ۷۶ درصد است و طبق آمار رسمی، حدود ۴۵ درصد اشتغال در بخش صنعت متمرکز شده که لزوم توجه به روابط کار و طبقهبندی مشاغل را دوچندان میکند.\nاحمدی، به کمبود نیروی کار در برخی شهرستانها اشاره کرد و گفت: کارفرمایانی که طرح طبقهبندی مشاغل را اجرا نکردهاند، صرفا حداقل مزد شورایعالی کار را پرداخت میکنند و این موضوع باعث کاهش تمایل به اشتغال شده است.\nوی اظهار کرد: چنانچه کارگاهی خواستار بازنگری طرحهای در حال اجرا باشد این مسئله در قانون پیشبینی شده و ادارهکل تعاون، کار و رفاه اجتماعی استان مرکزی با اولویت در راستای صیانت از نیروی کار، با کارفرما و شرکای اجتماعی نهایت همکاری را دارد.\nمدیرکل تعاون، کار و رفاه اجتماعی استان مرکزی افزود: توسعه آموزشها در حوزه روابط کار، به ویژه برای اعضای مراجع حل اختلاف امری ضروری است، نباید آموزش تنها به مدیران منابع انسانی محدود شود؛ بلکه اعضای مراجع نیز باید با مفاهیم پایهای قانون کار و تامین اجتماعی آشنا باشند.",
