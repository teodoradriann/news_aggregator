    "title": "Louisville police major lodged the mishandled complaint leading to chief's suspension, attorney says",
    "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Louisville's police chief was suspended this week because she mishandled a police major's sexual harassment complaint, the major's attorney said Thursday.\nLouisville Mayor Craig Greenberg made the surprise announcement Wednesday evening that Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel would be placed on administrative leave for mishandling a sexual harassment complaint involving Louisville police officers. Greenberg did not elaborate on the nature of the allegation or who was involved.\nThe sexual harassment complaint was brought by Maj. Shannon Lauder against another major, a man. Lauder reported it to Gwinn-Villaroel during a May meeting of command staff, and later that same meeting, the man was promoted to lieutenant colonel, attorney Jared Smith said.\nAt the meeting, Gwinn-Villaroel had asked if there were any concerns about working with other members of the command staff, Smith said in an email statement.\n''I will not have a major that cannot get along and support another major because you all had an issue,\" Smith said Gwinn-Villaroel told the command staff at the meeting. ''And if you can't do that, turn in your stuff to me today.''\nLauder had joined remotely due to an illness and recorded the meeting, Smith said. After the chief called on her, Lauder identified a male major and said he ''sexually harassed me and attacked me. I cannot work with him,\" according to Smith.\nShortly after, the chief announced the promotion of that male major to lieutenant colonel, Smith said.\n''The chief's response to Maj. Lauder's allegation paints an unsettling picture of a department lacking strong leadership and failing to prioritize the well-being of its officers,'' Smith said.\nLouisville police referred questions about Lauder's allegations to the mayor's office Thursday. A mayor's spokesperson said he could not comment due to an ongoing internal investigation.\nGreenberg said Wednesday he was seriously concerned about the chief's handling of the allegation, particularly given the U.S. Justice Department's investigation that wrapped up last year. The DOJ said it ''identified deficiencies'' in the Louisville department's response to allegations of sexual misconduct or domestic violence among officers.\n''I will not tolerate sexual misconduct in Louisville Metro Government, including in LMPD,'' Greenberg said Wednesday.\nSmith said Lauder had not previously reported the alleged harassment, though she was ''exploring ways to report the complaint in a confidential way.'' But Lauder felt compelled to complain in front of her colleagues ''due to the way she was put on the spot by the chief,'' Smith said.\nGwinn-Villaroel was named chief less than a year ago, becoming the first Black woman to lead the department in a full-time role.\nShe is the department's third full-time chief since Breonna Taylor was shot to death by officers during a botched raid in 2020. The department has also had three interim chiefs during that time, including a stint by Gwinn-Villaroel.",

    "text": "Terms of Service DMCA Advertise with us Affiliates Media Inquiries About Featured Former President Donald Trump has urged all states to mobilize their National Guard units to help Texas defend its border amid the Lone Star State’s fight with the Biden administration over razor wire barriers. Read Trump’s statement posted to Truth Social on Thursday below: When I was President, we had the most secure Border in History. Joe Biden has surrendered our Border, and is aiding and abetting a massive Invasion of millions of Illegal Migrants into the United States. Instead of fighting to protect our Country from this onslaught, Biden is, unbelievably, fighting to tie the hands of Governor Abbott and the State of Texas, so that the Invasion continues unchecked. In the face of this National Security, Public Safety, and Public Health Catastrophe, Texas has rightly invoked the Invasion Clause of the Constitution, and must be given full support to repel the Invasion.… We encourage all willing States to deploy their guards to Texas to prevent the entry of Illegals, and to remove them back across the Border. All Americans should support the commonsense measures by Texas authorities to protect the Safety, Security, and Sovereignty of Texas, and of the American people. When I am President, on Day One, instead of fighting Texas, I will work hand in hand with Governor Abbott and other Border States to Stop the Invasion, Seal the Border, and Rapidly Begin the Largest Domestic Deportation Operation in History. Those Biden has let in should not get comfortable because they will be going home. The former president’s call comes as the [governors of 25 GOP-led states](https://www.infowars.com/posts/over-10-gop-governors-back-texas-in-border-fight-with-feds/) pledged to support Gov. Greg Abbott’s efforts asserting constitutional authority over the right to erect razor wire boundaries in Eagle Pass.

Fine.New home - I set up the hub - it works with google assistant. It connects to the internet. I can change it's name. I can use it via the touch screen. But the video no longer works. If I check it in the Google Home App (up to date), iDeciesAll instructions (including factory reset) say - go into the Google Home App, go to Settings, and remove device.Here's the issue:Google Home -> Devices (Unassigned) -> Display -> \"View Nest Cam\" does not load anything. \"Turn On\" and it's a loading indicator. If I select the GEAR icon - \"Internal error encountered.\" (Retry - which does nothing). Reboot - will reboot the device. But nothing changes.I can't remove the device. I can't reset the device. Is there a step I'm missing?\nETA:\nI went to support and there it showed me how to do a factory reset - so it reset!But the old device was still listed in Home.Oddly enough, despite saying it was \"resetting everything\" it saved… everything. But it's working now.That took too much effort to resolve, but hopefully anyone else hitting this issue can find this helpful!\nnever-displayed\nFollow Us\nGoogle Nest Help Center\nChromecast Help Center",

From my experience, with an Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, I found having the Stick Min set to four worked for me, but again, your controller may be different.\nInputs Deadzone: Left Stick Min: 4\nInputs Deadzone: Left Stick Max: 80\nInputs Deadzone: Right Stick Min: 4\nInputs Deadzone: Left Stick Max: 100\nInputs Deadzone: Right Stick Max: 0.99\nInputs Deadzone: Left Trigger: 0\nIputs Deadzone: Right Trigger: 0\nAiming Horizontal Stick Sensitivity: 6 Vertical Stick Sensitivity: 6 ADS Sensitivity Multiplier: 0.80 Vertical Aim Axis: All Standard Tactical Stance Sensitivity Multiplier: 1.00 Aim Response Curve Type: Dynamic ADS Sens Multiplier (Focus): 1 ADS Sensitivity Transition Timing: Instant Custom Sensitivity per Zoom: On ADS Sens Multiplier (Low Zoom): 0.90\nADS Sens Multiplier (2x-3x Zoom): 0.90\nADS Sens Multiplier (4x-5x Zoom): 0.90\nADS Sens Multiplier (6x-7x Zoom): 0.90\nADS Sens Multiplier (8x-9x Zoom): 0.90\nADS Sens Multiplier (High Zoom): 0.90\nWhen it comes to the best Warzone controller settings, in my experience, the Dynamic Aim Response Curve Type gives you better control of your weapon when firing, allowing for more precision.\nAim Assist Target Aim Assist: On Aim Assist Type: Black Ops Although there's not much between them, I prefer the Black Ops Aim Assist over the Default Aim Assist option, but if you're used to the unique way that Precision Aim Assist works, it's probably better to stick with that.\nGameplay Automatic Sprint: Automatic Tactical Sprint\nAuto Move Forward: Off\nTactical Sprint Behaviour: Single Tap Sprint\nGrounded Mantle: Off\nAutomatic Airborne Mantle: Off\nAutomatic Ground Mantle/Hang: Off\nSlide/Dive Behaviour: Tap to Slide\nPlunging Underwater: Free\nParachute Auto-Deploy: Always\nSprinting Door Dash: On\nLedge Climb Behaviour: Mantle Only\nAim Down Sight Behaviour: Hold Change Zoom Activation: Sprint/Tactical Sprint/Focus Focus Behaviour: Hold Equipment Behaviour: Hold\nWeapon Mount Activation: ADS + Melee Weapon Mount Exit Delay: Medium Tactical Stance Activation: ADS + Down Button Tactical Stance Behaviour: On Toggle Interact/Reload Behaviour: Prioritize Interact Armor Plate Behaviour: Apply All Every other setting within the controller menu can be left as default, but follow the above guidelines for our best Warzone controller settings recommendations, to help you have an edge in Urzikstan and get those all-important eliminations. Now you've got this sorted, make sure you're running the best Warzone graphics settings , to give you an even bigger advantage over other players.",

    "title": "Irish attorney Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh delivers compelling legal case against Israel | International",
    "text": "Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh was probably surprised by the widespread praise for her powerful closing statement before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), in which she boldly accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza . Throughout her life, Ní Ghrálaigh’s unwavering convictions and experiences had prepared her to deliver this deeply personal and compassionate argument.\nWhen she was 12 years old, Ní Ghrálaigh came across a pamphlet about Majella O’Hare on her mother’s bookshelf. In 1976, a British paratrooper had shot the little girl in the back as she walked to church in the Northern Irish town of Whitecross. She shared this story during an interview with the Irish Legal News magazine in 2022 when she was selected as “lawyer of the month.”\nNí Ghrálaigh went to her mother in tears and asked how such a terrible thing could be allowed to happen. Her mother’s response to her young daughter was: “Do something about it”. Ní Ghrálaigh says: “I often think about my mother’s response. Her words struck a very profound chord. And I’ve hung on to that pamphlet over all these years. It’s now framed above my work desk as a reminder of what brought me here.”\nRegistered as a barrister (a lawyer specializing in courtroom advocacy and litigation) since 2005, Ní Ghrálaigh works at Matrix Chambers, a law firm with offices in London, Geneva and Brussels. She recently joined the South African legal team that has filed genocide charges against Israel before the ICJ in The Hauge, Netherlands.\nThe flexibility of the British educational system enables those with a strong passion for public service and justice to pursue a career in law, even if that wasn’t their original plan. Ní Ghrálaigh studied French and Latin at Queens’ College, Cambridge. It was only after completing her undergraduate degree that she discovered her interest in law and began to take the first steps toward that career.\nNí Ghrálaigh worked for a couple of years at an American think tank to save the money she would need for law school. The conventional course of studies in the UK enables law students to become solicitors — lawyers who are more focused on preparing cases and office work than on courtroom advocacy. However, one’s character determines their destiny. Ní Ghrálaigh’s activist nature led her to accept a position as a legal observer for the Northern Ireland Commission of Inquiry into Bloody Sunday , a significant episode of violence in Northern Ireland’s long-running sectarian conflict. On January 30, 1972, 14 unarmed civilians peacefully demonstrating for civil rights in the town of Londonderry were killed by the British army.\n“It was an immense privilege to be part of that historic legal process, and to get to represent and know the families, a number of whom remain friends to this day,” she told Irish Legal News . “Their unwavering dignity, resilience and steadfastness in seeking truth and justice over so many years was and remains utterly inspirational.” The case convinced Ní Ghrálaigh that her true calling was as a courtroom advocate.\nLondon was where Ní Ghrálaigh spent her childhood and teenage years, while family summers were always reserved for Ireland. She is fluent in Gaelic and has a good understanding of the island nation’s music and dance. Her mother, Neasa, grew up in Dublin but has roots in County Mayo on the west coast of Ireland, and she instilled in her daughters a strong commitment to Irish republicanism (the political movement for the unity and independence of Ireland).\nSolidarity with Palestine The Palestinian cause has stirred a groundswell of solidarity in Ireland, just as it has in South Africa. In 2009, Ní Ghrálaigh took part in a UN-commissioned legal observation mission in Gaza following Israel’s military invasion, known as Operation Cast Lead . “The level of devastation and trauma I witnessed in Gaza is hard to put into words. It was one of the experiences of my professional life that has marked me the most,” she said. When her mother died in 2011, the family asked for donations to the Palestine Solidarity Campaign instead of flowers.\nNí Ghrálaigh specializes in international humanitarian law and defending the right to protest. She has been involved in a number of high-profile legal cases, including Croatia’s charges of genocide against Serbia at the ICJ. The case that launched Ní Ghrálaigh to stardom was when she represented the only woman defendant of the “Colston Four” – Rhian Graham. The Colston Four were the protesters who were cleared in January 2022 by a jury of criminal damage for toppling a statue of slave trader Edward Colston during a Black Lives Matter protest.\nThe four defendants were acquitted in a landmark case that recognized powerful moral and social justice considerations within criminal norms. Ní Ghrálaigh successfully presented a “belief in consent” argument that the four defendants believed their attack on public property was justified as they thought the citizens of Bristol (England) supported the statue’s removal. They also claimed that honoring someone who was responsible for enslaving over 80,000 people and the death of 20,000 others was inherently criminal.\n“The Genocide Convention is about more than legal precedent. It is also fundamentally about the confirmation and endorsement of elementary principles of morality,” said Ní Ghrálaigh in her closing statement at the ICJ, before calling on the court to implement the provisional measures and cessation of Israeli attacks that are so urgently needed to prevent further irreparable harm to the Palestinian people in Gaza.\nDriven by an unwavering quest for moral justice, akin to the pursuit of destiny itself, Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh courageously stood in a courtroom once again to make herself heard by 17 magistrates and millions of global citizens.\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition\nMore information International justice and genocide in Gaza Diego García-Sayan Keys to South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the United Nations International Court of Justice Isabel Ferrer | The Hague Archived In Israel Hamás Benjamin Netanyahu UN Adheres to More information If you are interested in licensing this content, please contact ventacontenidos@prisamedia.com _",

    "title": "With strong Senate support, Florida moves closer to statewide fluoride ban",
    "text": "Nation\nWith strong Senate support, Florida moves closer to statewide fluoride ban\nFlorida is on its way to becoming the second state in the country to ban adding fluoride to public drinking water, parting with a practice once regarded among the greatest public health achievements of the last century.\nThe Republican-controlled state Senate approved a wide-ranging agricultural bill Wednesday that includes a provision ceasing fluoridation by cities and counties. The vote was 27-9.\nThe bill now goes to the Florida House, which is also GOP-controlled and where similar legislation has received favorable votes in committee. If approved, it would then head to Gov. Ron DeSantis' office, who almost certainly would sign the prohibition into law.\n\"We're here to hydrate, not medicate,\" said state Sen. Keith Truenow, R-Tavares, who sponsored the bill, before the vote. \"Here in Florida, we are saying no additives can be used in purifying water.\"\nOpponents of a statewide ban said it would lead to more tooth decay and other health issues, especially among young children in poor communities.\n\"This would honestly be a joke, if it didn't have dangerous consequences,\" said Tina Scott Polsky, D-Boca Raton, on the Senate floor before voting against the bill. \"Are any of us chemists? None of here are doctors. None of us are dentists.\"\nThe Florida Senate's move follows Utah, which became the first state last month to enact its ban. The state did so just weeks after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. - who has long expressed suspicion about the safety of water fluoridation - became secretary of Health and Human Services.\nEnding fluoridation, once a fringe issue, has gained increasing support across Florida after state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo last August spoke against injecting the cavity-fighting mineral into drinking water. He pointed to a study that found fluoride is linked to lower IQ in children.\nLadapo also has argued that adding fluoride to public water is no longer necessary because toothpaste and mouthwash provide protection against tooth decay.\nHowever, health experts say the studies Ladapo cites regarding toxicity involve fluoridation at much higher levels than what is allowed in public water systems in the United States, roughly 0.7 parts per million - about three drops in a 55-gallon barrel of water.\nThe National Institutes of Health has said it is \"virtually impossible\" to get toxic levels of fluoride from water with that amount of fluoride.\nThe American Dental Association has said that Ladapo was \"misinformed and making dangerous\" comments. The organization also pointed out that toothpaste supplements fluoridated water for good dental health.\nSince 1945, fluoride - a mineral naturally found in water and the soil - has been added to public drinking water systems across the country after it was discovered it helped prevent cavities and help prevent other forms of tooth decay.\nHealth experts and agencies - including the American Dental Association, American Academy of Pediatrics and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - have endorsed fluoridation as a way of providing poor children with a measure of dental care, who otherwise could not afford to go to a dentist.\nBut in the past several months, at least 14 Florida cities have agreed to discontinue fluoridation - including Lake Mary, Longwood, Tavares and Leesburg.\nLast week, Seminole County became the largest utility provider in Central Florida to stop adding fluoride to its drinking water supply before distributing it to roughly 40,000 customers.\nIn a 4-1 vote, Seminole commissioners made the move after several people spoke against fluoridation at recent meetings. However, several health professionals strongly urged Seminole's leaders to continue it.\nToday, only about one sixth of Florida's 23 million residents live in communities without fluoride in their water.\nIt's unclear whether the proposed legislation would apply to private utilities, such as neighborhoods with their own water distribution systems. According to the bill, the use \"of any additive in a public water system\" that does not improve water quality or remove contaminants would be prohibited.",
