    "text": "Hundreds of the protesters took to streets in the northwestern city of Peshawar Hundreds of supporters from Pakistani Islamist parties on Friday rallied to protest against what they say were blasphemous remarks by the country's chief justice. The protest call, by various religious and political groups led by hardline Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) whose rallying cry is \"death to blasphemers\", said that remarks by Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa in a case against a member of the minority Ahmadi community were blasphemous. The court had granted bail to an Ahmadi community member earlier this week, ruling that blasphemy charges against him did not stand. The man, accused of blasphemy for distributing Islamic literature, had been in jail for 13 months. \"We (will) monitor the sermons and protests outside mosques,\" said police official Abrar Hussain in the southern city of Karachi, warning the protesters to remain peaceful. Hundreds of the protesters took to streets in the northwestern city of Peshawar, chanting slogans against the chief justice, said police official Mubarak Khan. The top court on Thursday issued a statement after the Islamist parties and some political groups launched a campaign accusing the chief justice of deviating in his ruling from the constitutional definition of a Muslim, which excludes Ahmadis. \"This impression is absolutely wrong,\" the court statement said, deploring what it called a \"vicious campaign\" against Isa. The campaign against Isa was also joined by some supporters and aides of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who think a ruling by the chief justice stripping Khan's party of its symbol on ballots cost them votes in an election on Feb. 8. Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party's information secretary Rauf Hasan did not respond to a request for a comment. Human rights groups say Pakistan's harsh blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal scores, and just accusing someone of such a crime could lead to mob justice. Judges hesitate to take up such cases for fear of retribution, which leaves accused languishing in jail for years without cases being heard. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com Blasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan. No one has been executed by the state for it, but numerous accused have been lynched by outraged mobs.

Calls for urgent cyber reforms grow.\n\\nA chilling warning from Senator Mark Warner, Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has thrown the spotlight on a catastrophic telecom hack. Described as the worst telecom hack in our nation\\u2019s history,\\u201d this alleged China-linked breach has compromised sensitive surveillance data, including call records and private communications of high-ranking U.S. officials.\n\\nThe attack, reportedly executed by state-sponsored Chinese hackers, exploited vulnerabilities in U.S. telecom networks. Senator Warner stated:\n\\n This is an ongoing effort by China to infiltrate telecom systems globally and exfiltrate massive amounts of data.\n\\nThe breach has sparked grave concerns over U.S. cybersecurity infrastructure and its ability to defend against nation-state threats. Hackers intercepted surveillance data meant for law enforcement, raising fears about national security.\n\\nReports reveal that even presidential and vice-presidential candidates were targeted, along with senior political figures, amplifying the scope of the crisis. Beijing has denied involvement, but the implications are staggering.\n\\nThe breach, confirmed by the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), exposes significant weaknesses in critical U.S. infrastructure.\n\\n This breach is not just a technical failure; it\\u2019s a wake-up call for America.\n\\nThe attack has fueled debates on strengthening U.S. cyber defenses.

    "text": "Zuckerberg vs. Democracy Yaёl Eisenstat Fri, January 10, 2025 at 8:11 AM UTC 7 min read\nMARK ZUCKERBERG ANNOUNCED A SPATE of changes in Meta’s approach to speech and moderation issues this week, part of his longstanding effort to dominate the information landscape while resisting responsibility for his company’s contributions to political violence, extremism, and other antidemocratic activities in the United States and around the world. Let’s talk about the most serious implications.\nTwo of the key changes are that Meta will end fact-checking and roll back content moderation. According to reporting from 404 Media, many Meta employees were angry and felt blindsided by these changes, as there was not an internal policy and stakeholder engagement process driving the decision. This reinforces the impression that this is little more than a quid pro quo on Zuckerberg’s part for soliciting Trump’s help in pushing back against regulators. The full spectrum of changes will lead to even more hate and extremism while ignoring the systemic issues of how Meta’s platforms actually contribute to harm.\nIt’s important to note that this was not a sudden “bending the knee” to Donald Trump. Zuckerberg has a history of reacting to threats from politicians who have the power to impose costs on the company. I saw this tendency firsthand when I was hired by Facebook (now Meta) in 2018, ostensibly to head the company’s election-integrity efforts for political advertising.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement I proposed a plan —built and supported by engineers and program managers across the company—to ensure we were not allowing (and profiting from) ads that potentially engaged in voter suppression. We had the tools and ability to protect the integrity of the elections, which Zuckerberg had publicly promised to do. But it would have likely meant taking action against more content from candidates on the right, including Trump, because, as research has demonstrated, the right engaged in political misinformation at higher rates .\nZuckerberg knew this would come at a political cost, so he made it clear he would not fact-check political candidates—not even in paid advertising, and not even if those ads contained blatant lies about voting. And in 2020, after Trump threatened to “shut down” social media because Twitter fact-checked him, Zuckerberg went on Fox News to announce that he would retreat even further from fact-checking.\nStay rooted in the factual world by signing up to receive our independent journalism directly in your inbox.\nWhile Meta’s fact-checking program was never perfect, the company’s third-party fact-checkers and moderation policies did at least make an effort to ensure that lies, conspiracy theories, and deliberate disinformation didn’t spread unchecked across its platforms.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement That’s all gone now. Meta’s latest changes will have far-reaching consequences for public safety and democracy. Here are three key points:\n1. We must zoom out to see how social media platforms erode public safety and democracy. By zeroing in on fact-checking under the false guise of protecting free speech, Zuckerberg was appeasing his biggest right-wing critics while obfuscating the much more important issue at hand: his company’s own role in amplifying, recommending, and targeting content that has contributed to extremism, illegal activity , and even political violence (e.g., pogroms against the Rohingya in Myanmar or the January 6th insurrection in the United States).\nThese companies are not just neutral pipes through which speech flows. They curate each user’s feed based on algorithmic decision-making and priorities set by the owners. As long as Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and other major social-media owners continue to have complete, unchecked power to tune their algorithms to decide whose voices are amplified, whose are silenced, which content is recommended, and how ads are targeted to us, they will have unrivaled influence over how we engage with and trust in information—with none of the responsibility for the consequences.\nWe cannot ignore the evidence. Studies from independent researchers , civil society groups , and Meta’s own internal researchers have shown time and time again that content promoting hatred, misinformation, and extremism outperforms more balanced, nuanced discourse on major social media platforms. This is no accident. It’s the result of an algorithmic design that rewards engagement, regardless of whether that engagement is based on truth or toxicity. Meta’s core business model incentivizes sensationalism, and Zuckerberg knows it. In the quest for more clicks, likes, and shares, the company has given unchecked power to algorithms that often prioritize inflammatory content over anything that could foster understanding or constructive conversation. The reward of algorithmically boosted virality is far more consequential than any one post from an individual user, and that is where responsibility should lie.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in Business Costco shoppers can kiss goodbye a free membership perk TheStreet Alaska Airlines Exec on Competition with Delta, Possibility of Mileage Plan Change, and More Travel+Leisure Bugatti Bolide’s First U.S. Track Outing Delivers Unparalleled Thrill at COTA Modern Car Collector US firm to bury nuclear reactors 1-mile underground to power data centers Interesting Engineering Fact-checking, while important, was never a perfect solution to this problem. Once harmful content is boosted by the algorithm, fact-checks are not likely to reach those who are already influenced by the content, nor to change anyone’s mind.\nShare\n2. Hate and extremism will likely spread even more. While Zuckerberg spoke publicly about ending fact-checking, Meta also quietly rolled back multiple “ Hateful Coduct ” policies, including safety guardrails for LGBTQ people, people of color, women, immigrants, and other protected groups. We’ve seen the real-world consequences of unchecked amplification of group hatred on Facebook and Instagram, and I fear that is going to become even worse. It is worth remembering that Meta’s policies developed slowly over time , often after episodes of real world-violence, including genocide , that had been traced back in part to Facebook. Extremism is on the rise around the world, and if Meta is welcoming hate-filled content, the idea that extremists won’t use the platform to accelerate real-world harm is just naïve.\n3. Political quid pro quo is no longer subtle. Zuckerberg’s changes are catering to Trump’s desires in return for asking for Trump’s protection. While corporations have long tried to curry favor with governments, it used to be done quietly. The fact that Zuckerberg openly said that he is enlisting Trump’s help to pressure global regulators to not enforce their own laws in their own countries should concern anyone who cares about global democracy. What used to be considered undemocratic behavior and relegated to smoke-filled back rooms is now proudly announced by the dealers themselves.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Trump pressured Zuckerberg to stop a program that he didn’t like, and in exchange, Zuckerberg is gambling on Trump’s authoritarian impulses to bully other countries to allow Meta to operate unchecked in the world. This decision is not only politically motivated; it is dangerous in its disregard for both the sovereignty of other countries and the global impact of Meta’s platforms. And it was all done in plain sight.\nWhere do we go from here? WE MUST UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING if we want to have any hope of correcting course. The path forward requires something much more fundamental than tinkering with existing models for content moderation: It requires a radical rethinking of how Meta and other social media platforms design their algorithms and profit from the use of their users’ data.\nThese companies must be held accountable, not necessarily for the content they host but for the design and back-end choices that encourage harmful content to flourish in the first place. Until we address the business model that makes things like hate and extremism profitable, we will continue to see these problems grow—as will the damage to our society.\nAnd in the absence of any intention on Zuckerberg’s part to even attempt a course-correction, it is up to the public to change their relationship with these companies. We must finally insist on transparency about how these systems truly affect our lives, and on some form of accountability for the way these companies’ own tools and business decisions have serious consequences for public safety and democracy.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Share this article on a social media platform of your choice.\nShare",

Following the footsteps of her family's past five generations, Jozsefne Szedlak is one of the few remaining bell ringers in Hungary.

    "text": "ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MAXICO, UNITED STATES, February 15, 2024 /\nEINPresswire.com/ -- In an era where digital entertainment and environmental conservation seem worlds apart, one company has launched an initiative that bridges this gap with a groundbreaking approach. \"Hawa the Game\" alongside its literary counterpart \"The Legend of Hawa: The Beginning,\" and the dedicated website https://hawathegame.com, are at the forefront of a movement that empowers individuals to contribute positively to the climate crisis through the mediums they love: gaming and reading.\nDeveloped with the aim to inspire action and awareness regarding climate change, \"Hawa the Game\" is not just another mobile game. It is a call to action for players to recognize their daily impact on the environment. Astonishingly, each person exhales approximately 2.3lbs of CO2 daily, contributing to the significant amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by the global population. Recognizing this, the creators of Hawa the Game have made it their mission to offer a simple yet effective solution to combat this issue.\nBy making in-game purchases of just $10, players can directly contribute to the planting of real trees in protected forests across the United States. This initiative not only makes it fun and easy for people to get involved in environmental conservation but also educates them on the importance of their contributions. The company has calculated that planting just 20 trees can sequester the amount of CO2 a person exhales over their lifetime, effectively turning them from CO2 exhalers into oxygen producers.\nParallel to the game, \"The Legend of Hawa: The Beginning,\" the first\nbook in an engaging eBook series available on Kindle since January 10th, 2024, provides readers with a rich background on the characters and the world within the game. The proceeds from the book sales are also dedicated to supporting the tree-planting initiative, further extending the impact readers and players can have on the environment.\nThe website hawathegame.com serves as a hub for the community, offering more information on the game, the book series, and the overarching mission of the company. It is a place for individuals to learn, engage, and contribute to a cause that goes beyond digital entertainment.\n\"We believe that everyone has a role to play in combating climate change, and through \"Hawa the Game\" and \"The Legend of Hawa,\" we are making it easier and more enjoyable for people to take on that responsibility,\" said Rahim, founder of Hawa LLC. \"Our initiative is proof that when we come together, even through platforms like gaming and reading, we can make a significant impact on the world.\"\nJoin the movement by downloading \"Hawa the Game\" reading \"The Legend of Hawa: The Beginning,\" and becoming part of a community dedicated to making a difference. Together, we can turn the tide on climate change, one tree at a time.\nAddress:\n1213 Mary Ellen St NE ABQ, NM 87112\nRahim Samji\nCEO Hawa LLC\n+1 505-377-2880\n[[email protected]]https://kalkinemedia.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0d7f6c6564604d656c7a6c7965686a6c6068236e6260\nVisit us on social media:",

    "title": "Audi A5 e Q6 Sportback e-tron, Faraò: “Lo stato dell’arte della tecnologia termica ed elettrica” [FOTO e VIDEO]",
    "text": "Massimo Faraò , direttore marketing di Audi Italia, ci ha raccontato le novità che la Casa dei Quattro Anelli ha portato al Salone di Parigi 2024, dove gli occhi sono puntati sulla nuova generazione dell’ Audi Q5 e sulla nuova Audi Q6 Sportback e-tron .\nFaraò : “Qui a Parigi celebriamo l’offensiva di prodotto con i lanci di A6 e-tron e Q6 Sportback e-tron per quanto riguarda i prodotti elettrici, di A5 erede dell’icona A4 e del SUV Q5. Entrambe queste coppie di vetture sfruttano piattaforme tecnologiche modernissime sia per quanto riguarda la tecnologia termica che quella elettrica. La tecnologia termica è l’applicazione dello stato dell’arte di motori benzina, diesel e ibridi che garantiranno prestazioni dal punto di vista sostenibile molto importanti, perché garantiranno la riduzione delle emissioni e soprattutto la riduzione dei consumi di oltre il 10%, in particolare su A5 e Q5″.\n“Poi c’è il piacere di guida, – continua Faraò – perché queste vetture con il loro telaio garantiranno delle performance dinamica straordinarie, da vere e proprie Audi. Poi abbiamo il pianale elettrico , sviluppato insieme ai nostri colleghi di Porsche. Pianale che per efficienza, per autonomia e per tempi di ricarica è il massimo dell’efficienza funzionale , perché in qualche modo permette ai prodotti elettrici di avere un’esperienza e una praticità che si avvicina verso quella dei prodotti termici evoluti”.\nLe caratteristiche La nuova Audi Q5 ammoderna il design del popolare SUV del marchio di Ingolstadt arricchendosi con un’evoluta dotazione tecnologica che prevede il debutto del nuovo sistema d’infotainment con Android Automotive OS, comandi vocali e ChatGPT. La digitalizzazione degli interni è ben espressa di tre display che formano il palcoscenico dell’Audi Digital Stege dominando il cruscotto.\nLa nuova Audi Q5 sarà disponibile sul mercato italiano con tre motorizzazioni elettrificate con il sistema mild-hybrid 48 V. Dotate di cambio automatico S tronic a 7 marce, le tre opzioni previste al lancio sono: il benzina 2.0 TFSI da 204 CV, il diesel 2.0 TDI da 204 CV e il V6 3.0 TSI da 367 CV che equipaggia la SQ5. In un secondo momento arriveranno anche le motorizzazioni ibrida plug-in ad ampliare la gamma della Q5.\nPer quanto riguarda invece l’ Audi Q6 Sportback e-tron , la versione elettrica del SUV-Coupé dei Quattro Anelli proporrà quattro versioni, con due tagli di batteria agli ioni di litio. La versione entry-level dispone di motore elettrico posteriore che sviluppa 252 CV, con batteria da 75,8 kWh per 545 chilometri d’autonomia. C’è poi la variante con motore da 306 CV e batteria da 94,9 kWh che dichiara un’autonomia di 655 km. Le altre due opzioni, che saranno introdotte successivamente, sono una versione S e una più potente versione RS.",

    "title": "Missing hiker found alive after spending 10 days in Northern California mountains | How he survived",
    "text": "SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. -- A missing Northern California hiker is back home after spending more than a week in the mountains, and the heartfelt reunion was all captured in photos. Lukas McClish, 34, said spent 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains. On Tuesday, June 11, McClish headed out for a three-hour hike from his hometown of Boulder Creek. He said he got lost and didn't recognize certain landmarks wiped out by fires. When he didn't show up for Father's Day dinner, he was declared missing on Sunday, June 16. Four days later, McClish was rescued. \"I'm tired and a little sore, I lost my voice,\" McClish said. We spoke with McClish on Friday about what he had on him at the time. \"I left with just a pair of pants, and my pair of hiking shoes, and a hat. I had a flashlight, and a pair of folding scissors, like a Leatherman tool. And that was about it,\" McClish said. The sheriff's office said McClish had no major injuries. McClish said he survived on drinking lots of water. \"I just make sure I drank a gallon of water every day, but then after, getting close to the end of it, my body needed food and some kind of sustenance,\" McClish said. The Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office said they deployed drones. The Cal Fire San Mateo-Santa Cruz unit, the Boulder Creek Fire Department and CA State Parks assisted in the search. The Sheriff's Office said around 3 p.m. on Thursday, witnesses reported hearing someone yelling for help. McClish was found in a remote canyon in Big Basin State Park. He was moved to see all the boots and paws on the ground looking for him. \"It was just really humbling and I don't know, it was an awesome experience,\" McClish said. Both him and his family are feeling grateful for all the help they've received. And they won't be hitting the trails anytime soon. \"I did enough hiking for probably the whole rest of the year,\" he said \"Me too,\" his dad said. \"We've all hiked a lot,\" his mom said.",
