    "text": "[Token Unlocks](/token-unlock) [Watchlist](/watchlist) [Portfolio](/portfolio) [Rewards](/earn) Best Crypto to Buy Now December 28 – Bitcoin SV, Aave, Arbitrum Select cryptocurrencies are exhibiting bullish behavior to close out the year, making them potentially among the best cryptos to buy now–with Bitcoin SV rallying nearly 80%, Aave surging alongside Ethereum, and Arbitrum’s price increasing on the heels of layer 2 optimism. Meanwhile, ongoing crypto presales like Sponge V2 and Meme Kombat are also attracting investor attention. Best Crypto to Buy Now in the News Bitcoin SV’s (BSV) price has seen a notable increase, with a 53.74% rise yesterday to $76.78 and an additional 16.46% surge today to $89.30. This upward trend has sparked discussions on the sustainability of its rapid growth. Technical indicators suggest that while the upward movement is strong, the current conditions may be overextended. Upbit’s share of trading volume has been pivotal for BSV’s performance, but reliance on this volume raises questions about the rally’s future. The decentralized finance token Aave is currently priced around $117.41, with whale activities contributing to its recent price action. A notable withdrawal of AAVE tokens from Binance by a large investor indicates a positive sentiment towards the asset. Furthermore, Aave’s value has surged alongside Ethereum, which recently reached $2,400. The high correlation coefficient of 0.92 between ETH and AAVE prices suggests that Aave’s future could be closely tied to Ethereum’s market movements. Arbitrum, a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, has seen a 20% increase in value in just 24 hours, a rise that aligns with the growing interest in layer 2 technologies. The Arbitrum ecosystem has expanded, with a 50% growth in developer headcount year-over-year. Such growth underscores the platform’s attractiveness and potential for further adoption. I've posted some updates on $ARB. Retest at $0.98 did work, continuation towards $1.35 as well and even further. Some beautiful S/R flips, I think $1.40-1.45 should hold and we can continue to $2. pic.twitter.com/wIFEg26zq8 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 28, 2023 Analysts like Michael van de Poppe have a positive outlook for ARB, with expectations of a bullish continuation that could see the token approach the $2 mark. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s commendation for Arbitrum as a stage 1 roll-up adds to the platform’s credibility and may influence its market performance. With these established tokens making headlines, the crypto presales market is not far behind. Projects like Sponge V2 and Meme Kombat are stepping into the spotlight, offering Bitcoin alternatives worth checking. These early-stage projects are creating a buzz with their unique propositions and are being closely watched by investors considering diversifying their cryptocurrency portfolios. As the year draws to a close, these cryptocurrencies and crypto presales demonstrate the broad selection of Bitcoin alternatives in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin SV, Aave, and Arbitrum have solidified their positions as some of the best crypto to buy now, with each demonstrating unique factors that appeal to different segments of investors. Meanwhile, presales like Sponge V2 and Meme Kombat present opportunities for those looking to get in on the ground floor of promising new crypto ventures. BSV Price Rockets 16.46%: Resistance and Support Levels to Watch The Bitcoin SV (BSV) price has seen an astounding rally over the past two days, with the cryptocurrency currently up by nearly 80%. This intense surge comes amidst rising trading volumes from major South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Upbit. However, with the spike in volume primarily originating from this singular exchange, BSV’s rally could lose momentum if conviction fades. Examining the key BSV price technical indicators paints a mixed picture. The 20-day EMA stands at $55.79 while the 50-day EMA sits at $51.15, with the BSV price well above both at $89.30. Typically, a price above its short and long-term EMAs signals bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) has shot up to 87.27 from 83.05 yesterday. This shows BSV is heavily overbought, signaling the price could be due for a pullback. The MACD histogram sits at 3.48, a sizable increase from yesterday’s 1.69. The growing positive value indicates a strengthening bullish sentiment behind the BSV price. With BSV stabilizing north of $80, technical indicators remain conflicted. While overbought RSI hints at downside potential, surging volume and MACD highlight raging bullish momentum. Trading within defined risk limits while awaiting confirmation may be wise. A break past immediate resistance between $98.85 and $102.10 could signal an extended upswing. Meanwhile, support at the Fib 0.236 and 0.382 levels of $84.89 and $77.38 could cushion any declines. The near-term direction will likely hinge on whether or not conviction holds as the BSV price ventures into overbought territory. AAVE Price Struggles to Hold Gains: Fib 0.236 Level as Immediate Resistance The AAVE price has seen bullish momentum for the past few days, with the cryptocurrency up over 4% so far today. AAVE is attempting to break out past key resistance levels after setting a new year-to-date high of $129.88 earlier today. However, the AAVE price has struggled to retain its gains and is currently trading below the Fib 0.236 level of $119.79. This area could act as immediate resistance if AAVE closes below this level. Examining key technical indicators shows there are mixed signals for AAVE’s price. The 20-day EMA stands at $102.88, above the 50-day EMA of $97.18, which is typically seen as a bullish sign. However, the closeness of these EMAs indicates high volatility and uncertainty for the AAVE price. The RSI is currently at 71.35, up from yesterday’s 66.87 and approaching overbought territory. This suggests upward momentum is building. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram sits at 1.25, an increase over yesterday’s 0.52. The growing positive value points to strengthening bullish sentiment. With the AAVE price stabilizing above crucial support levels, indicators remain balanced between further upside and potential pullback. Trading within defined risk limits while awaiting confirmation of a breakout past resistance at $119.79 or support at the Fib 0.5 level of $108.53 may be prudent. A decisive close above the $120 resistance or a drop below the $108 support zone could set the trend for the AAVE price over the coming days. Careful risk management is key amidst the mixed signals. ARB Struggles to Extend Higher: Potential Near-Term Weakness Ahead The Arbitrum (ARB) price saw increased volatility yesterday after breaking out from a period of consolidation and posting gains of 13.51%. However, despite setting a new multi-month high earlier today, ARB is struggling to extend higher so far today, pointing to potential near-term weakness. Currently trading around $1.50, the ARB price is down 0.44% so far today. This marks a pullback after ARB hit a multi-month high of $1.6691 earlier in the session. With the cryptocurrency facing resistance confluent with key Fib levels, ARB appears set for a potential correction. Looking at technical indicators, the 20-day EMA for ARB stands at $1.2682, above the 50-day EMA at $1.1568. This bullish crossover shows upside momentum in the short term. However, ARB trading back below the 20-day EMA could signal waning momentum. The RSI for ARB is currently reading 68.41, down slightly from 69 yesterday. This shows bullish momentum slowing despite remaining in overbought territory above 70. The fading RSI highlights the potential for a pullback after the recent surge. At the same time, the MACD histogram sits at 0.0308, up from 0.0288 yesterday. The histogram growing more positive indicates bullish momentum remains intact. However, a histogram rollover could foreshadow an ARB price drop. With the ARB price around $1.50, the cryptocurrency is testing resistance between $1.5740 and $1.6085. This area aligns with the Fib -0.382 level at $1.5861. A failure here signals potential downside ahead. On support, ARB shows the previous resistance zone of $1.4188 to $1.4637 in focus. This area could catch a pullback after flipping to support. Below that, the Fib 0.382 and 0.236 levels around $1.35 mark the next key support zone. Analyzing volume and market cap provides added context. ARB saw its market cap climb to $321 million, up from $308 million yesterday. However, 24-hour trading volume fell to just $19 million. The diverging metrics highlight uncertainty. Overall, after spiking to multi-month highs, the ARB price appears vulnerable to a pullback as bullish momentum slows. The test of resistance confluent with extended Fib levels underscores risks. Against this backdrop, trading within defined risk limits seems prudent. A decisive break above $1.60 resistance or a drop below $1.35 support could set the stage for the next major trending move. In the near term, ranging could persist for ARB while awaiting the next catalyst. While major cryptocurrencies grapple with near-term directional uncertainty, speculative crypto presales offer exposure to new ecosystems. Sponge V2 and Meme Kombat exemplify this, merging memes and gaming with cryptocurrencies. Navigating New Avenues in Cryptocurrency: A Look at Proming Bitcoin Alternatives The cryptocurrency market, traditionally anchored by Bitcoin, is witnessing a growing interest in developing blockchain projects. This trend is a departure from the usual focus on established market leaders, signaling a strategic shift among investors. These new projects, like Sponge V2 and Meme Kombat, are increasingly catching the eye of savvy investors. Their potential for growth in the early stages is a key factor in their rising popularity. This shift indicates a move towards a more diversified investment approach, focusing on developmental cryptocurrencies rather than mainstream ones. Investing in these developing crypto ventures, particularly through presale opportunities, presents a unique chance for early involvement in their growth trajectory. For those looking to diversify their cryptocurrency portfolios, paying attention to these Bitcoin alternatives could be a wise decision. The concept of the ‘best crypto to buy now’ is evolving. It’s no longer just about the most popular names in the market. Bitcoin alternatives, often lesser-known but with substantial growth potential, are becoming increasingly relevant. Sponge Token Success Sparks Excitement for Sponge V2 Presale: Is It the Best Crypto to Buy Now? The meme coin Sponge (SPONGE) is launching a presale for its second version, Sponge V2 (SPONGEV2), coming on the heels of the success of the original meme coin in May. The first Sponge Token saw substantial gains during the recent memecoin boom, reaching a peak market capitalization of nearly $100 million. Now, Sponge V2 seeks to build on that momentum with an upgraded meme coin. Important Reminder! You must take your staked $SPONGE tokens from the V1 staking contract and stake them in our V2 smart contract. You can do this via our website to secure your share of the V2 token once it launches. #SpongeCoin #Web3 #Crypto pic.twitter.com/u2HKxKz3cM — $SPONGE (@spongeoneth) December 28, 2023 According to the Sponge V2 website, the new token will introduce staking rewards and a play-to-earn game. Sponge V2 will be launching as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain through a bridging method the team calls “stake-to-bridge.” Holders of the original Sponge Token can stake their tokens to earn Sponge V2 tokens when they launch. Sponge V1 tokens staked will be locked permanently in the V2 staking pool and accumulate V2 tokens over four years. The Sponge V2 presale seeks to further capitalize on the meme coin hype and offer staking rewards of up to 613% APY to draw in buyers. The project said on social media that the presale seeks to “absorb liquidity and establish dominance in the crypto space.” Sponge V2 has allocated 26.93% of the token supply for bridging from V1, 43.09% for staking rewards, and 10% to centralized exchange liquidity. The tokenomics also include allocations for marketing, game development, and play-to-earn rewards. The original Sponge Token gained traction during the recent surge of interest in meme coins. Now, the team behind that project is leveraging its community and marketing playbook to try and replicate the success with Sponge V2. While meme coins remain highly speculative assets, the Sponge ecosystem has already proven it can attract substantial hype. The Sponge V2 presale offers an opportunity for those interested in the meme coin space to get in early before the new token launches.

Powered by artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, the outcomes of these PvP clashes will be randomly determined. Players can stake Meme Kombat tokens and bet on match results, earning MK token rewards when their selected meme fighter wins.

The game will feature fan-favorite memes like SpongeBob, Wojak, and Shiba Inu as playable characters to attract engagement. Leading the project are founder Matt Whiteman and his public-facing development team. Whiteman’s credentials are viewable on LinkedIn, underscoring Meme Kombat’s commitment to transparency. Meme Kombat’s tokenomics allocate 50% of tokens to presale participants, 30% to staking rewards, 10% to liquidity pools, and 10% to community initiatives. This distribution intends to incentivize presale buyers to actively participate post-launch by gaming and staking their MK tokens. While risky like any crypto investment, Meme Kombat provides a unique value proposition through its creative fusion of memes and play-to-earn gaming. The presale’s strong momentum highlights enthusiastic demand for Meme Kombat’s interactive platform. As the token sale enters its final stages, the closing period often gives buyers the optimal window to acquire tokens before exchange listings.

    "title": "Melco Resorts: Best Dice Roll In The Gaming Sector For 2024",
    "text": "The shares of Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited (NASDAQ:\nMLCO) have taken a beating despite the ebullient recovery of revenue post covid in Macau and in all of Asia. The key bearish culprit: MLCO’s debt burden, which on any basis is a big time grizzly for sure. The huge load is from the accumulation of two factors. One, the burning ambition of its CEO, Lawrence Ho, member of Asia gaming’s most famous and successful family. And two the incendiary cash burn the company and all its peers had to endure through two and a half years of covid disaster.\nAbove: Not a value trap, but a powerful recovery story in progress,\nLawrence Ho, in his mid-forties, is an empire builder in gaming who has never hesitated to expand, primarily with debt, the Asian footprint of MLCO. And on many tosses of the dice he has come out a winner. He is the only son of legendary gaming titan Stanley Ho (1921-2020), the brother of sisters Pansy and Daisy, both active in gaming as well in SJM and MGM China.\nHo is a shot taker. He saw stirrings when Russia moved to develop its Far East for gaming with a North China facing potential in 2013. The idea of developing a major resort there targeting the wealth base over the border made sense. Yet, by 2018, he suddenly abandoned the project.\nMoscow lawmakers were pussyfooting around investment there as well as imposing higher taxes and fuzzy regulations.\nHo concluded the Russians were incompetent to develop a gaming destination. The same year, Ho pivoted to Japan where casino gambling was finally passed after a raucous political war. He planned a major IR, but subsequently, as most of his Asian peers, he abandoned the project because of endless political maneuvering and delay among anti-gaming forces and skyrocketing estimates of development costs.\nHo took his L’s in Russia and Japan and left. But his global vision continued with more capex in Macau, expansion of his Manila City of Dreams property, and finally his move to the island of Cyprus. His COD Mediterranean which is finished, is the only true state of the art integrated casino resort in the geographical access to the Middle East and Europe.\nBut a flock of black Covid shut down swans swam into his pond at the same time between 2019 and 2022. This disaster caught MLCO having to beef up its\nbalance sheet with borrowings at the same time its capex expansions in Macau, Manila and oncoming Cyprus caused a cash squeeze, sending the company to the banks. MLCO now sits on a $8.5b debt hangover with a cash and FCF position that raises eyebrows as to whether it can meet 2024 maturities. It says it can, many analysts agree. It has over $2b in unused lending available as needed.\nAt the same time, the news is good and getting better for MLCO as its two top markets, Macau and Manila are in a powerful revenue recovery cycle. Results in 2024 should produce a free cash flow, or FCF, that could well meet all cash needs. Cyprus, brand new, will continue to underperform its huge potential because of the Ukraine and Gaza wars. But if and when they end, that property should be a significant EBITDA contributor to the group. Its geography is aimed at money and tourist centers in the Mideast, and the EU.\nSo, the proposition here is this: MLCO debt is a problem. It is big enough to turn off many would-be investors who do like the Asian gaming recovery overall. But at its current price, given its footprint and the continuing Asia revenue recovery pace, it begins to look like a savvy dice roll for investors who see beyond the immediate crisis. You might consider it a buy if you have a generally higher risk tolerance than the average punter in the sector. The rewards could be bigger and come faster than many think.\nThe big debt MLCO grizzly bear at this writing\nTotal long-term debt as of Q3 2023 $8.3b\nAv cost 5.8%\nNet debt: 4.5X Not pretty, but workable given the plus EBITDA momentum of MLCO properties in recovering markets. MLCO has refinanced significant loan maturities with higher capital amounts.\nCapitalized leases: $198m\nCash and cash equivalents at 9/3023 $1.54b (124m in restricted cash).\nMLCO paid down $100m on debt during the quarter.\nMLCO has refinanced and extended the maturity on a secured loan of $175b to $250m\nCurrent ratio: 1.65.\nThe takeaway: MLCO’s debt profile cannot be swept away out of the overall consideration in opening a position at this time. However, the momentum of FCF both in Macau and Manila ahead plus the extension of some secured loan maturities seems adequate. The company’s capex at $61.1m is almost all attributable to the finishing of Phase Two Studio City Macau and final work on the Cyprus property.\nStrategy\nAbove: A smart dice roll, not a value trap, when its markets are surging with recovery cycles beyond most original forecasts.\nHere’s how we see the MLCO play right now:\nEntry point $8.50 a share. Underweight in the sense that we see opening a position as a toe dip on a potential accumulate later on as we get news of MLCOs 4Q23 numbers in February. If they come in strong as did 3Q, we see a likely upside around $10 to $12. At that point if you are already in at $8.50 you might want to price average at $10 for example, by increasing your position to get you somewhere around $9.75 before we get reporting on 1Q24.\nIt’s then we believe that the epiphany arrives that could drive the shared by early 2Q24 to our intermediate upside range with a price target, or PT, at $18.76. We see 2024 delivering ~ $1.18 in earnings with a balance sheet far better cushioned than today.\nOutlook in brief\nMacau GGR has reached 57% of baseline 2029 We expect it to rise to ~$26b, to $28.5b next year. With City of Dreams expansion against MLCO’s estimated 16% market share now held yields in theory $4.8b in gaming revenue. There are always contingencies. Our best estimate is that at least MLCO will gain up to $3.6b to $3.8b TTM in total revenue. We say in theory because hold percentage swings on the baccarat game are unpredictable over the short term. And there could be a challenge for market share from other major operators in Macau next year who have also expanded capacity.\nPhilippine officials have forecast that the GGR of that market—Asia’s fastest growing will hit $5b and continue growing to 2027/8 to $10b. MLCO’s City of Dreams in the entertainment zone will participate in that growth.\nCyprus: With two ongoing wars with no prospects in sight of any endings, the MLCO property here will have to continue to depend on brave West European gamers ad tourists as such its ability to contribute accretive EBITDA to the group will be limited. Not ended, but limited.\nConclusion\nRegardless of the current debt concerns, MLCO isn’t going anywhere. In fact, it is swiftly recovering lost revenue in both its key markets. It is likely to meet debt obligations this year and veer to at least break even if not positive EBITDA.\nThe downside risk is not missing, but falls within what we see to be reasonable given the upside potential at a price we believe does not yet reflect the value of a company with a big footprint in two of Asia’s most fertile, recovering gaming markets.\nThe House Edge is widely recognized as the only marketplace service on the casino/gaming/online sports betting sectors, researched, written and available to SA readers by Howard Jay Klein, a 30 year c-suite veteran of the gaming industry.

    "text": "La Cabalgata de Reyes de San Antonio de Benagéber pone el broche de oro a una Navidad de cercanía Miles de vecinos y vecinas de San Antonio de Benagéber no han querido perderse este viernes la llegada de Melchor, Gaspar y Baltasar a la localidad. La tradicional Cabalgata de Reyes Magos ha iluminado el municipio con alegría y magia desde la calle Vereda donde Sus Majestades de Oriente han seguido el tradicional recorrido hasta su llegada a la Plaza del Ayuntamiento. Allí, han realizado el real saludo desde el edificio consistorial, para proceder después al reparto de regalos entre los más pequeños. El espectáculo, en el que han participado más de 150 integrantes, ha estado encabezado por un vehículo de la Policía Local, seguido de diversas entidades y agrupaciones. De esta manera, ha destacado la participación de la Sociedad Musical de San Antonio de Benagéber, la Sociedad Amigos de la Música, el grupo scout Tatanka, las comisiones falleras locales y los miembros de Protección Civil, que han completado la comitiva de las tres imponentes carrozas desde donde los Reyes Magos han repartido 300 kilos de caramelos, para posteriormente entregar más de 1.500 presentes. El encuentro ha puesto el broche de oro a una Navidad en las que el Ayuntamiento ha coordinado más de una veintena de actividades, entre las que ha destacado la gran acogida de las citas musicales, así como la buena respuesta de la pista de patinaje instalada en el polideportivo municipal, una de las grandes novedades de este año. En esta línea, la concejala delegada del área de Fiestas, María José Esteve, ha mostrado su satisfacción ante la “exitosa acogida de las actividades organizadas por el Ayuntamiento”, así como ha agradecido “la buena respuesta de toda la comunidad y el tejido social de San Antonio de Benagéber en su organización”. Apuesta por la proximidad Del mismo modo se ha mostrado la alcaldesa de la localidad, Eva María Tejedor, que ha subrayado que uno de los “principales objetivos del equipo de gobierno era beneficiar a nuestros comerciantes y empresarios locales con la organización de las fiestas, apostando por la proximidad, para impulsar la economía de nuestro pueblo”. Precisamente, la alcaldesa ha expresado su gratitud con el sector del ocio y servicios del municipio, que ha “enriquecido con su talento y profesionalidad nuestras celebraciones”. La representante también ha hecho hincapié en la apuesta del ejecutivo para hacer llegar la Navidad a más barrios. En este sentido, Eva María Tejedor ha recordado que “frente a otros equipos de gobierno que limitaban la decoración navideña al núcleo urbano, este Ayuntamiento ha hecho un gran esfuerzo para llevar el ambiente festivo también a urbanizaciones como San Vicente, Colinas, Cumbres o Montesano”. “Este ejecutivo está comprometido con acercar las fiestas a los vecinos de cada rincón de la localidad, independientemente de su ubicación”, ha concluido la alcaldesa.",

    "text": "Jagtial : It was a grand celebration at the Kondagattu Anjaneya Swamy Temple packed with devotees as many as two lakhs in number, who rushed from midnight on Friday for darshan and continued to do so until Saturday afternoon.Officials reported that around 2,00,000 devotees visited the temple and completed their rituals. The large number of devotees made it difficult for the police to control the crowd. As the number of devotees increased outside the temple, it took about three hours for the devotees to have a darshan of the deity. The sudden influx of devotees caused a stampede, resulting in a devotee breaking his arm.Meanwhile, officials conducted grand Hanuman Jayanti celebrations, decorating the temple with flowers and performing various rituals. These included Thirumanjanam (sacred bath), Dravida Prabandha Parayanam (chanting of Tamil scriptures), Havan (fire ritual), Panchamrita Abhishekam (ablution with five nectars), Sahasra Nagavalli Archana (thousand-leaf worship), Tulasi Dala Archana (basil leaf worship), and Homa (fire sacrifice). The midday rituals included Purnahuti (final offering), Ooyala Seva (swing service), Mantrapushpam (flower offering), and Maha Nivedana (grand offering). After the ceremonies, devotees were given sacred offerings (Teertha Prasadam).",

    "text": "According to the Iranian Foreign Ministry, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) will increase the number of centrifuges used to enrich uranium. This will be a response to the anti-Iranian resolution adopted by the IAEA Board of Governors on November 21.\nThe resolution, drafted by Western countries including the UK, Germany, France and the USA, accuses Tehran of insufficient cooperation with the organization.\nLet us remind you that Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has warned to take decisive measures if the IAEA makes an unconstructive decision regarding Iran's nuclear program.\n\"The nature of Iran's possible response was previously communicated to the Director General of the IAEA... On this basis, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran ordered effective measures to be taken, including the launch of a significant number of new advanced centrifuges of various types\",\nthe Iranian Foreign Ministry said.\nAccording to the Foreign Ministry, subsequent measures by the Islamic Republic will be implemented in order to protect national interests, as well as for development in connection with the growing needs of the peaceful nuclear industry \"within the framework of the rights and obligations provided for by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)\".",
