    "text": "[Shaquille O’Neal’s](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/614/shaquille-o%27neal) poignant revelation serves as a stark reminder of life’s fragility, urging everyone to cherish their loved ones without delay. In a 2022 appearance on Logan Paul’s Impaulsive podcast, O’Neal shared profound advice prompted by his own painful experiences. The retired NBA star, known for his busy schedule, admitted to a habit of procrastination. However, this changed dramatically after two tragic phone calls within three months. In October 2019, he received the devastating news of his sister Ayesha Harrison-Jex losing her battle with cancer. Despite overcoming the disease twice before, she succumbed at the age of 40. Then, in January 2020, while working out with his son Shaqir, O’Neal learned of the tragic helicopter accident that claimed the lives of his former teammate Kobe Bryant, Kobe’s daughter Gianna, and seven others.

    "title": "Bangalore Braces for Heavy Rainfall: IMD Predicts Intense Showers Till December 14",
    "text": "The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has sounded a yellow alert for Bengaluru, cautioning residents about significant rainfall expected over the next few days. On Thursday, the city experienced moderate showers under consistently cloudy skies. The rains are attributed to a low-pressure system near the Sri Lanka-Tamil Nadu coast, which is forecasted to bring heavy downpours to Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Puducherry until December 14.\nBangalore's Weather Outlook\nThe IMD predicts moderate to heavy rainfall across Urban Bengaluru, Bangalore Rural, and nearby districts such as Chitradurga, Kolar, and Ramanagara. Coastal districts, including Dakshina Kannada and Udupi, are also expected to witness heavy rain. Meanwhile, Bengaluru's temperatures are likely to fluctuate between 18°C and 30°C during this period. Thunderstorms may accompany the rains in certain coastal and interior regions.\nRainfall Predictions for Karnataka and Beyond\nDecember 13\nModerate rainfall is anticipated in parts of Coastal Karnataka, Kodagu, Tumakuru, Chikkamagaluru, Mysuru, Hassan, Mandya, and Chamarajanagar districts.\nLight rain is likely in isolated areas across other districts of South Interior Karnataka.\nDry weather is expected over North Interior Karnataka.\nDecember 14 to 16\nPredominantly dry weather is forecast for Karnataka, with shallow fog or mist expected over North Interior Karnataka during the mornings.\nDecember 17\nHeavy rain is predicted over districts such as Chikkaballapura, Ramanagara, Bangalore Urban, Bangalore Rural, Kolar, and Tumakuru.\nCoastal Karnataka will likely experience moderate rainfall, while light showers could occur in isolated pockets of Koppal, Gadag, Dharwad, Haveri, and Raichur.\nDecember 18\nModerate rain is forecast for many areas in Coastal Karnataka and select parts of Interior Karnataka.\nRegional Rainfall Highlights\nBangalore's Temperature Forecast\nMinimum temperatures are predicted to drop by 2°C over the next two days, stabilizing thereafter.\nThe city will experience a generally cloudy sky through December 14, with light rains likely. Weather experts predict that Bengaluru will experience maximum daytime temperatures reaching approximately 25°C, offering a mild and comfortable climate. Meanwhile, the nighttime minimum temperatures are likely to dip to around 19°C, making the evenings and early mornings pleasantly cool.\nNotable Weather Observations\nSeveral regions in Karnataka, including Dakshina Kannada, Davanagere, Gadag, and Kalaburagi, have been experiencing considerable rainfall over recent days. This increase in precipitation has led to wet conditions across these districts, impacting daily activities and creating a heightened need for weather preparedness among residents.Chikkamagaluru recorded a minimum temperature of 13.4°C, while Belagavi, Bidar, and Vijayapura observed temperature drops of 4-6°C.\nResidents are strongly encouraged to monitor the latest updates and advisories issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to stay informed about evolving weather conditions. During episodes of intense rainfall, taking precautionary measures such as avoiding waterlogged areas, ensuring emergency supplies are ready, and staying indoors when possible is crucial to minimize risks and ensure personal safety.",

    "text": "The European Union’s top court has fined Hungary €200m (£169m) for failing to follow the union’s asylum policies.\nThe court will also issue a penalty of €1m a day until it changes its policy.\nThe European Court of Justice said Budapest was in breach of a 2020 judgement that it had violated EU laws by forcing asylum seekers to travel to Belgrade or Kyiv to apply for a travel permit to enter Hungary.\nHungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, in a post on X, said the fine for “defending the borders of the European Union” was “outrageous and unacceptable” and said, “It seems that illegal migrants are more important to the Brussels bureaucrats than their own European citizens”.\nHungary has taken a hard line on migrants from outside the EU since more than one million people entered the country in 2015, most fleeing war in Syria. The Hungarian government erected border fences and tried to stop many from crossing.\nEU law states that everyone fleeing persecution in their home country has the right to ask for international protection, and cannot be removed to their home if there is a serious risk of death or torture.\nIn a 2017 picture, a Hungarian police officer patrols the border with Serbia, where asylum seekers were detained in shipping containers. In a press release on Thursday, the EU court said Hungary “deliberately” avoided applying EU policy and its failure “constitutes an unprecedented and extremely serious infringement of EU law”.\nThe failure included the country unlawfully detaining people applying for international protection and not respecting their right to remain in Hungary until an appeal on their application was exhausted, the court said.\nThe court said Hungary’s failure to follow EU laws passed responsibility on to other EU countries and undermined solidarity.\nA new EU policy on asylum that aims to speed up the asylum process requires member countries to either take in thousands of migrants from “frontline” nations, such as Italy, Greece and Spain, or provide extra funding or resources instead.\nIn response, Hungary vowed not to take any irregular migrants, regardless of any pact.\nHungary will take over the rotating presidency of the EU on 1 July.",
