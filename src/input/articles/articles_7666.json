    "text": "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency Thursday ahead of a tropical disturbance brewing in the Caribbean.\nThe odds of development continue to increase for the tropical disturbance, dubbed Invest 97L, as it churns closer to the US.\nHowever, the details of its potential impacts on the US remain murky, the FOX Forecast Center said.\nThe system may or may not organize into a tropical depression, perhaps even a tropical storm, late in the weekend or early next week as it slides into the Gulf of Mexico.\nWhere is Invest 97L? According to the NHC, the well-defined tropical wave is producing a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms over Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, the Southeastern Bahamas and the adjacent waters of the southwestern Atlantic and northeastern Caribbean Sea.\n“Development of this system should be slow to occur during the next day or so while it moves west-northwestward over portions of the Greater Antilles,” NHC said in its latest outlook .\n“However, environmental conditions are forecast to be more conducive for development after the wave passes the Greater Antilles, and a tropical depression is likely to form this weekend or early next week over the eastern Gulf of Mexico near the Florida Peninsula.”\nInterests across the Greater Antilles, Bahamas and Florida should continue to monitor the progress of this system, the NHC notes.\nThe disturbance has low but growing odds of developing in the next two days, and now the NHC increased the odds into the “high” category for development within a week.\nFlorida flood threat increases The latest model projections indicate that the storm will move in the general direction of Florida and the eastern Gulf of Mexico, though uncertainty remains.\nHowever, a couple of issues are consistent in the various predictions, says FOX Weather Hurricane Specialist Bryan Norcross.\n“The system will drag a lot of moisture across the Florida peninsula and possibly surrounding states. Flooding rains are possible,” he said.\n“(Second), the system will stall and remain near the northern half of Florida or the nearby areas for a number of days. Areas from the northern Gulf coast to the Carolinas could be affected, and a looping track where the storm impacts the same areas multiple times is not out of the question.”\nSince the storm could develop quickly and close to Florida, there would be little time to prepare.\n“Your prep time is going to be about 24 hours, if that,” said FOX Weather Meteorologist Britta Merwin if the storm does develop near Florida.\n“We could see this pull together when we already have rain moving on land. If this does develop, everything’s going to happen very quickly. So you need to make sure that you’re thinking about that and preparing you and your family for that potential.”\nIf the system strengthens into a tropical storm, it will be named Debby – the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season.\nBut named storm or not, the system is promising heavy rains for Florida, especially the Gulf Coast side.\n“Florida will have heavy rain no matter what happens from this, so you need to at least be prepared for that,” Merwin said.\n“So Saturday, Sunday and Monday, we know we’re going to have heavy rain across Florida, and flooding is a potential.”\nThe post Florida declares state of emergency as tropical disturbance 97L approaches US appeared first on New York Post .",

    "title": "Courts in crisis: Sheriff shortage closes Vancouver courtrooms",
    "text": "Vancouver Provincial Courthouse went into crisis mode June 13 as a sheriff shortage led to closures of five courtrooms. Sources told Glacier Media the courthouse lost five deputies to the Vancouver Law Courts which houses B.C. Supreme Court and the B.C. Court of Appeal so those courts could operate. Meanwhile, Glacier Media learned of three courtroom closures in Port Coquitlam. It was only a week ago that [The Trial Lawyers Association of BC](https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/highlights/bc-trial-lawyers-urge-government-action-on-sheriff-shortage-9030747) called on the provincial government to take action on the ongoing sheriff shortage that has led to courtroom closures and delayed trials. Association president Michael Elliott said the shortage “is a severe issue that directly impacts the administration of justice.” Now, said veteran defence lawyer Leo Fumano, “the wheels of justice have come to a screeching halt today because of the sheriff shortage.” Fumano, who spends much of his time at the Vancouver courthouse, said the closure of courtrooms on two floors of the 222 Main St. courthouse has resulted in the halting of a sexual assault sentencing as well as an extortion case. The sentencing submissions in a case of offering an indignity to a dead body is proceeding because victim family members had come from overseas. “There’s been a shortage of sheriffs in this building for a number of years,” Fumano said. “Retaining sheriffs here seems to be an issue.” He said deputies have been lost to the Surrey police, RCMP and other agencies. In an unattributed statement to Glacier Media, the Ministry of Attorney General said, \"Sheriffs are moved on a daily basis within regions, based a number of factors, to ensure the best allocation of resources. \"There are 34 sheriffs graduating next week with another 20 graduating in early July, which will help alleviate some of the challenges courts are experiencing.\" The ministry said the attorney general is in regular contact with the courts about sheriff resourcing issues. The situation has been ongoing for a year or more with [closures throughout the province](https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/highlights/bc-courtroom-closures-continuing-due-to-sheriff-shortage-7567573) as the government works to recruit and train sheriffs. It was a year ago that a [report to the chief sheriff](https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/highlights/sheriff-shortage-causing-bc-courtroom-closures-trial-delays-7340358) indicated deputies were suffering from burnout and considering leaving the service for other law enforcement positions due to low pay and benefits. The trial lawyers complained to Victoria after delays in two recent major B.C. Supreme Court cases — [a murder case and a murder conspiracy case](https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/highlights/sheriff-shortage-delays-bc-murder-murder-conspiracy-cases-8868234), both on May 27 — left numerous lawyers and prosecutors waiting, and compromised the legal process, said Elliot. Glacier Media has reached out to the courts asking if B.C. Chief Justice Leonard Marchand or B.C. Supreme Court Chief Justice Christopher Hinkson have reached out to the provincial government to deal with the worsening situation. \"The Superior Courts will not be making a statement responding to your inquiry,\" court spokesman Bruce Cohen said. Glacier Media has also reached out to officers of Attorney General Niki Sharma and Premier David Eby. The ministry has previously said intake for sheriff education at the Justice Institute of B.C. has been increased. Sharma has already acknowledged the problems created by the sheriff shortage. The provincial government, she said, is working on it. Sharma’s office said it was looking into the issue while there was no response from Eby’s press secretary Jimmy Smith.",

En matière de pêche, force est de constater que le modèle de gestion actuel ne répond pas à cet enjeu.\nAu contraire, celle-ci est reconnue par l’IPBES, la plateforme intergouvernementale scientifique sur la biodiversité, comme la principale cause de destruction de l’océan. Entre 1974 et 2021, les stocks de poissons exploités selon les principes de durabilité sont passés de 90 % à 62 % dans le monde.\nPire, « beaucoup de produits de la mer commercialisés comme durables ne le sont pas », assènent les auteurs d’un article récent appelant à redéfinir la pêche durable. Publié dans une revue du journal Nature, ce texte est le fruit de deux ans de travaux menés par une trentaine de scientifiques.\nA l’initiative de l’association Bloom, ces chercheurs spécialistes de l’halieutique, de l’écologie marine, de la biodiversité ou encore de l’économie marine ont été réunis pour des séries d’ateliers aboutissant à cette publication, sous la houlette de Callum Roberts, professeur de conservation marine à l’université d’Exeter.\n« Le concept actuel de “pêche durable” utilisé par les gouvernements et les acteurs privés depuis la période d’après-guerre est scientifiquement obsolète », assure-t-il.\nDes impacts sous-estimés\nLes auteurs reviennent ainsi sur les limites de la notion de rendement maximal durable, ou RMD. Cet indicateur désigne la quantité maximum que l’on peut théoriquement prélever dans un stock de poissons sans affecter sa capacité de renouvellement. La gestion au RMD consiste donc à fixer des taux de capture qui permettraient une exploitation durable des ressources. Depuis 2013, l’Europe en a fait un objectif de sa politique commune des pêches.\nLe prélèvement massif de poissons « fourrages », comme les anchois, situés en bas de la chaîne alimentaire, a un effet sur tous les maillons supérieurs\nMais le RMD repose sur une « approche monospécifique » qui ne tient compte ni des impacts de la pêche sur les habitats marins, ni des interactions entre les espèces, ni des rôles écosystémiques de ces dernières. Le prélèvement massif de poissons « fourrages », comme les anchois, situés en bas de la chaîne alimentaire, a ainsi un effet sur tous les maillons supérieurs.\nLe RMD néglige également la question des prises accessoires, c’est-à-dire les espèces pêchées alors qu’elles ne sont pas ciblées, que favorisent certaines techniques.\nEn outre, alors que le RMD est souvent utilisé comme un objectif à atteindre pour maximiser la productivité de la pêche, les chercheurs soulignent la nécessité de tenir compte de l’incertitude engendrée par le contexte d’effondrement de la biodiversité et de changement climatique, cela en fixant des taux d’exploitation moins élevés.\nLes auteurs proposent une série de onze actions pour aboutir à une gestion véritablement durable des ressources, fondées sur deux grands principes : « Pour chaque poisson capturé, la pêche doit minimiser l’impact écologique et maximiser les bénéfices sociétaux. »\nLes chercheurs proposent notamment d’exclure les engins et techniques de pêche générant de grandes quantités de prises accessoires ou détruisant les habitats marins, comme le chalut de fond – dont l’hypothèse d’une interdiction dans certaines zones suscite déjà de fortes oppositions en Europe. Ils invitent également à limiter la taille des bateaux et à interdire la pêche dans les zones les plus vulnérables comme les grands fonds.\nRedistribuer la rente de la pêche\nLeurs propositions visent aussi les aspects humains et sociaux de la pêche. « Pour valoriser au mieux la richesse de la vie marine, les poissons devraient être réservés à la consommation humaine, directe, à l’échelle locale, à travers des circuits courts », écrivent-ils.\nIls pointent la nécessité de revoir les systèmes de gestion de pêche pour garantir une répartition transparente et équitable de ses bénéfices et le respect du droit à la sécurité alimentaire des petits pêcheurs et des peuples autochtones.\n« Il s’agit de savoir si la rente économique de la pêche doit être captée par quelques armateurs ou largement distribuée au profit de l’ensemble de la société avec une petite pêche côtière, avec des emplois en amont et en aval… », résume Didier Gascuel, professeur en écologie marine à l’Institut agro de Rennes-Angers et coauteur de l’article.\nEn Indonésie, les progrès dans la lutte contre la pêche destructrice se sont appuyés sur l’implication des communautés locales\nLes signataires soulignent la nécessité de poursuivre les travaux afin de traduire leurs propositions en fonction des contextes locaux, tout en rappelant que bon nombre de ces mesures sont déjà mises en œuvre ici ou là.\nAinsi, au Canada, la pêche du homard au casier est interdite sur les zones d’alimentation de baleines protégées lorsque ces dernières y sont présentes. En Namibie, les prises accessoires des pêcheurs leur sont facturées. En Indonésie, les progrès dans la lutte contre la pêche destructrice se sont appuyés sur l’implication des communautés locales.\nDe quoi inspirer, peut-être, de nouvelles orientations dans les politiques de gestion des pêches, alors que la France doit accueillir en juin la troisième conférence des Nations unies pour l’océan.",
