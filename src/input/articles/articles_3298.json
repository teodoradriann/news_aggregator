    "text": "La cadena de minoristas, Walmart eliminará de sus estanterías más de 45.000 productos de la marca Great Value al considerar que pueden ser nocivos para la salud, tras conocerse algunas deficiencias en estos artículos comestibles.\nLos productos de Great Value que Walmart decidió sacar del mercado son los rollos de canela Great Value 16.5oz (UPC 078742201160 / Lote # L092525200 269X) y el queso danés Great Value UPC (078742201177 / Lote # L092525200 269X).\nRelacionado 10 secretos de Walmart que debes conocer La decisión de Walmart de retirar más de 45.000 productos los rollos de queso danés Great Value Danish (24,324 cajas) y Great Value Cinnamon Rolls (19,224 paquetes), al contener “trozos de plástico en el producto”, de acuerdo con un comunicado emitido por la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos ( FDA ).\nLa FDA define esta situación como un retiro de clase ll que se explica de la siguiente manera: “una situación en la que el uso o la exposición a un producto infractor puede causar consecuencias adversas para la salud temporales o médicamente reversibles o donde la probabilidad de consecuencias adversas graves para la salud es remota”.\nEn el caso de Great Value Cinnamon Rolls y Great Value Danish , según la FDA; existían partículas extrañas en los alimentos, las cuales pueden ser perjudiciales para la salud, generando intoxicaciones leves o consecuencias graves para quienes las consumas.\nPese al anuncio realizado por la FDA , Walmart no emitió comunicado al respecto y tampoco lo hizo Smucker, quien presuntamente es el fabricante de algunos productos de panadería de la marca Great Value disponible en la cadena minorista.\nNo es la primera vez que se retiran estos productos de la estantería de Walmart , previamente ocurrió en noviembre pasado, cuando la FDA actualizó el evento a un “retiro de Clase ll”, teniendo en cuenta que a menudo el metal es el componente que se encuentra con mayor frecuencia dentro del producto, como consecuencia del proceso de elaboración.\nLa sección de panadería de Walmart se ubica entre uno de sus principales atractivos, sin embargo, algunos de sus clientes posiblemente desconocían que recurren a fabricantes como Smuckers para la realización de algunos de sus productos horneados.",

    "text": "Mid-Ohio Food Collective to open farm in the Hilltop neighborhood WOSU 89.7 NPR News | By Emmet Anderson Published July 5, 2024 at 5:00 AM EDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email\nListen • 4:08\nEmmet Anderson / WOSU Cucumbers growing inside the greenhouse at the Mid-Ohio Farm The Hilltop isn’t the first place you’d expect to find a farm, especially one as innovative as the new Mid-Ohio Farm, which is opening to the public later this year.\nLocated off West Broad Street in the Highland West neighborhood sits a once vacant seven-acre property, owned by the City of Columbus, but leased by the Mid-Ohio Food Collective, the largest hunger relief organization in central Ohio. The group feeds over half a million people a year, but Mike Hochron, the organization's Senior VP of Communications, says the goal isn’t just any food.\n“Where we've really focused as Mid-Ohio Food Collective is on fresh, healthy, nutritious food,” Hochron said. “Those things that when a family goes to the grocery store shopping on a limited, budget is going to be the first things that come out of their shopping cart. And that's fresh fruits and veggies in particular.”\nThat’s where the farming aspect comes into play. Hochron says the freshest, healthiest and most nutritious way to put food on someone's plate is when it's grown close to home.\nBut farming in the middle of the city brings a lot of extra challenges that are unique to the urban setting – limited space, soil quality issues and access to water. That’s why the Mid-Ohio Farm calls itself a “smart farm,” utilizing optimized growing and increased sustainability.\nOutside, the farm has 300 vertical growing towers, which are stacked with five Styrofoam pots on top of one another, each of which can produce up to 25 plants in one-square foot, irrigated through an automated system that waters and fertilizes the plants from the top down. These “verti-grow towers,” as they’re called, were originally made for strawberry fields in Florida and California, but the Mid-Ohio Farm is using them to grow lettuce.\n“So we've got 7,500 heads of lettuce that could potentially come from this small portion of our acreage. It is incredible, the potential in this space,” said Trevor Horn, the farm’s director.\nHorn’s career has taken many turns, from a chef at Disney World in Orlando, to being a teacher in Reynoldsburg, where he created an urban farm on tennis courts and collaborated with the Dept. of Agriculture to develop a curriculum for career tech education, focused on food science and agriculture.\nHorn says the farm’s goal is more than just providing food, it also inspires the community to care more about the food they eat and maybe even inspire them to grow food themselves.\n“Anytime that you're the innovator, you're the one jumping through the hoops to make it a reality. But that's what we need,” said Horn. “In a community, in a city setting, in an urban area, people don't have the resources to fail. How do we make them successful? And fortunately for us, we have the ability to do this. And in this space, this is a prime area for that to be a reality for them.”\nOne of the ways to engage the community is through their demonstration kitchen. Horn says they plan to do cooking demonstrations in person and on their YouTube channel.\n“It's one thing for us to grow tomatoes and cucumbers. But if a kid doesn't like tomatoes, but they love pizza sauce. Now how do we get from tomato off the vine to pizza sauce,” said Horn.\nAnother major draw of the space is the FarmBot. This technology was originally designed by NASA to grow on space stations. It looks like a 3D printer hovering over a raised bed, but it uses technology to plant seeds, add nutrients, water the plants, and make sure crops are healthy.\n“This doesn't help us with yields by any stretch of the imagination, as far as what we're trying to produce here on the farm,” said Horn. “But it could inspire students to start thinking about what ifs and the curiosities around agriculture.”\nInside the greenhouse, the farm has 36 troughs, each equipped with a water channel supplied from a 120-gallon pool replenished weekly. A BlueLab panel manages operations including fertilization, acid wash cycles and calcium nitrate distribution, which helps plants to grow in areas without soil.\nHorn says the farm is still a work in progress, and the official ribbon-cutting ceremony isn’t until Aug. 27, but they have high hopes for what the future of the farm could look like, including a pick-your-own berry section, and some fruit trees.\nHochron says that the hunger levels in the community are at a record level, and the Mid-Ohio Food Cooperative is doing whatever it can. The food grown at the farm goes directly to the Mid-Ohio Food Bank and into the hands of people in need.\n“Here at the farm, people can really come in and get their hands dirty, connected to food in that direct, emotional, visceral sort of way,” said Hochron. “We know that by doing that, we're going to create new pathways for people to not only learn about food and where it comes from, but to learn what it takes to make sure that no one in this community has to go without food.”\n1 of 3 — IMG_5018.jpg VertiGrow Towers at the Mid-Ohio Farm, currently growing heads of lettuce.

    "text": "After its abundant biodiversity has been stewarded by First Nations for thousands of years and it’s been eyed for pristine parkland for a century, parts of an island off B.C.’s Central Coast are closer to being protected forever.\nAt a March 13 ceremony in Victoria, Tula Foundation founders Eric Peterson and Christina Munck announced they would be transferring two parcels, totalling 55 acres, of Calvert Island to the BC Parks Foundation.\nThe land will be incorporated into the island’s Hakai Luxvbalis Conservancy, which is collaboratively managed by the province and the Heiltsuk and Wuikinuxv First Nations.\nThe founders also announced a donation of $92 million to Tula in support of the organization advancing its scientific innovation.\nREAD MORE: B.C. couple gives away last $92M, wants others to pick up the baton\nPeterson called Calvert Island the most iconic place on B.C.’s coast as it features breathtaking beaches and incredible biodiversity. It’s also a sacred place for First Nations, he said, noting inhabitants have gathered on the land for over 10,000 years.\n“It’s not just any piece of real estate, it’s an extraordinary place,” the Tula founder said, highlighting the island’s complex coastlines carved by glaciation and how it sits among a labyrinth of land and sea along the Central Coast.\nThe Tula Foundation has donated two Calvert Island plots of land totalling 55 acres to the BC Parks Foundation. (Courtesy of the Tula Foundation) Those comments were echoed by Andy Day, the BC Parks Foundation’s CEO, as he touted the incredible stretch of beach and ecology that make up the donated plots. With the site also hosting rich old-growth forests, Day said the Calvert lands are emblematic of the province’s ecological bounty.\nSpecies are under threat around the world, Day said, adding 70 per cent of the world’s biodiversity has been lost in the last 50 years. Protecting land in perpetuity though actions like the Calvert donation is among the only ways to address that crisis, he said.\n“Along with First Nations people and the province of British Columbia, we will make sure that it continues to be managed responsibly for all British Columbians to enjoy and for all the species in that area to enjoy,” Day said.\nThe CEO hopes the move inspires people to connect with B.C.’s natural areas and spurs other land donations.\nThe Tula Foundation has donated two Calvert Island plots of land totalling 55 acres to the BC Parks Foundation. The foundation’s CEO Andy Day points to the donated lands during a ceremony in Victoria on March 13. (Courtesy of the Tula Foundation) The gifted plots have had a complex and fought history, Peterson explained. Archaeological findings show signs of human settlement on the island from 13,000 years ago and around 5,000 years back, it hosted industrial-scale shellfish agriculture with clam gardens, processing areas, drying racks and trading sites.\nFirst Nations oral histories recount a settlement known as Luxvbalis that was visited by Captain Vancouver. Luxvbalis was devastated by smallpox epidemic of 1862 and many of the dead were abandoned in one of the island’s bays.\n“There’s many souls from many Nations that have never been properly mourned in this place,” Peterson said.\nThe donated lands were surveyed after the First World War and a group envisioned it as protected parkland around 1925. The sites welcomed gathering and recreation for the next 40 years as they were effectively used as a park, but were then bought after the protections were never made official, Peterson said.\nThe sites were then logged for their cedar giants before they were taken over in the ’90s to host a beach resort. That resort created friction with First Nations, other neighbours and BC Parks as the area was closed off from the public. Those tensions escalated in the 2000s under a new U.S. owner who gated the land.\nSince Tula bought the plots in 2009 and reopened them to the public, Peterson said he’s thrilled by their current partnership with neighbouring First Nations and he hopes to start conversations with them and all levels of government on transferring a third Calvert property.\n“They can be assured now that the future of these two parcels is secured for everyone to enjoy,” Peterson said.\nThe Tula Foundation’s Hakai Institute hosts an ecological observatory on Calvert Island that has opened research opportunities to those like Brian Starzomski.\nHe’s one of the many University of Victoria researchers to study at the facility, and said the chance to work there has been lifechanging for scores of students.\n“The most amazing things would happen at this place,” he said, recounting scientists from diverse disciplines debating the origins of Calvert’s geography while they dined together at the island.\n“So many great research programs and papers came out of these discussions, it’s one of Eric and Christina’s great skills, they bring people together and support them with everything they need to do amazing things.”\nThe Tula Foundation has donated two Calvert Island plots of land totalling 55 acres to the BC Parks Foundation.

    "text": "Descubren restos fósiles de lo que pudo haber sido el reptil marino más grande jamás descubierto\nUna niña de 11 años y su padre encontraron un enorme hueso de lo que fue la mandíbula del animal. El ejemplar, llamado Ichthyotitan severnensis, pudo haber medido más de 25 metros de largo, aunque se necesitan más evidencias para el cálculo exacto.\nEn 2020, cuando Ruby Reynolds tenía 11 años, salió con su padre Justin en una excursión para buscar fósiles en el pueblo de Blue Anchor, junto al estuario del río Severn en Inglaterra. Desde que era pequeña hacían estos recorridos cerca de su casa en Braunton hasta que en aquella ocasión se encontraron con una pieza de hueso fosilizado sobre una piedra.\n«Los dos estábamos entusiasmados porque nunca habíamos encontrado un pedazo de hueso fosilizado tan grande«, dijo Reynolds a\nThe New York Times.\nEste descubrimiento está conectado con el del «cazador de fósiles» Paul de la Salle, quien en 2016 encontró la primera pieza cuando estaba buscando en playas de Somerset (Inglaterra). En aquel momento se contactó con Dean Lomax, paleontólogo de la Universidad de Bristol, y publicaron los hallazgos en\n2018. Allí describen la sospecha de que podría haber pertenecido a una especie de ictiosaurio previamente desconocida.\nNo obstante, los investigadores necesitaban más evidencia para entender cuán grande había sido la criatura. Y el descubrimiento de los Reynolds fue la pieza que faltaba en su rompecabezas. «Estaba muy impresionado, realmente emocionado. Sabía que en ese momento teníamos un segundo gran hueso mandibular de uno de estos ictiosaurios masivos, al igual que el de Paul», declaró Lomax a la\nBBC.\nEl equipo, junto con miembros de la familia Reynolds, continuó buscando fragmentos de la segunda mandíbula. La última pieza se encontró en 2022, descubrimiento que les dio más información para estimar el tamaño del animal.\nAhora han concluido que se trata de una nueva especie de ictiosaurio, a la que han llamado Ichthyotitan severnensis, cuya traducción del latín es «pez lagarto gigante del Severn». Según CNN, el ictiosaurio gigante desapareció debido a una acidificación de los océanos hace 200 millones de años y los ejemplares que sobrevivieron nunca alcanzaron un tamaño tan grande.\nEn el artículo publicado en la\nrevista PLOS One los expertos afirman que los fósiles de ictiosaurios encontrados a partir de 2020 está más completos y mejor conservados. Además, consideran que pudo haber pudo haber medido 25 metros de largo, siendo el reptil marino más grande que haya nadado en los mares. No obstante, según Lomax, se necesita más evidencia, como un cráneo y esqueleto completos, para confirmar el tamaño exacto de la criatura porque hasta ahora solo se han encontrado algunos fragmentos.\n“Fue genial descubrir parte de este gigantesco ictiosaurio. Estoy muy orgullosa de haber participado en un descubrimiento científico como este”, expresó Ruby Reynolds a\nCNN.",

    "text": "En un periodo de sequía marcado por olas de calor sin precedentes, el presidente andaluz, Moreno Bonilla, ha presentado una ley de amnistía para los regadíos en Doñana. Las movilizaciones de miles de personas en Sevilla en defensa de este espacio único y singular no han evitado su exclusión de la Lista Verde de la UICN. La depredación de la agroindustria arropada por la complicidad de administraciones y gobiernos autonómicos ha puesto en jaque otro ecosistema emblemático, ante lo cual [Ecologistas en Acción](https://www.ecoticias.com/medio-ambiente/25-anos-de-ecologistas-en-accion) ha impulsado la campaña ‘El verdadero precio de los alimentos mediterráneos’ para salvar el Mar Menor. Ecologistas en Acción ha denunciado mediante la campaña ‘La UE no es como la pintan’ que esta institución es intrínsecamente insostenible, injusta y antidemocrática, y se ha sumado a las movilizaciones de protesta durante el semestre de Presidencia española del Consejo de la UE. La organización celebra que la UE no sea monolítica y haya oposición de ministras y ministros de algunos países a la propuesta para la desregulación de los organismos modificados genéticamente (OMG). Por otra parte, se han realizado acciones directas para exigir el abandono de los biocombustibles a base de soja y de palma, que generan entre dos y tres veces más emisiones que los combustibles fósiles. Ecologistas en Acción ha promovido diversas campañas Ecologistas en Acción publicó en octubre el informe ‘Nadando en [glifosato](https://www.ecoticias.com/medio-ambiente/130264_glifosato-nefasto-salud-nefasto-medio-ambiente)’, donde se constata que el 34,6 % de las aguas superficiales españolas están contaminadas por glifosato, con niveles superiores a los permitidos por la normativa de calidad ambiental. A pesar de ello, se ha aprobado su uso hasta 2033. La Comisión Europea ha sido incapaz de llegar a un acuerdo y amplía 10 años el uso de este pesticida sin sonrojarse. De poco han servido las advertencias recogidas en el manifiesto ‘La plaga de los plaguicidas’ que Ecologistas en Acción ha publicado junto a la Sociedad Española de Agricultura Ecológica (SEAE), WWF y SEO/BirdLife. En cuanto a la emergencia climática, Ecologistas en Acción ha analizado el acuerdo final de la [COP28](https://www.ecoticias.com/cambio-climatico/que-es-la-cop28) celebrada en Dubái, y lo ha catalogado como insuficiente, decepcionante y plagado de coladeros. Aunque por fin se habla de los combustibles fósiles como origen de la crisis climática, el texto incluye la energía nuclear y falsas soluciones como la captura de carbono. La respuesta de la organización ecologista es remarcar la necesidad de un cambio radical del sistema capitalista dependiente de los fósiles, alejada de las estructuras patriarcales, neocoloniales y extractivistas, para poder alcanzar la justicia climática. Ecologistas en Acción se ha posicionado con las energías renovables, los residuos y la anguila europea Además, este año la organización ha reforzado su posicionamiento sobre [energías renovables](https://www.ecoticias.com/energias-renovables/132335_energias-renovables), elaborado colectivamente, apostando por el decrecimiento y por un despliegue de renovables justo, democrático y que respete la biodiversidad. En materia de energía, Ecologistas en Acción celebra la aprobación del Séptimo Plan de Gestión de [Residuos](https://www.ecoticias.com/residuos-reciclaje/109018_hace-mundo-basura) Nucleares que abandona el Almacén Temporal Centralizado (ATC) en Villar de Cañas (Cuenca), aunque plantea 40 años de negligencia en política de residuos al retrasar las soluciones definitivas a 2073. En temas relativos al medio marino, la [anguila europea](https://www.ecoticias.com/naturaleza/anguila-europea-2024) (una especie al borde de la extinción que se sigue consumiendo en la alta cocina) y el mar Mediterráneo han sido los protagonistas de las negociaciones europeas de pesca para 2024. La organización ha presentado un año más el informe Banderas Negras tras inspeccionar de nuevo 8.000 kilómetros de costa. La protección del medio marino en el litoral andaluz ha sido el eje central a bordo del velero Diosa Maat, que ha finalizado su campaña estival con la identificación de 400 vertederos ilegales a través de su web ‘Stop Vertidos Ilegales’. Además, la organización ha celebrado su décimo aniversario limpiando playas, con la retirada de más de 600 kilos de basura en la convocatoria anual de Clean Up The Sea. De la minería también se ha ocupado Ecologistas en Acción En relación a la minería, la ebullición de proyectos mineros se ha hecho más evidente al coincidir el 25 aniversario de la catástrofe de Doñana con la reapertura de la mina de Aznalcóllar y el nuevo proyecto polimetálico de Cobre Las Cruces. La consecuencia de esta ampliación minera es un vertido tóxico global de 85,52 Hm3 durante 18 años procedente de la mina de Aznalcóllar y de 32,76 Hm3 procedente de Cobre Las Cruces durante 14 años. Ambos con puntos de vertido en la Zona de Especial Conservación de la Red Natura 2000 del Bajo Guadalquivir, afectando también al Parque Nacional de Doñana. Estos son solo algunos ejemplos del absoluto desprecio a los derechos humanos y ambientales que ha motivado a más de 130 organizaciones a manifestar su rechazo ante la Ley Europea de [Materias Primas Críticas](https://www.ecoticias.com/medio-ambiente/durisima-oposicion-a-la-ley-europea-de-materias-primas-criticas). Ecologistas en Acción, la contaminación, la sequía y el cambio climático La contaminación, la sobreexplotación del agua, la sequía y el cambio climático está llevando al límite la situación de deterioro de los ríos y acuíferos, sin que la administración ponga las medidas necesarias para revertirlo. Un ejemplo de la gravedad que está adquiriendo la mala gestión del agua es Catalunya que no sólo ha reducido los caudales ecológicos sino que también pone en riesgo el derecho humano al abastecimiento. Frente a ello, Ecologistas en Acción ha defendido los caudales ecológicos, y ha participado en las cumbres sociales por la sequía y la campaña No en raja de Catalunya para promover una cultura del agua acorde con los derechos humanos. La organización ecologista sigue impulsando, además, nuevos proyectos de renaturalización de tramos urbanos en Extremadura, Canarias, Andalucía y Madrid. Hasta ahora, se han presentado 20 propuestas, algunas ya en marcha, que están dando lugar a la creación de espacios naturales muy valiosos en espacios urbanos de ciudades y pueblos. Ecologistas en Acción y la movilidad sostenible En materia de transportes, la Ley de [Movilidad Sostenible](https://www.ecoticias.com/sostenibilidad/que-es-la-movilidad-sostenible) no ha llegado a aprobarse debido al adelanto electoral, situación que la organización ecologista interpreta como una nueva oportunidad para insistir en la eliminación o reducción de vuelos cortos, una medida que se ha conseguido poner en el centro del debate, además del impuesto al queroseno y la recuperación del ferrocarril convencional. Ecologistas en Acción se ha coordinado con decenas de colectivos para reclamar medidas que reduzcan la contaminación y el espacio que ocupan los coches en las ciudades. También ha colaborado en la organización de cientos de eventos pidiendo Calles Abiertas para la Infancia, colegios sin humos y sin ruidos. Ecologistas en Acción y el transporte El transporte ha sido precisamente el tema central del lema de la Ecomarcha de 2023: ‘Por una movilidad sostenible, social y vertebradora para un planeta más fresco’. La ruta de este año ha recorrido Castilla y León, el sur de Cantabria y Bizkaia, y ha contado con más de un centenar de activistas pedaleando como señal de protesta. Se han denunciado proyectos de minería, macrorrenovables, ganadería industrial y grandes infraestructuras para el transporte. Pero también se han podido conocer y valorar los paisajes esteparios, la montaña palentina, la fauna (grande y pequeña) o la flora que se han encontrado por el camino. IX Congreso Confederal en Zaragoza de Ecologistas en Acción La puesta en valor de la importancia de parajes únicos como las montañas ha sido el tema escogido para la apertura del IX Congreso Confederal en Zaragoza. Ecologistas en Acción de Aragón, la federación anfitriona, expuso las amenazas a las que están expuestos estos espacios en la mesa inaugural del encuentro ‘Montañas y valles en peligro. Voces en acción’. La demencial idea de unir pistas de esquí para destrozar uno de esos parajes únicos como Canal Roya en los Pirineos ha llevado a la organización a intervenir en el Parlamento Europeo junto a la Plataforma en Defensa de las Montañas de Aragón. El año termina con la presentación pública de la Nueva Cultura de la Tierra, un argumentario necesario para poner la vida en el centro. Fue el regalo de cumpleaños que la organización ha puesto a disposición del mundo para celebrar su 25 aniversario, para compartir todo lo aprendido durante un cuarto de siglo en defensa de las personas y del medioambiente. Bajo el lema ‘Retales de luchas, tejiendo futuros’ se han reunido activistas de todo el Estado para seguir fortaleciendo lazos y coordinando las acciones de denuncia ante los atropellos del sistema capitalista. Balance de 2023 para Ecologistas en Acción Los más de 300 casos que se litigan en los tribunales para frenar todo tipo de proyectos social y ambientalmente insostenibles pone de manifiesto la importancia y el valor del trabajo realizado por el movimiento ecologista. Un movimiento cada vez más acosado por las administraciones más reaccionarias. La criminalización de activistas que se está viviendo no tiene justificación y es absolutamente inadmisible. La revolución será ecofeminista o no será. Una convicción que Ecologistas en Acción pone de manifiesto al nombrar el primer trío de Coordinación Confederal conformado únicamente por mujeres. La organización se reafirma como herramienta imprescindible en la defensa de ecosistemas esenciales para la vida humana y no humana a través del trabajo incansable de sus grupos locales. El objetivo de Ecologistas en Acción siempre ha sido, y siempre será, impulsar la transformación ecosocial desde la base, construyendo una organización plural, diversa y horizontal.",

The threat is believed to have been a prank call, officials said.\nThe incident occurred at approximately 3:30 p.m., according to police records. Officers and detectives searched the hospital using a K-9 trained to detect explosives, but no devices were found, OPD Public Information Officer Mark Hammonds told Owensboro Times.\nHammonds said detectives traced the phone number and currently believe the threat was a prank call. No charges have been filed as of early Wednesday afternoon, Hammonds said.\n“Although we believe it was a prank call, we take it seriously, and detectives are working hard to identify the person responsible for making that call,” OPD said in a statement.\nBrian Hamby, director of marketing at OH, said patient care was not affected by the threat.\n“Owensboro Health has policies and procedures in place for this exact situation, and our team followed them. The safety of our team and those we serve is always our top priority. Patient care was never disrupted, and we continued to receive and treat patients throughout the day,” he said. “We appreciate the collaboration with our local police and fire departments to respond to this situation in a timely manner.”",
