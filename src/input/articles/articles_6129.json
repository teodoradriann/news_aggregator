    "title": "Breakthrough Hopes in JonBenét Ramsey Case as Father Pushes for Advanced DNA Testing",
    "text": "Twenty-eight years after the tragic murder of six-year-old JonBenét Ramsey, her father, John Ramsey, believes that advancements in DNA technology could finally solve the infamous cold case. He is set to meet with Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn in January, marking a potential turning point in the decades-long investigation.\nJonBenét Ramsey was found strangled and bludgeoned in the basement of her family's Boulder, Colorado, home on December 26, 1996. Despite extensive investigations, the case remains unsolved, with over 21,000 tips and interviews conducted across 19 states. Ramsey, now 80, has expressed renewed optimism as he plans to sit down with Chief Redfearn and representatives from cutting-edge DNA testing laboratories.\n\"We have requested a meeting with [Boulder Police Department] Chief [Stephen] Redfearn in January. He said yup, absolutely, let's get together,\" Ramsey told Fox News Digital. \" That's an important meeting. We're going to have a representative with us for one of these cutting-edge labs to explain what they can and can't do. \" Ramsey aims to persuade the Boulder Police Department (BPD) to allow independent labs to reexamine existing evidence using advanced genetic genealogy techniques, which have proven effective in solving other cold cases, including the identification of the Golden State Killer in 2018.\nAmong the key evidence are items containing unidentified male DNA, such as material found under JonBenét's fingernails, in her underwear, and on the garrote used to strangle her. Ramsey believes modern technology could generate a comprehensive DNA profile that could be cross-referenced with private genetic databases, significantly expanding the pool of potential matches beyond the FBI's criminal database.\n\"DNA is complicated,\" Ramsey admitted. \"But if we engage one or two of the best labs in the world and still come up empty-handed, then at least we'll know we've done everything possible with today's technology.\"\nThe Boulder Police Department has faced criticism over the years for its handling of the case, including strained relations with the Ramsey family and allegations of mismanagement. However, Chief Redfearn, who assumed his position in September, has expressed a renewed commitment to solving the case. \"The killing of JonBenét was an unspeakable crime, and this tragedy has never left our hearts,\" Redfearn said in a statement. \"This investigation will always be a priority for the Boulder Police Department.\"\nThe case has generated widespread speculation and theories over the years, including unfounded accusations against the Ramsey family, who were eventually cleared through DNA evidence. A recent Netflix documentary, Cold Case: Who Killed JonBenét Ramsey, reignited public interest and prompted a new tip from a woman who claimed her ex-husband was involved. John Ramsey said he followed up on the lead but has not received further communication from the source.\nBPD has worked with federal agencies, including the FBI and the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI), to sort through 2,500 pieces of evidence and approximately 40,000 reports comprising over a million pages. District Attorney Michael Dougherty emphasized the importance of solid evidence in achieving justice. \"Whether it is DNA or other evidence, more is needed to solve this murder,\" Dougherty said.\nThe meeting in January could mark a critical step forward in one of America's most enduring mysteries, potentially bringing closure to a grieving father and answers to a nation captivated by the case for nearly three decades.",

A raccontarlo a OVD-Info è stata la stessa donna.\nLa parrocchiana ha ordinato il sorokoust – così si chiama nella chiesa ortodossa la preghiera in suffragio di un defunto – il 20 febbraio. Due giorni dopo, ha ricevuto una chiamata dalla chiesa. Le veniva chiesto se la persona nominata nel biglietto fosse un credente e se nome e cognome fossero quelli di Alexei Navalny.\nNon è chiaro come il personale della chiesa si sia reso conto che si trattava di Navalny. In questo tipo di richieste ci si limita a segnare solo il nome, in questo caso Alexei. Inoltre, non è chiaro come la chiesa sapesse chi avesse ordinato esattamente il sorokoust: i moduli su cui sono scritti i nomi per la commemorazione non sono numerati e sono presentati in forma anonima.\nSta di fatto che, poco dopo, la donna ha ricevuto una chiamata dalla polizia e le è stato chiesto di presentarsi “per dare spiegazioni”. La polizia e la chiesa non hanno voluto confermare o smentire il racconto della parrocchiana”.",

    "text": "(JNS) A rare volume of the Talmud printed before World War II and found unscathed in a historic Munich beer hall after the Holocaust was given to the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum by the family of President Isaac Herzog. The Pesachim Tractate of the Babylonian Talmud has been in the family’s possession for the last eight decades; it will be permanently displayed at the museum in Jerusalem. The book was discovered amid many other religious artifacts in the Bürgerbräukeller beer hall in Munich in 1945 and was entrusted to Rabbi Yitzhak Halevi Herzog (1888-1959), grandfather of the current president of Israel. The rabbi was the chief Ashkenazic rabbi of Eretz Israel and a prominent religious leader during the pre-state period. The Bürgerbräukeller was where Adolf Hitler launched the Beer Hall Putsch in November 1923, and where he announced the re-establishment of the Nazi Party in February 1925. In 1939, the beer hall was the scene of an attempted assassination of Hitler and other Nazi leaders by Georg Elser. The tractate discusses topics related to Passover and the Passover sacrifice. It was passed from Rabbi Herzog to his son, the sixth president of Israel, Chaim Herzog (1918-1997), and his wife, Aura (1924-2022). The family subsequently decided that Yad Vashem was the proper place for the book’s safekeeping. “The tractate’s journey embodies, in many ways, the story of a family, my family, but above all, it tells the story of a nation and the story of a people,” Herzog said at Yad Vashem on Wednesday. “A people who rose from ashes and built a home. Not just any home, but one with strong roots that run deeper than any disaster, and whose branches, though well-known, continue to grow, bear fruit and climb ever higher. “This is a story of destruction and rebirth; of mourning and rebuilding; of darkness and light; of redemption and freedom,” he added. Yad Vashem Chairman Dani Dayan said, “By including this rare artifact in the Holocaust History Museum we can illuminate the vibrant tapestry of Jewish life in pre-Holocaust Europe and the subsequent horrors. “Its unveiling, just before Jews around the world gather at their Seder tables to recount the Exodus from Egypt and our emergence as a nation, is especially poignant. As we fulfill the timeless commandment to remember the past, we affirm the enduring perseverance of the Jewish people throughout the ages,” Dayan said. To read more content visit www.jns.org",

    "title": "Group alleges Port of Morrow misled Kotek for permission to dump toxic water",
    "text": "A group of 26 conservation nonprofits, grassroots organizations and community leaders have signed a letter sent to Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek alleging the Port of Morrow, located along the Columbia River in northeastern Oregon, intentionally misled the governor about its wastewater storage capacity while seeking an emergency order earlier this year.\nThe Feb. 21 letter, authored by advocacy group Oregon Rural Action and undersigned by a former Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) administrator and a former Morrow County commissioner, among others, requests that the governor rescind an executive order she made in January that allows the Port of Morrow to violate its wastewater permit.\n“We believe this decision was misguided and may have been based on incomplete, misleading, or inaccurate information,” the letter reads. “[The executive order] needlessly allows for increased pollution during the high-risk winter season when the risk to the public is highest, threatening to worsen an already severe crisis.”\nThe letter also requests the governor declare a public health and environmental emergency in the Lower Umatilla Basin due to nitrate pollution in groundwater within the Lower Umatilla Basin Groundwater Management Area.\nA spokesperson for the Office of Governor Kotek told Columbia Insight in an email that her office had received the letter and is reviewing it.\nThe Lower Umatilla Basin Groundwater Management Area, which spans 550 square miles across Morrow and Umatilla counties along the Columbia River, has been plagued with high levels of nitrates in groundwater since the 1990s.\nA report released by Oregon DEQ in January found that nitrate contamination, driven primarily by agricultural practices, has continued to worsen over the past decade.\n“The people who are affected by this pollution, the victims of pollution, are low-income, non-English speaking, disproportionately Latino and immigrants, working class,” Kaleb Lay, director of policy and research at Oregon Rural Action, told Columbia Insight. “They don’t have a lot of power on their own, but that’s why we’re supposed to have regulations and laws—so the polluters can’t get away with this sort of thing.”\nChronic polluter\nThe Port of Morrow, Oregon’s largest industrial port east of Portland, accepts wastewater from industrial businesses such as food processing plants, data centers and a PG&E-owned power plant.\nThe Port then moves that nitrogen-rich wastewater upgradient for land application on agricultural fields.\nSpecific conditions must be met for the land application of wastewater. The Port is only allowed to dump a certain amount of wastewater at a time to agricultural land in order to ensure the nitrates don’t reach groundwater stores.\nLand application during the rainy season is especially tricky, because if the soil is already saturated with water (from, say, a run of rainy weather), the Port must wait until the soil dries before spreading wastewater.\nThe wastewater is stored in lagoons until it can be disposed of.\n“The fundamental problem is the Port has chronically—for years, years and years—produced way more [wastewater] than the fields where they’re allowed to dispose of it can possibly handle, which creates this leaching problem, which leads to permit violations and contaminates the groundwater,” said Lay.\nA 2022 investigation by the Oregon Capital Chronicle found the Port had violated its wastewater permits for the previous 15 years. In the last two years, DEQ has fined the Port more than $3.1 million for permit violations.\nThe Port is in the midst of building out more lagoons to store the wastewater, a move that it hopes will end future winter water dumps on the land. Those lagoons are expected to be completed by November 2025.\nExecutive order suspends rules\nAmid a spell of unusually wet weather in December 2024, the Port of Morrow requested the governor sign an emergency order that would allow it to violate wastewater regulations, arguing that the predicted precipitation and freezing conditions would overwhelm its wastewater storage capacity, thus forcing the Port to exceed its land-application capacity.\nWithout the order, the Port argued, it wouldn’t have any choice but to stop accepting wastewater, because it wouldn’t have any place to legally put it. That decision might have forced the industrial facilities generating wastewater to cease operations, which in turn could have led to “furloughs of potentially thousands of workers resulting in substantial economic harm to the region and the State of Oregon,” according to Gov. Kotek’s subsequent executive order (EO), issued Jan. 13.\nThe EO granted the Port of Morrow’s request and declared a state of emergency “due to risk of economic shutdown” in Morrow and Umatilla counties.\nThe EO allows the Port to apply wastewater only to fields that are down-gradient from domestic wells or those that are designated as low-risk for contamination.\n“I did not make this decision lightly,” Kotek said in a news release. “We must balance protecting thousands of jobs in the region, the national food supply, and domestic well users during this short period of time during an unusually wet winter.”\nKotek’s order allows an exception to the Port of Morrow’s wastewater permit only from Jan. 15 through Feb. 28.\nThe Port of Morrow officially invoked the EO’s use on Feb. 17, nearly a month after the EO was issued.\nPort of Morrow Executive Director Lisa Mittelsdorf told Columbia Insight in an emailed statement that the Port was able to delay invoking the order thanks to conservation efforts and management of its storage-lagoon capacity.\n“The order was invoked in accordance with its terms only when the Port determined that available storage capacity would be exhausted within seven days. As required by the order, the Port restricted land application to two farms with no down-gradient domestic users of alluvial groundwater,” the statement reads.\nWorrying precedent\nOregon Rural Action, however, doesn’t think the Port of Morrow was being honest in its emergency order request.\nIn its letter to Gov. Kotek, the group compared statements and arguments used in the emergency request against the Port of Morrow’s own monthly reports to DEQ.\n“It’s a paper-thin argument that falls apart right away,” said Lay.\nHe said the Port’s DEQ report states its storage capacity was only at 44% at the end of December, with roughly 335 million gallons of capacity available, despite the Port’s claim to the governor’s office that it was running out of storage space.\n“At the same time, they were expecting to produce less wastewater than they had in the previous two months,” said Lay. “So for the remainder of the winter [including January and February] they had more than half their wastewater storage available to them, and were expecting to make less [wastewater in January and February], which would lead one to believe that they could store all of what was left without much trouble at all.\n“It just doesn’t seem like that due diligence was done in the making of this decision to grant them this power.”\nThe EO is set to expire at the end of this week, but “every day counts,” according to Lay.\nAnd concerns persist over the setting of a controversial precedent based on faulty information.\n“The permit conditions exist for a reason. They’re not perfect, but every violation that [occurs] is a violation because [the permit] is trying to prevent contamination of groundwater. Allowing them to violate without holding them accountable is just giving them a free pass to pollute,” said Lay.\nKendra Chamberlain is a freelance journalist based in Eugene, Oregon, covering environment, energy and climate change.
