    "title": "Large European industry suffers 100,000 layoffs due to loss of competitiveness",
    "text": "The competitiveness crisis that impacts German industry spreads throughout the continent. Without the massive layoffs having yet reached Spain, countries like France have already been affected by the adjustments announced in German territory. What began as a blow to a specific business, strongly affected by Chinese competition, is already affecting sectors due to high energy costs and affecting steel, renewables and the aerospace industry.\nAccording to calculations made by elEconomista.es in Europe there are at least twenty collective dismissal procedures in the industry that affect around 130,000 people. Only those with more than 1,000 workers have been selected. And the final amount is practically impossible to calculate because the losses spread like an oil spill throughout the entire production chain.\nThe origin of the crisis seems clear to be located in Germany, with the end of access to Russian gas as the first blow to its competitiveness, which sent energy prices up in addition to straining supply chains, already affected by the crisis. coronavirus. Now, the problems are worsening with the electric vehicle crisis, which does not meet sales expectations, and the arrival of Chinese competition on the continent.\nThus, the country’s manufacturing PMI index was 43.2 in November, far from the barrier of 50, which marks the balance point between growth and recession. In addition, the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said two weeks ago that it expects a 3% drop in production by 2024, which would become the third consecutive year of declines and no signs of improvement for 2025.\nBut the bleeding is not local. The continental PMI fell to 45.2 from 46. The collapse was strongly marked by the weakness of France, whose expected result was 44.6 and marked 43.2.\n“The environment in the sector remains deflationary. Good news for purchasing departments, but it seems that companies are forced to fully pass on price reductions to their customers. This indicates fierce competition, which weighs on margins benefit of companies. We assume that Chinese competition plays an important role,” said a Hamburg Commercial Bank report published at the beginning of the month.\nWith activity and prices falling, both countries are leading the wave of layoffs in the continent’s industry; an underlying trend that has worsened with the start of the school year. The name that has focused the spotlight: Volkswagen and the possible closure of three factories, with the consequent layoff of up to 10,000 people.\nThe general weakness of the continent is added to the automaker by two other factors: the unfulfilled expectations of the electric car and Chinese competition. For example, this November, S&P lowered its expectations for the connected vehicle in Europe and from 27% to 21% its market share forecast for 2025. For 2030, UBS reduced its sales forecast from 9.6 million to 8 .3 million units.\nThe arrival of Chinese brands, such as BYD or Chery, heavily subsidized by the Chinese Government, is another setback for European automobile companies. Asian cars have an average discount of 30% compared to their European counterparts, according to Accenture. The EU’s response has been the imposition of tariffs, although there have already been companies like Cupra that warn that these taxes put their future at risk, since they also produce in the country.\nVolkswagen is followed by Audi, with a planned package of 4,500 layoffs, and Ford, with 4,000 planned dismissals in Europe.\nAnd behind the manufacturers are component brands such as ZF (14,000 layoffs), the Swedish batteries Northvolt (1,600 layoffs) and Bosch (5,500 departures). In total, the German companies in the Fortune 500 index have already announced 60,000 departures – not all of them from the industrial sector. The figure is much higher, since we would have to add Schaeffler with 4,700 casualties, or the trail of small adjustments in companies throughout the chain.\nThe crisis also crossed the Rhine into France, being the second country most affected by layoffs. The auxiliary automobile industry concentrated a good part of the cuts. Forvia, the old Faurecia, for example, has already made public its willingness to shrink its global workforce by 13% with 10,000 departures. They were followed in recent weeks by Valeo, which is negotiating 1,100 cancellations, and Michelin, with another 1,250.\nAway from four wheels, Airbus – with facilities spread across the continent – is also preparing a layoff plan for 2,500 people due to “a complex business environment” marked by challenges such as rising costs and “rapid changes in war.” .\nThe layoffs also impact the British economy. Although the automotive sector bears its share of responsibility due to the closure of the Vauxhall factory in Luton (1,000 layoffs), the largest industry hit by the macroeconomic situation is steel, with 2,500 departures from Tata Steel and up to 2,000 dismissals on the table for part of British Steel.\nThe steel company faces a problem similar to that of the automobile. Added to the high energy costs and environmental restrictions in a context of low demand is the arrival of Chinese production at much lower prices. For this same reason, the German company Thyssenkrupp made public a plan to reduce its workforce by 11,000 people until 2030.\nSpain is free, for the moment, from major adjustments The large EREs are so far concentrated in Germany, France and the United Kingdom. In fact, the Spanish manufacturing PMI stood at 54.5 in October, solidly based on growth. The layoffs have not yet affected the Spanish market, although the union sources consulted by elEconomista.es They admit that they will arrive sooner rather than later.\nIn the country, the cuts of 430 people at Siemens Gamesa (framed within an adjustment of 4,100 people), the ERE for 108 people at Antolin due to the closure of its factory in Navarra and the adjustment for 67 people at Solideo stand out. In the automotive sector, Seat maintains that the Volkswagen crisis will not affect it because it has already reduced its fixed costs by 30% in recent years and Ford’s Almussafes (Valencia) plant is not impacted by the ‘snip’ of 4,000 jobs announced at continental level.\nWhatsApp Twitter Linkedin Beloud\n#Large #European #industry #suffers #layoffs #due #loss #competitiveness",

They are competing in two categories - “Prototype” and “Urban Concept”. The “Prototype” class focuses on maximum efficiency, while the “Urban Concept” class encourages more practical designs.\nThe HAUI AUTO team from Hanoi University of Industry, who were the competition’s runner-up in 2022 and one of the top 5 winners in 2023, have chosen to compete in the Prototype-Internal Combustion Engine segment. Elsewhere, LH-EV Fuel Cell from Lac Hong University are determined to continue their impressive series of achievements in the Urban Concept category - Hydrogen Fuel Cell this year, as the team bagged the championship in this category for five consecutive years between 2015 and 2019.\nThe team from Lac Hong University were also the only local representative to make it to the final round of the Shell Eco-marathon held in London in 2019.\nThe competition aims to encourage students to be creative and apply advanced technology in order toefficiently use power. It also challenges students’ innovativeness and creativeness requiring them to design and construct the most energy efficient vehicle. It therefore seeks to inspire young engineers from around the region to develop new approaches aimed atfueling efficiency.\nVOV",

(NASDAQ: DARE), a leader in women’s health innovation, today announced the publication of data from the postcoital test clinical study of Ovaprene in two original research articles in the journal Contraception.\nPublication Details:\nMauck, et al. “Successful postcoital testing of Ovaprene: An investigational non- hormonal monthly vaginal contraceptive.” Contraception. Vol. 132, April 2024, 110373. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.contraception.2024.110373\nMauck, et al. “Safety Testing of Ovaprene: an Investigational Non-Hormonal Monthly Vaginal Contraceptive.” Contraception. Advance online publication, 110440. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.contraception.2024.110440\n“We are very pleased to have the postcoital test study results for our investigational, hormone-free intravaginal contraceptive Ovaprene published in a leading reproductive health journal,” said Sabrina Martucci Johnson, President and CEO of Daré Bioscience. “Our published results show Ovaprene was safe and prevented essentially all sperm from entering the cervical canal across all women and cycles evaluated without disrupting the vaginal microbiome. PCT studies have been used as surrogate markers for contraceptive effectiveness and, based on comparable PCT studies, Ovaprene is expected to deliver efficacy approaching hormonal methods. The published results were seminal in enabling us to commence the pivotal Phase 3 clinical study of Ovaprene, which is now enrolling across the United States as we continue to advance this innovative candidate for women who want or need a hormone-free contraceptive.”\nThe pivotal study is a single arm, open-label contraceptive efficacy study of Ovaprene® which aims to enroll sufficient participants across approximately 20 study sites in the U.S. to have approximately 250 participants complete approximately 12 months (13 menstrual cycles) of use. Daré plans to provide updates on anticipated timing for study completion as enrollment progresses. If successful, Daré expects the pivotal study to support marketing approvals of Ovaprene in the U.S. and other countries.\nIn July 2021, Daré entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as represented by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to collaborate on the pivotal Phase 3 study of Ovaprene. The agreement gives Daré access to the contraceptive clinical trial expertise of NICHD’s Contraceptive Clinical Trial Network while also sharing the costs of the Phase 3 pivotal study with NICHD.\nIn January 2020, Daré and Bayer announced an exclusive licensing agreement for U.S. commercial rights to Ovaprene. Under the agreement, Daré received an upfront payment and access to Bayer’s extensive clinical and market capabilities while retaining control over Ovaprene’s development and regulatory approval process. Bayer received the right to obtain exclusive rights to commercialize the product in the U.S. following completion of the pivotal clinical trial being undertaken by Daré if Bayer, in its sole discretion, pays Daré $20 million. In addition, Daré may receive from Bayer up to $310 million in commercial milestone payments, plus double-digit, tiered royalties on net sales.\nIf Ovaprene is approved by the FDA, it could be the first monthly hormone-free contraceptive product for women and a first-in-category option for women seeking a hormone-free, self-administered and monthly birth control method.\nAbout Ovaprene®\nOvaprene is an investigational hormone-free, intravaginal monthly product candidate currently in clinical development for pregnancy prevention. Ovaprene releases a locally acting, non-hormonal agent to impede sperm motility and features a proprietary knitted polymer barrier to physically block sperm from entering the cervical canal.\nOvaprene completed a successful postcoital test (PCT) clinical study where, in all women and across all cycles evaluated, it prevented virtually all sperm from entering the cervical canal, a surrogate marker for contraceptive effectiveness.1, 2 The results from the PCT clinical study support continued clinical development of Ovaprene and its potential to be the first FDA-approved hormone-free, monthly contraceptive option for women.\n1 Mauck C, Vincent K.

In this press release, forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements relating to Ovaprene’s potential to be the first FDA-approved hormone-free monthly contraceptive product for women, the expectation that Ovaprene will demonstrate contraceptive efficacy approaching the contraceptive efficacy of hormone-based birth control products in its pivotal clinical study, target enrollment in the pivotal clinical study of Ovaprene, plans to provide updates on anticipated timing for completion of the pivotal clinical study of Ovaprene, Daré’s expectation that the pivotal clinical study of Ovaprene, if successful, would serve as the primary clinical support for future applications for marketing approval in the U.S. and other countries, the potential market opportunity for Ovaprene, if approved, and potential payments from Bayer under the license agreement between Bayer and Daré. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause Daré’s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements in this press release, including, without limitation, risks and uncertainties related to: Daré’s ability to raise additional capital when and as needed to advance its product candidates, execute its business strategy and continue as a going concern; Daré’s ability to develop, obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for, and commercialize its product candidates and to do so on communicated timelines; failure or delay in starting, conducting and completing clinical trials of a product candidate; Daré’s ability to design and conduct successful clinical trials, to enroll a sufficient number of patients, to meet established clinical endpoints, to avoid undesirable side effects and other safety concerns, and to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy of its product candidates; Daré’s dependence on third parties to conduct clinical trials and manufacture and supply clinical trial material and commercial product; the risk that positive findings in early clinical and/or nonclinical studies of a product candidate may not be predictive of success in subsequent clinical and/or nonclinical studies of that candidate; the risk that the FDA, other regulatory authorities, members of the scientific or medical communities or investors may not accept or agree with Daré’s interpretation of or conclusions regarding data from clinical studies of its product candidates; the risk that development of a product candidate requires more clinical or nonclinical studies than Daré anticipates; the loss of, or inability to attract, key personnel; the effects of macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical events, public health emergencies, and major disruptions in government operations on Daré’s operations, financial results and condition, and ability to achieve current plans and objectives; the risk that developments by competitors make Daré’s product or product candidates less competitive or obsolete; difficulties establishing and sustaining relationships with development and/or commercial collaborators; failure of Daré’s product or product candidates, if approved, to gain market acceptance or obtain adequate coverage or reimbursement from third-party payers; Daré’s ability to retain its licensed rights to develop and commercialize a product or product candidate; Daré’s ability to satisfy the monetary obligations and other requirements in connection with its exclusive, in-license agreements covering the critical patents and related intellectual property related to its product and product candidates; Daré’s ability to adequately protect or enforce its, or its licensor’s, intellectual property rights; the lack of patent protection for the active ingredients in certain of Daré’s product candidates which could expose its products to competition from other formulations using the same active ingredients; product liability claims; governmental investigations or actions relating to Daré’s product or product candidates or the business activities of Daré, its commercial collaborators or other third parties on which Daré relies; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation in the United States and internationally; global trends toward health care cost containment; cybersecurity incidents or similar events that compromise Daré’s technology systems or those of third parties on which it relies and/or significantly disrupt Daré’s business; and disputes or other developments concerning Daré’s intellectual property rights. Daré’s forward-looking statements are based upon its current expectations and involve assumptions that may never materialize or may prove to be incorrect. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. For a detailed description of Daré’s risks and uncertainties, you are encouraged to review its documents filed with the SEC including Daré’s recent filings on Form 8-K, Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#2](c2#c-2) Ya, salvo que seas Doña Esperanza Aguirre, o Botella, o M. Rajoy, o Camps, o Barberá... todos impunes ante la justicia.\n[#11](c11#c-11) Aznar, Gonález, ... y el Juancar.\n[#21](c21#c-21) Es un consuelo vergonzoso. Perder su carrera política por incompetencia es lo natural, perderla en lugar de ser juzgados por corrupción es una vergüenza para los ciudadanos.\nY aplica a cualquier cargo electo de cualquier partido politico, que la corrupción quede sin castigo es el efecto llamada a más corrupción y de mayor magnitud.\n#4 7291 dice... Esos son solo los de las residencias, también murió mucha gente debido a la infradotación sistemática de la sanidad madrileña. El índice MoMo en la comunidad de Madrid fue el que más creció de Europa por el COVID.\nDa igual.\nMientras España vaya como un cohete (con Madrid \"aportando\", nos guste o no), a la pájara esta van a seguir votandola los mermados de rigor.\nY cuánto más echada palante vaya por el mundo, justificando la ridiculez de sus actos delictivos, más la jalearán los hooligans de aquél lugar.\n[#1](c1#c-1) ¡Cómo me gustaría decirte que te equivocas!.... pero no... cuanto más macarra sea, cuanto más impune parezca ser, cuanto más vacías sean sus consignas, más fervorosamente irán a votarla.\nLa derecha tradicional es así. No les preguntes por Friedman, Adams o Rand, pero tienen claro que \"los otros\" son el enemigo (las cosas simples funcionan mejor).\n\"Me gusta la fruta!\" ---> \"Qué valor tiene!\" (no tanto, cuando se echó patrás y escurrió el bulto tras su equipo).\n\"Que te vote Txapote\"--->rima... pero justo a este etarra, el PP le abonó su tiempo servido en Francia (2014) ANTES de esta nueva ley.\n\"Es un estado policial\"---> ¿Permitiría un estado policial que un defraudador/delincuente confeso presentase una querella contra el gobierno por calificarle de delincuente confeso?\n[#6](c6#c-6) Los votos negativos imagino que serán los familiares de ayuso...\n[#5](c5#c-5) existen los maseratis diesel? Joer. Como comprarse el jaguar familiar.\nYa estamos cortando y omitiendo las replicas.\nSi otro edita el video cortando y poniendo lo que le venga en gana el titular podría ser otro.\nDiría que al parlamento se va a debatir, no a soltar monólogos. Si quiere presumir de su labor, que no haga cortes interesados.\nComo ella no hizo ni caso, nos lo viene a contar en X. Me recuerda el chiste del que naufraga con Scarlett Johansson y a la larga se lían. El pavo no se queda tranquilo hasta que se lo puede contar a alguien.\nPor otro lado, no entiendo por qué a una se la cargan con un hurto de unas cremas hidratantes y otras tienen prácticamente patente de corso. Temblemos.\nmadrid aportando. Manda cojones.\nMadrid robando. Si madrid deja de robar, otro gallo nos cantaría a todos.\nEsperando me hallo a ver lo que le dice a Errejón\n[#8](c8#c-8) ¿Te parece que se envían pocas noticias de la corrupción de Ábalos? Pues envíalas tu. Si son veraces yo te las voto.\nMientras tanto, dada la cantidad de fans que esta señora tiene, yo le daré bombo a cada noticia que lo denuncie. Por lo menos que los fans tengan que usar la imaginación para auto engañarse.\nY qué recorrido tiene eso?\nConfrontar sin poder real es perder el tiempo.\nEs como si un niño de 5 años regaña a un adulto por cruzar en rojo.\nA ver si aprenden que primero hay que conseguir relevancia mediática para conseguir foco y luego atacar desde ahí.\nCuando ayuso se tira un pedo sale en todos los medios.",
