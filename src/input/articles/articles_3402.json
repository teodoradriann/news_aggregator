    "text": "Primary school shut after ceiling tiles fall\nA primary school in Solihull has been shut with immediate effect after tiles fell from a classroom ceiling.\nParents of children who attend Meriden C of E Primary School have raised safety concerns and question why \"longstanding structural issues\" were not addressed earlier.\nThe local authority school wrote to parents to say the incident in the unoccupied classroom on Tuesday was due to a the building's flat felt roof needing replacement.\nSolihull Metropolitan Borough Council said they are investigating the matter and arrangements have been made for pupils to access outdoor education nearby instead.\nThe school said while it pays into a maintenance package annually, it has no say on how the money is spent by the council who manage it.\nThe single-storey 1960's building is due to have its roof replaced over the summer holidays - which was agreed earlier this year despite deterioration being identified eight years ago.\nAn email to parents, seen by the BBC, said that other areas of the school also require refurbishment due to water ingress, but \"it made no sense\" to carry out the work prior to the roof being fixed.\nIt also said a support prop is in place in a Year 4 classroom due to a rotten support beam - but children have been taught in other areas of the school since it has been identified.\nParents anonymously told the BBC that they were concerned why \"longstanding structural issues\" at the school are taking so long to fix - calling out Solihull Council for the delay.\nThey said: \"This is no longer a matter of inconvenience, it is a crisis of confidence in the council's ability to provide safe, maintained learning environments.\n\"Parents, carers, and members of the local community are increasingly concerned that our children's wellbeing is being compromised due to avoidable neglect.\n\"Our children deserve better.\"\nA Solihull Council spokesperson said it hopes children will return safely to classrooms soon and will keep parents updated.\nThey said: \"Whilst we are currently looking into the circumstances that led to this, our top priority is the welfare and education of the children.\n\"As a result, we have closed the school building to assess the issue.\n\"Arrangements have been made for children to enjoy outdoor education nearby for the rest of this week.\"\nFollow BBC Birmingham on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",

    "text": "Hurricane Milton has come and gone, and the Northern Lights could pop up right on the storm’s heels.\nAccording to the NOAA, a “severe” G4 geomagnetic storm watch is underway, which is forecast to last through Friday.\nRecommended Videos\nDuring this time, there’s a possibility that Aurora Borealis could be seen as far south as Central Florida.\nTypical viewing for geomagnetic storm conditions WHEN WILL THEY HAPPEN?\nUniversity of Alaska researchers predict that geomagnetic activity will be strongest around Thursday evening before gradually dropping off as we approach late Friday. As a result, this will likely be the best time for people in affected areas to see the northern lights.\nNorthern lights forecast Earlier this year, an intense G5 geomagnetic storm caused northern lights to blossom all the way down to South Florida. While the storm this time around isn’t quite as strong, chances remain slim that Central Florida could get another look at them.\nAurora Borealis over Florida in May 2024. Photo credit: Mike Partain near Jupiter (Copyright 2024 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.) CAN I WATCH THEM FROM FLORIDA?\nIf the Aurora were to materialize in Central Florida with the current storm, it would likely be red and very low on the horizon.\nWhile there is no guarantee the Northern Lights will be seen in Central Florida, hopeful sky watchers should allow 15 minutes for their eyes to adjust to the darkness.\nLook north and low on the horizon.\nA planetary K index of 9 is typically needed to catch a glimpse in Florida. As of Thursday afternoon , that value was just below 8.\nClouds will be an issue, especially along the coast, as the the stiff breeze from Milton sends moisture from the Atlantic into the peninsula.\nFuture clouds and rain The best chance for breaks in the clouds will be along and west of I-4.\nWHAT ARE THE AURORA BOREALIS? (NORTHERN LIGHTS)\nThe Aurora Borealis, commonly known as the northern lights, are vibrant dancing ribbons of light that form as a result of electrons colliding with Earth’s upper atmosphere.\nThe solar wind, charged protons and electrons emitted from the sun, first interacts with and significantly disturbs Earth’s magnetic field causing a geomagnetic storm.\nThose particles follow Earth’s magnetic field and enter the Earth’s atmosphere at or around the poles. This is where the magnetic field is at its weakest.\nHow Northern Lights form Those electrons then interact with and excite molecules in Earth’s atmosphere. The excitement of the molecules results in the production of vibrant colors in the sky.\nThe largest geomagnetic storms are caused by a coronal mass ejection (CME) — a large ejection of the sun’s magnetic field and plasma.",

    "text": "O árbitro Rafael Traci, acusado por John Textor de manipulação no confronto entre [Botafogo](/futebol/time/_/id/6086/botafogo) e [Palmeiras](/futebol/time/_/id/2029/palmeiras) no [Brasileirão](/futebol/liga/_/nome/bra.1) de 2023, se pronunciou após [entrar com ação contra o dono da SAF do clube carioca](/futebol/brasileirao/artigo/_/id/13950852/var-botafogo-x-palmeiras-2023-processo-john-textor-pede-minimo-100-mil-danos-morais) e pedir indenização de R$ 100 mil por danos morais. Em rápido contato com a ESPN, Traci, que comandou o VAR naquela partida, disse que as acusações do mandatário \"não têm nenhum fundamento\". \"Ele está tentando manchar a minha imagem e honra\", afirmou. \"Fui atrás dos meus direitos\", completou. O profissional disse que em nenhum momento foi procurado pelo botafoguense. A ESPN teve acesso ao processo movido por Traci. Além da indenização financeira, ele pede que Textor exclua duas postagens feitas nas redes sociais que acusam o VAR de manipulação no confronto e que o norte-americano não mencione seu nome. Os questionamentos de Textor, que tem batido na tecla de uma possível manipulação no futebol brasileiro, são sobre a interferência do VAR no lance de expulsão de Adryelson na 31ª rodada do último Campeonato Brasileiro. Na ocasião, o Botafogo vencia o Palmeiras por 3 a 1 e o zagueiro cometeu falta em Breno Lopes. O árbitro Braulio da Silva Machado mostrou cartão amarelo e foi chamado pelo VAR para rever o lance. Após a revisão, expulsou o botafoguense. O time carioca perdeu por 4 a 3, de virada. Textor usou as redes sociais para mostrar como a suposta interferência teria sido feita. \"Resta uma pergunta ao Sr. Traci: por que a apresentação do vídeo foi manipulada para dar a falsa impressão de posse e controle; e por que o melhor ângulo não foi compartilhado com o árbitro de campo?\", diz um dos trechos da publicação. O que diz a ação aberta por Traci \"Quanto aos vídeos publicados na rede social do réu (John Textor), esse imputa diretamente que houve a manipulação do autor quando da análise da jogada que ensejou a expulsão do jogador do Botafogo, afirma que diante da escolha da imagem feita pelo autor não se mostrou a realidade, que não seria uma jogada para expulsão\", afirmou, por meio do processo, o advogado de Traci. \"Diante da repercussão do caso, bem como o alcance das mídias do réu que possuem mais de duzentos mil seguidores, bem como por se tratar do proprietário de um dos maiores times de futebol profissional do país, sendo um empresário com reconhecimento internacional, tais acusações reverberaram junto a imprensa\", seguiu. \"Deve-se enfatizar que em momento algum fora comprovada qualquer irregularidade quanto a atuação do autor junto ao VAR, não houve qualquer tipo de omissão, tanto que o autor não possui qualquer tipo de representação disciplinar por sua atuação ou mesmo qualquer tipo de condenação\", completou.",

    "text": "2024-08-23 00:37:38\nArmenia is conscientiously involved in negotiations with Azerbaijan, RA Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan stated this in response to a question from a Croatian public television journalist about peace efforts.\nHe noted that Armenia is more than interested in establishing lasting peace in the region.\n“We are sure that this will be beneficial not only for the population of Armenia, but also for the states of the region. However, we see that our constructiveness is sometimes not reflected in the behavior of our neighbors. We have been involved in the negotiations, among others, with the support of the European Union, and currently we see that Azerbaijan, unfortunately, refuses to resume the negotiations on the existing platforms. However, we are interested in continuing the negotiations,” said Mirzoyan.\nAccording to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Armenia does not value so much who contributes to the negotiations, but rather the principles on the basis of which the negotiations should continue.\n“And in this context, I would like to emphasize again that they are territorial integrity, recognition and indivisibility of borders, mutual recognition of sovereignty. These are the principles on the basis of which, I think, an agreement on peace should be reached. Regarding the participation of Croatia or the EU in general, I would like to express our gratitude to Croatia and the EU in the context of border security in our region. I have already mentioned the EU monitoring mission, and I would also like to thank Croatia and the EU member states for their support in 2023. Ararat Mirzoyan stressed, “for the support shown in meeting the urgent needs of refugees who were forced to leave Nagorno-Karabakh as a result of military operations in September.”",

    "text": "The environmental issues generated by industrial advancement and human activities are serious and must not be overlooked. Bio-nanotechnology has emerged as a solution for producing biosynthetic nanomaterials to address environmental issues. The current work describes for the first time an economical and environmentally benign method of producing gold nanoparticles utilizing Grewia asiatica (GAAuNPs). The optimal AuNPs were produced using a gold ion concentration of 1 mM and a metal-to-extract ratio of 1:1. The resulting nanoparticles were analyzed and characterized using X-ray crystallography, FTIR, SEM, EDX, and UV visible spectroscopy. The catalytic methylene blue (MB) dye degradation properties, antibacterial and biofilm inhibition abilities, and antioxidant properties of the synthesized particles were investigated. The Au NPs demonstrated efficient catalytic degradation against MB and completely degraded it in 8 minutes. The NPs also exhibited potent biofilm inhibition against E. coli and S. aureus that was close to the standard and was more antioxidant than the standard. The findings highlight G. asiatica as a suitable, inexpensive biosource for biofabricating GAAuNPs with extensive multifunctional uses. To conclude, GAAuNPs' ability to degrade organic pollutants and eradicate pathogens provides a cost-effective and environmentally benign remedy to tackle contemporary pollutants.",

The evil and wicked people of the world is digging themselves a deeper hole for their punishment. I'm glad Jesus hasn't intervene yet. I want the worst level of punishment for these evil bastards and the only way for that to happen is if more time is given to them to cause more havok and turmoil.\nDon't think it will be just as easy for them to find salvation. We've seen videos of so called Christians who attended church all their lives and still ended up in hell for the smallest sin, if it's hard for Christians to go to heaven how much harder will it be for these wicked evil pos.\nThis goes for the unbeliever as well.

    "text": "Opinião\nExcedente temporário com \"doping\"\nPortugal registou em 2023 um excedente histórico, mas foi graças à inflação que ajudou ao recorde de receitas fiscais. Esse saldo cria a ilusão de haver muito dinheiro no Estado e por isso aumentam as exigências de ganhos salariais por toda a função pública, com os partidos em época eleitoral a concordarem. Já se sabe que isto vai levar a um acréscimo de despesa. No futuro, sem o \"doping\" da inflação, as contas públicas regressarão ao velho normal da pressão financeira e dos défices.\n-\n[Partilhar artigo](#)\n-\n-\n-\n[...](javascript:void(0))\nFernando Medina vai ficar na história com o maior excedente orçamental deste regime democrático. As contas de 2023 ainda não estão fechadas, mas o saldo final apresentado será ainda superior ao estimado.

    "title": "Trabalhadores da Global Media condenam ameaças de insolvência pela administração",
    "text": "Em declarações à Lusa, Augusto Correia, do Sindicato dos Jornalistas e trabalhador do Jornal de Notícias, disse que a gestão já tem feito passar a mensagem de que “mais uma greve e iriam para insolvência”. Segundo o dirigente sindical, as pessoas “não se deixam amedrontar por esta ameaça velada da empresa de que nos responsabiliza por quaisquer efeitos secundários, digamos assim, da sua luta”. Os trabalhadores de várias publicações do GMG estiveram hoje reunidos em plenários, que continuam na sexta-feira, esperando-se depois uma posição conjunta. O GMG informou hoje os trabalhadores de que não tem condições para pagar os salários referentes ao mês de dezembro, sublinhando que a situação financeira é “extremamente grave”. “Apesar dos esforços desenvolvidos ao longo das últimas semanas no sentido de assegurar em tempo útil o processamento dos salários referentes ao mês de dezembro, a Comissão Executiva vê-se obrigada a informar todos os trabalhadores do Global Media Group não existirem, à data de hoje, condições que permitam o pagamento dos salários deste mês”, lê-se numa comunicação interna, a que a Lusa teve acesso. Augusto Correia rejeitou vários dos argumentos que a gestão tem usado para justificar os atrasos nos pagamentos. “Uma das questões que foi colocada é o que aconteceu ao dinheiro que entrou na empresa só no mês de dezembro, por exemplo”, denunciou, referindo que houve “milhões de euros em publicidade em contratos na empresa”. O dirigente sindical recusou ainda que a decisão do Governo em não avançar com a compra da posição na Lusa seja razão para a situação atual, garantido que o montante em causa daria “para dois meses de salários, se tanto”. Augusto Correia disse que o grupo conta com cerca de 550 trabalhadores, todos afetados pelo anúncio de hoje, sobre os salários de dezembro. Num comunicado no final do plenário, a redação do Jornal de Notícias repudiou “a falta de pagamento aos trabalhadores a recibos verdes e a ausência de uma resposta quanto à resolução da situação”, sublinhando “os prejuízos operacionais e a degradação dos conteúdos decorrentes da falta de pagamento aos colaboradores, que deixam a descoberto extensas faixas de território, e aos fornecedores de serviços essenciais ao funcionamento de uma redação (agências noticiosas e suportes digitais, por exemplo) e da atuação da Comissão Executiva”. Exortaram ainda Marco Galinha, presidenye do Conselho de Administração (‘chairman’) do GMG “e os outros acionistas, Kevin Ho e José Soeiro, a pronunciar-se publicamente sobre o estado do grupo, em decadência desde a entrada do World Oportunity Fund” bem como sobre “os danos reputacionais provocados pela atuação dos membros da Comissão Executiva e pelas sucessivas ameaças de falência”. Condenaram ainda a recusa do presidente executivo, José Paulo Fafe, “em ser ouvido na Assembleia da República, argumentando que não quer participar em ‘iniciativas de caráter eleitoral'”. Segundo a redação do periódico, a não concretização do negócio da Lusa foi também por culpa da gestão “que anunciou um despedimento coletivo dias antes de assinar a transação”. O programa de rescisões no GMG, que detém a TSF, Diário de Notícias (DN) e Jornal de Notícias (JN), entre outros, foi prolongado até 10 de janeiro, confirmou, na semana passada, à Lusa fonte oficial da administração. No dia 06 de dezembro, em comunicado interno, a Comissão Executiva da GMG, liderada por José Paulo Fafe, anunciou que iria negociar com caráter de urgência rescisões com 150 a 200 trabalhadores e avançar com uma reestruturação que disse ser necessária para evitar “a mais do que previsível falência do grupo”.",

    "title": "'Eve of Destruction': Barry McGuire's Fiery Protest Anthem",
    "text": "It was 1965: A year in which Malcolm X was assassinated, American combat troops were sent to Vietnam, anti-war protests erupted, and civil rights demonstrators were attacked by Alabama State Troopers. A collective sense of uncertainty and doom hung in the air. But that July, as “Unchained Melody” by The Righteous Brothers and “Do You Believe in Magic” by The Lovin’ Spoonful were rising in the charts, “Eve of Destruction,” a missive written by P.F. Sloan and recorded by Barry McGuire, delivered a jolt of reality to pop music listeners all around the world.\nP.F. Sloan was a session musician and producer at Dunhill Records who had become enamored with folk music. One evening, he wrote five songs in a burst of inspiration. Among them was a grim analysis of the consequences of war and hatred called “Eve of Destruction,” culled from the headlines and rooted in his intensive study of Jewish mysticism. “The song was a divine gift,” he said in 2009. “I was given information about the history of the world through that song – not that that’s unusual in mystical Judaism. It was quite a wonderful gift at age 19 to be given that. I knew it was special and knew it would change things.”\nBarry McGuire happened upon folk music while he was working in construction in the early 1960s. By chance, he’d attended a hootenanny, picked up someone’s guitar, and sang a song one evening. Within months, he was performing in folk clubs. He was asked to join the New Christy Minstrels, a folk music ensemble signed to Columbia Records, beginning his career as a recording and touring artist. But, by 1965, McGuire desired more. As he explained to the New Musical Express, “I left to be myself. I felt there were better things to be said. The Christies have a definite image. I have no image.”\nMcGuire signed with Dunhill Records as a solo artist. Intended to be the b-side of his first single, “Eve” was recorded during his first session for the label in June and debuted on Los Angeles’ KFWB the next day. It quickly became a hit. But the song was also controversial. Billboard complained that the “controversial message lyric…leaves a lot to be desired.” The single was banned by the BBC as well as radio stations in Chicago, Washington, Baltimore, and Memphis who deemed it “leftist propaganda.” Aided by the controversy, the song climbed its way to the #1 spot on the Hot 100 in September. Beyond the charts, a key lyric – “you’re old enough to kill, but not for votin’” – was employed by activists who succeeded in getting the voting age in the United States lowered from 21 to 18.\nThe song’s success, however, proved to be complicated. McGuire recalled in 1974, “It was kind of funny after I released that song. [It was] strictly from the headlines. There was not an original lyric in the song and all of a sudden I’m a subversive and the FBI is checking me out.” He continued recording and in 1968 starred in the original Broadway cast of the groundbreaking rock musical Hair, but by 1970, was having an existential crisis.\nHe converted to Christianity during the Jesus Movement and by 1971, was at the vanguard of the first generation of contemporary Christian music. He performed “Eve of Destruction” at Explo ‘72, remembered as the Christian Woodstock, and earned a Grammy nomination for his 1978 release Cosmic Cowboy. Almost two decades later, he returned to folk and continued to tour internationally until he retired at eighty-five. He said in 2015, “[Eve of Destruction]” is more real now than it was then. There’s more social unrest, there’s more racial tension, there’s more political mistrust. It’s grinding down rather than building up.”",
