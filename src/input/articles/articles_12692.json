    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#7](c7#c-7) Yo creo que suele haber una limitación temporal. Hasta el año 20+/- no puedes disponer de ella de ninguna manera.\n[#9](c9#c-9) Tiene sentido, al final estan subvencionadas o tienen condiciones especiales... deberían ser primera vivienda durante X años o hacer renunciar a ellas.\n[#7](c7#c-7) Alucinarías. De todas maneras en Cantabria las últimas promociones de VPO han sido con unos precios de venta para... MUY privilegiados. Hay viviendas similares en el mercado libre a menor precio, de lo que se intuye el pelotazo multinivel que llevan por detrás y el flaco favor que hacen al mercado inmobiliario ayudando a escalar los precios.\n[#11](c11#c-11) en eso tienes razón.\nLa mía es vpp, y tuvieron problemas porque el precio era muy alto y casi no entraba en el criterio.\nPara optar a ella había que entrar en sorteo y había muchísima gente apuntada que se retiro porque no podía pagar eso o no le resultaba adecuada. Yo la cogí porque ya era mayorcito y no podía estar más en casa de mis padres. Había muchísima gente que quería comprar piso. Pero en mi caso no fue buena compra.\nAl ser vivienda tasada, se supone que no se podía modificar el precio, pero al final lo rebajaron porque si no no las vendían. Eso me hizo perder bastante por la bajada de precio relativa de mi vivienda.\nPor cierto, a ver cuándo me divorcio del banco...\n[#14](c14#c-14) Eso es lo que suele ocurrir. En Santander (afueras) tenemos calles enteras semivacías y con edificios de viviendas abandonados: https://www.google.es/maps/@43.4428094,-3.8503993,3a,19.4y,147.85h,93.9t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sayvuSwTfkSi6WPJyd7qr8A!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDkxMC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D\nPero la solución pasa por dar nuevos pelotazos antes que, por ejemplo, ejercer derechos de tanteo sobre esas viviendas que se acabarán cayendo a cachos:\nhttps://www.eldiarioalerta.com/articulo/santander/primer-sorteo-viviendas-vpo-alisal-sera-5-julio/20240615171859531468.html La marca de la casa\nEl gran problema de éste país con la vivienda es la VPO. Si solo se la conceden a los que pueden comprar y además son pisos más caros que la vivienda libre, si tienen varias plazas de aparcamiento, con piscina.\n¿Como narices van a ser viviendas protegidas?\nSon viviendas para privilegiados pagadas por todos.\n[#15](c15#c-15) la vpo debería ser solo en alquiler, a precios muy bajos y en cuanto se supere el umbral de renta 2 años seguidos abandonarlas para que alguien más necesitado disponga de vivienda\nsi son en venta se la adjudica alguien con ingresos de 14000 anuales pero que a partir de su adjudicación pasan de los 60000 anuales, pero la vivienda ya es suya mientras los necesitados carecen de vivienda",

    "text": "> LONDON, Dec 29 — Misfiring Arsenal spurned the opportunity to reclaim first place in the Premier League as they lost 2-0 to spirited fellow Londoners West Ham United at the Emirates yesterday.\nWest Ham only had three efforts on target but Tomas Soucek gave them a halftime lead before former Arsenal defender Konstantinos Mavropanos extended the advantage after the break.\nArsenal had more than twice as many chances but failed to take any as the visitors defended gamely.\nSecond-placed Arsenal remain on 40 points, two behind Liverpool who beat Burnley 2-0 on Tuesday.\nAdvertisement “This is a very disappointing night for us,” Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta told reporters. “We have to put the ball in (the net) and win it (the game).”\nWest Ham took the lead against the run of play after 13 minutes when Soucek netted after a pull-back from Jarrod Bowen who looked as if he just managed to keep the ball in play.\n“It’s difficult because the ball was in the air,” Bowen told Amazon Prime. “It was hard to tell. It would have been easier to tell if it had been on the ground.”\nAdvertisement Arsenal blitz\nAfter that it was an Arsenal blitz with Bukayo Saka hitting the post and Gabriel Jesus missing two good chances before Mavropanos scored his first league goal for the Hammers with a thumping header from a James Ward-Prowse corner in the 55th.\n“I think the best moment to score my first goal for West Ham and in the Premier League,” said Mavropanos. “We work a lot on the set-pieces, so it was great. It is an important win for everyone and for our boss. We are really happy.”\nWest Ham could have made it three from three chances but Said Benrahma had a penalty saved by David Raya in added time after a foul by former West Ham captain Declan Rice.\nThe defeat raises familiar questions about Arsenal’s title credentials. They led the league this time last year only to falter in the run in and be overtaken by Manchester City.\nIt may have been one of those nights when things just did not happen in front of goal but finishing remains an issue.\nAs well as striking the post, Saka also had a near point-blank header stopped by Alphonse Areola, who made a string of fine saves in the second half too.\nJesus should have a scored when Arsenal were still one goal behind but headed over an open goal while fellow Brazilian Gabriel Martinelli also missed good opportunities.\nThe win leaves West Ham in sixth place on 33 points and marked a landmark night for their manager David Moyes who had never won at Arsenal in the league in 22 attempts. — Reuters",

    "text": "Two relatives of murdered British backpacker Grace Millane have said they are honoured that their work to help abuse victims as a positive legacy in her name has been recognised in the New Year Honours list.\nThe newly graduated university student was strangled to death in a hotel in Auckland, New Zealand, the day before her 22nd birthday on December 1 2018, by Jesse Shane Kempson who she met on Tinder.\nKempson was found guilty by a unanimous verdict in November the following year.\nGrace’s mother Gillian Millane and cousin Hannah O’Callaghan have been honoured (PA) Grace’s mother Gillian Millane and cousin Hannah O’Callaghan, both from Essex, co-founded an organisation in her name called Love Grace, which aims to “empower victims of domestic abuse”.\nThey described their OBEs for services to charitable fundraising and tackling violence against women as an “incredible honour” and dedicated it to Grace, saying she “would have been very proud and keen to get involved with what we are doing”.\nMs O’Callaghan said: “I don’t think she would believe how big Love Grace has become and how many women we can help by offering a bit of normality to.\n“She would have also probably been amused that we have been to Downing Street and are now to meet a member of the Royal Family.”\nLove Grace collects handbags and fills them with toiletries for domestic abuse victims, as well as raising money for White Ribbon charities in the UK and New Zealand, which educate men and boys about attitudes that can contribute to violence against women and girls.\nGrace Millane was murdered (Lucie Blackman Trust/PA) Ms O’Callaghan said: “We wanted to create a legacy in Grace’s memory and directly help women who have been affected by domestic abuse, to turn our negative into a positive.\n“If we help just one woman, then we have achieved that.\n“We have been overwhelmed by the support people have shown our ‘Love Grace Handbag Appeal’, from donating handbags and toiletries, to running appeals in their own area.\n“This has allowed more women to receive a little bit of normality and remind them to believe in themselves as they matter.\n“So thank you to everyone who has donated, and all of our friends & family who have helped us with Love Grace.\n“We would like to accept this award on their behalf and in Grace’s name. We will continue to raise awareness of the issues many face, and make sure that no other family has to go through this.”\nThe handbag appeal started as a practical way for the relatives to try to deal with their grief as “it was very cathartic and allows us to talk about Grace”, Ms O’Callaghan said.\nShe added: “We had no idea how our initiative would take off. It helped that Grace loved a handbag.\n“Detective Inspector Scott Beard (who was part of the murder investigation team) said that each bag was a smile on the face of someone who needs it, so how lovely to think that 16,000 people have smiled because of Grace.\n“We are so proud of the legacy we have created in her memory.”\nThe next step is to try to get charity status for Love Grace, which started with a 50 bag target and is now at 16,000 bags worldwide.\nMs O’Callaghan said: “This will allow us to reach more areas and help offer practical empowerment to more women who need it.\n“Logistics is a key area for development, we rely on volunteers to set up and run appeals and then give back to refuge charities in their local areas. Hopefully we will be able to get our bags further afield.”\nSince Grace was murdered both women have also been fundraising for the White Ribbon charity to help raise awareness of male violence towards women.\nThe body of Ms Millane, who had been on her gap year, was found buried in a suitcase in Waitakere Ranges, a forested area outside the city of Auckland.\nIn February 2020, Kempson was jailed for life with a minimum term of 17 years, with the judge rejecting his argument that the pair had rough sex that went too far.\nHe was later found guilty of raping another British tourist, who he also met on Tinder, eight months before he killed Ms Millane.\nThe rape victim reportedly went to the police after recognising Kempson from media coverage of the death of Ms Millane.\nThe sex offender was also convicted in a separate trial, with a different victim, of threatening to kill, two charges of assault with a weapon, three assaults and two counts of sexual violation.",

    "text": "Customer's photo of forlorn owner in empty restaurant leads business to boom at OK diner Nick Chappell had never been to Spirals Hot Dogs & More before he took a photo of Scott Hosek in his empty restaurant. But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "text": "10 mai, 2024 - 14:37 • Lusa Pelo menos 1,9 milhões de pessoas foram afetadas pelas fortes chuvas que atingem especialmente o estado do Rio Grande do Sul, que provocaram também 114 mortes, anunciaram autoridades brasileiras Segundo o último balanço divulgado pela Defesa Civil do Rio Grande do Sul, 113 pessoas morreram devido às inundações e deslizamentos de terra provocados pelas tempestades no estado. Outra vítima mortal foi registada no estado de Santa Catarina. O balanço anterior apontava para 108 mortos. As autoridades do Rio Grande do Sul contabilizam ainda 146 desaparecidos e 756 feridos nos 435 municípios afetados, que registam também 69,6 mil pessoas em abrigos e pelo menos 337 mil desalojados. Ao todo, segundo as autoridades locais, mais de 70 mil pessoas foram resgatadas nas áreas afetadas, incluindo ainda quase 10 mil animais. O Alto-Comissariado das Nações Unidas para os Refugiados (ACNUR) alertou hoje que as inundações causadas pelas tempestades no sul do Brasil afetaram pelo menos 41 mil refugiados que vivem no Rio Grande do Sul, muitos deles provenientes da Venezuela e do Haiti. \"Muitos venezuelanos e haitianos vivem em áreas afetadas que só podem ser alcançadas por barco\", disse o porta-voz do ACNUR, William Spindler, numa conferência de imprensa em Genebra. Segundo a mesma fonte, o Rio Grande do Sul acolhe mais de 21 mil venezuelanos realocados do estado de Roraima, na fronteira norte do país com a Venezuela e que recebe o maior número de refugiados. Chuvas torrenciais atingem o sul do Brasil desde segunda-feira da semana passada e continuaram nos dias seguintes, causando grandes danos a estradas, pontes, residências e deixando grande parte da população sem luz nem água potável. Com 11 milhões de habitantes, o Rio Grande do Sul tem sido bastante afetado pelas mudanças climáticas. Depois de ser afetado com uma forte seca devido ao fenómeno La Niña, no ano passado a região passou a ser afetada pelo El Niño e registou, em menos de 12 meses, quatro desastres climáticos causados por ciclones extratropicais e tempestades. Em 2023, três desastres naturais ocorreram em junho, setembro e novembro, causando 75 mortos neste estado brasileiro.",

    "text": "SLIDELL, La. — More than two dozen shelter dogs on the Northshore are in warm homes tonight thanks to a community that made sure they were taken care of.\n“All of these kennels were filled with just amazing dogs,” said Holly Marshall, as she pointed out empty kennels at the Slidell Animal Shelter.\nWith the empty kennels, the building is oddly quiet.\n“This is what you want to see. This is what it’s all about,” said Marshall, who is a volunteer with the Animal Assistance League of Slidell.\nMarshall says it all started with a need, before freezing temperatures set in this week.\n“With all of the kennels having that indoor-outdoor access it just lets in so much outside air and when the temperatures are that low it really affects this whole building and it’s hard for any of our heaters to keep up with that,” said Marshall.\nThat meant every shelter dog, about 30 of them, needed to find a foster home quickly.\n“We started putting some posts on Facebook and getting a little bit of traction,” said Marshall.\nDays later, the lobby at the shelter was filled with people wanting to help.\n“On Saturday alone we got 21 dogs into foster care,” said Marshall.\nBy the end of the day, every dog was gone.\n“Since I’ve been volunteering, I’ve never seen the kennel empty, so this is really remarkable especially considering that just a couple of months ago we were over capacity,” said Marshall.\nWith dangerous temperatures expected, the Louisiana SPCA recommends bringing dogs inside. If they must be outside, make sure they’re guarded from any wind or rain and have plenty of warm blankets.\n“A lot of people think that their fur provides them enough protection, but that’s not always the case,” said communications specialist with the Louisiana SPCA Britlyn Pham. “With our shorter haired animals, or older pets, or puppies, you want to give them the opportunity to have extra insulation.”\nSince dogs can get hypothermia and frostbite, the Louisiana SPCA recommends monitoring their behavior as well.\n“Dash has been with us well over a year now,” said Marshall as she pointed to his empty kennel.\nMarshall is overjoyed at the kindness of strangers and says the shelter pups can be returned at the end of the week. However, some pups won’t be going back.\n“People are already messaging our group saying, ‘Oh, we can’t let him go. We’re going to come in as soon as the weather passes and finalize an adoption,’” said Marshall.\nIf you’re interested in fostering or adopting any of the dogs or cats at the Slidell Animal Shelter you can give them a call or visit their website by clicking\nhere.\n► Get breaking news from your neighborhood delivered directly to you by downloading the new FREE WWL-TV News app now in the\nIOS App Store or Google Play.",
