    "text": "By Pat Loeb ,\n1 hour ago\nNORTH PHILADELPHIA (KYW Newsradio) — Members of the Kennedy family joined President Joe Biden at the Martin Luther King Jr. Recreation Center in North Philadelphia on Thursday to announce their endorsement of him for a second term in the White House.\nThe president was also in North Philly to visit a campaign phone bank at the rec center, and said Pennsylvania was his ticket to the White House.\nKerry Kennedy spoke for the family in the gym of the rec center to the cheers of about 200 invited guests. She talked about Biden’s record, but also the values she said he shared with her father, Robert Kennedy and uncle, 35th U.S. President John F. Kennedy.\n“That’s why nearly every single grandchild of Joe and Rose Kennedy supports Joe Biden,” said Kennedy.\nIn total, 15 members of the Kennedy family joined Biden in North Philly on Thursday for the endorsement announcement. The president beamed alongside the members that joined him on stage and called the endorsement an “incredible honor.”\nHe also spoke of how Robert Kennedy inspired his own path into public service.\n“I’ve done so in large part because I thought it was something your dad would have done,” he told Kerry. “He’s always been on my mind, been one of my heroes.”\nThe notable exception from the ceremony was Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running for president as an independent. His run could take votes from Biden and provide a path to the White House for his Republican challenger.\nNeither Biden nor Kerry Kennedy addressed RFK Jr. in their remarks.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Bitter temperatures are forecast to hit swathes of the U.S. this weekend, with the National Weather Service predicting that the cold snap could last well into January.\nWhy It Matters\nSubfreezing temperatures are expected to affect the majority of Americans throughout Saturday and into the following week, particularly in the Midwest, Heartlands and Northeastern regions.\nStrong winds, sleet, ice and heavy snow are also expected in some areas, including some Southern states, later in the weekend, which could lead to perilous conditions.\nWhat To Know\nThe polar vortex—the area of cold air that circulates around the Arctic—is forecast to expand this weekend, bringing dangerously cold weather with it. Temperature forecast maps from multiple sources show freezing conditions throughout the weekend.\nAccording to NWS predictions, the coldest temperatures will be experienced across North Dakota, Minnesota and Montana, where there could be cold snaps of up to -4 degrees Fahrenheit in some areas on Friday, particularly along the U.S.-Canada border, with wind chills as cold as -29 degrees. Maps by Pivotal Weather show that temperatures could drop as low as -21 degrees in North Dakota on Saturday.\nThe same map shows below-freezing temperatures are expected all the way from Washington (30 degrees), down through Nevada (20 degrees), across the plains to Virginia (17 degrees), up through New York (21degrees) to Maine (15 degrees) on Saturday morning. There is little prospect of temperatures improving much throughout the day.\nSimilar temperatures are expected for Sunday, with a low of -12 degrees expected along the North Dakota-Minnesota border as of 7 a.m. ET. Cold weather is also expected to travel further southward into New Mexico, Texas and Louisiana, with between 17 degrees and 37 degrees forecast for Sunday morning.\nWhat People Are Saying\nAccuWeather chief on-air meteorologist Bernie Rayno said in an email to Newsweek: “This is the first snow and ice storm of 2025, and we could see widespread impacts. This storm will be far enough south to cause major problems in cities that may struggle to deal with wintry weather and ice. Arctic air will surge southward in the wake of this storm with subfreezing temperatures for millions of people.”\nWeather Prediction Center meteorologist Scott Kleebauer told The New York Times: “This has the potential to be a fairly significant Arctic outbreak. The one thing for sure is that it’s going to get cold, and it’s going to last a fairly long period of time.”\nThe National Weather Service said in its January 3 short-range discussion: “Areas in the Central Plains and Central Mississippi Valley, especially along and north of Interstate 70, are likely to experience heavy snowfall, with a high chance (60-90 percent) of at least 6 inches of snow from late Saturday into Sunday. Significant sleet and freezing rain are anticipated from eastern Kansas and the Ozarks extending eastward to the Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys, also on Saturday into Sunday.”\nWhat Happens Next\nTemperature maps from multiple sources show freezing temperatures throughout the weekend and into next week. Looking further ahead, the NWS has forecast that temperatures will rise in the west from January 10 onward. An average climate is expected in the Great Plains, but lower than normal readings are anticipated for much of the Midwest, East and South up to January 16.\nThe post Polar Vortex Maps Show How Far Temperatures Could Plunge in Each State appeared first on Newsweek.",

    "text": "- By [Vivek Raj](https://english.jagran.com/authors/vivek-raj) - Published: Fri, 29 Dec 2023 03:18 PM (IST) - Source:PTI The Save Sharda Committee (SSC) on Friday sought the help of the Indian government to remove the \"encroachment by the Pakistan Army\" on the Sharda temple premises in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (POK), in order to pave way for its restoration. Addressing a press conference at Press Club of Bangalore, SSC founder Ravinder Pandita alleged that the Pakistan army had encroached upon the dilapidated old Sharda temple premises and opened a coffee home there despite a court order in the committee's favour. “Save Sharda Committee requests the Government of India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi to raise the issue of encroachments and removal of a coffee home recently erected on Sharda Peeth premises by the Pakistan army. This is despite the Supreme Court of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir's landmark judgment on January 3, 2023 pronounced in favour of Save Sharda Committee based on its representation seeking to stop encroachments,” he said.

Pandita demanded that Sharda Peeth be reopened for devotees to go on pilgrimage. \"We will give a call for a march to the LoC and cross it if the coffee home is not removed by Pakistan authorities and its army. All Sharda supporters should be ready for this march in the near future,\" he said.

The SSC founder told reporters that a website has been launched with the aim of providing complete information and a travel guide for pilgrims and tourists on the newly reconstructed Sharda temple at Teetwal and a Sikh gurudwara that stood at the same place before 1947 but was burnt down in tribal raids. The construction of the new Sharda Yatra Temple at Teetwal in Kashmir, which was virtually inaugurated on March 22 by Union Home Minister Amit Shah, was supported by the Dakshinamnaya Sringeri Mutt in Karnataka. Teetwal, where the temple has been built now, was the historic base camp for devotees who would go to Goddess Sharda's shrine before partition, according to reports.
