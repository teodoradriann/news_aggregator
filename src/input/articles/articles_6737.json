    "text": "Top New York City Police Department officials slammed Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on Thursday for demonizing law enforcement’s response to anti-Semitic protests on Columbia University’s campus. Ocasio-Cortez [responded](https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1783224425074086256) to a video posted on X that showed NYPD counterterrorism officers on campus who were there to ensure that the far-left extremists did not become violent. “Not only did Columbia make the horrific decision to mobilize NYPD on their own students, but the units called in have some of the most violent reputations on the force,” she claimed. “NYPD had promised the city they wouldn’t deploy SRG [Strategic Response Group] to protests.” “So why are these counterterror units here?” she asked. NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell fired back at AOC: “Truly amazing! Columbia decided to hold its students accountable to the laws of the school. They are seeing the consequences of their actions. Something these kids were most likely never taught. Good SAT scores and self-entitlement do not supersede the law. I am sure you would agree that we have to teach them these valuable life skills.” “Secondly, I was with those ‘units’ last Thursday that you describe as having, ‘the most violent reputations.’ These ‘units’ removed students with great care and professionalism, not a single incident was reported,” he continued. “The only incidents that day on campus were the student’s hateful anti-Semitic speech and vile language towards our cops. I am sure you agree any hateful speech is unacceptable. You should rethink your comments to a simple thank you to the NYPD and hate has no place in our society.” Chell said that AOC should visit the campus and “listen to their remarks of pure hatred.” “I will ensure those ‘units’ will protect you as they do for all NYers 24/7/365,” he added. “Lack of accountability = consequences. Hate from anyone, anywhere has no place in our city and country.” NYPD Deputy Commissioner Kaz Daughtry also responded to AOC’s remarks on X: “Everyone has a Constitutional right to protest, it’s one of the pillars our great democracy is built on. But kids also have a right to go to school without being harassed, threatened, intimidated or assaulted.” “There is nothing ‘horrific’ about protecting the safety of Columbia’s young students who are just trying to go to school,” he continued. “We’ve said it time and time again, the NYPD will always protect and defend your right to protest but just because you hold a sign while you’re threatening, harassing, intimidating and assaulting people doesn’t give you a free pass from criminal conduct.” [CLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP](https://onelink.to/dwapp) “Being anti-Semitic and spewing hate to kids will never ever be tolerated in our city,” he added. “Our officers are the best and most highly trained law enforcement professionals in the world. Everyday, they have to endure insults, threats, and hate speech merely because the uniform they wear as they try to keep the peace and protect everyone’s rights. I encourage you @AOC to visit Columbia and do a walk through; I promise our officers will, like always, do their job, and protect you like they have protected everyone on campus regardless of what your political beliefs are. We’ll also take a report if you feel threatened.” Everyone has a Constitutional right to protest, it’s one of the pillars our great democracy is built on. But kids also have a right to go to school without being harassed, threatened, intimidated or assaulted. There is nothing “horrific” about protecting the safety of Columbia’s… [https://t.co/a3fEQQEIeh] — NYPD Deputy Commissioner, Operations Kaz Daughtry (@NYPDDaughtry) [April 25, 2024]",

    "text": "新华社客户端广州7月23日电（记者 黄浩苑）原创新编粤剧《最是女儿香》又把人们对粤剧的认识刷新到一个全新的高度：原来粤剧还能这样！当谢幕时看到一众演员邀请导演、粤剧改编、唱腔设计、作曲与配器、舞美设计、服装设计、多媒体设计、形体设计、造型设计等主创人员一并上台时，观众们不禁感慨：好年轻啊！\n　　到底是个什么样的新编粤剧？\n　　《最是女儿香》7月16日在广州大剧院首演，该剧是粤剧界年度焦点之作。故事以国家级非遗莞香为媒，以寻香为线，串联起一世世的合离聚散，穿透秦、汉、唐、宋、民国和当代，突破了才子佳人间的爱情局限，融入了驱除鞑虏、马嵬坡动乱、名士布道等历史事件，在人生际遇与时代使命碰撞交织中引人深思。\n　　受访者供图\n　　粤剧是岭南文化的瑰宝和世界级非遗，但粤剧的创新面临诸多难点。首先，粤剧的表演有一套独特的“范式”。如“自报家门”的念白、“哭相思”的悲情唱腔、武戏的“翻打”套路等，有固定的情感指向和结构逻辑，编剧需在这些框架内设计剧情。\n　　其次，粤剧有严格的韵律规范。粤语有九声六调，这就要求粤剧的唱词不仅需符合平仄规律，而且要与曲牌旋律严丝合缝，字数、声调都要匹配音符。例如“梆子”“二黄”等曲牌，每个乐句的字数、停顿都有规则，多一字或少一字都会破坏节奏。\n　　受访者供图\n　　管中窥豹，粤剧创新之难让过去一段时间以来，粤剧在几个经典老剧目中反复，难以再吸引新的观众，尤其是青年群体。但是《最是女儿香》努力从各方面打破窠臼，以史诗音乐剧的形式重现粤剧华彩。每段剧目侧重展现的冲突、文武场的配合、曲牌的运用都有巧妙的安排，个像和群像的演绎各领风骚。130分钟的时间里，观众们的掌声绵延不断。\n　　《最是女儿香》运用的多媒体、服装、造型，乃至说唱编排都精准“踩”在年轻人的审美上。剧中的彩蛋也令人十分惊喜。在香树精灵和四小鬼恳切哀求执掌轮回的判官给爱侣机会轮回重逢，判官左右为难。香树精灵灵机一闪说：“有乐队”。威武的判官清了清嗓子，小心翼翼地问：“锣鼓师傅，可以吗？”这个反差可萌坏了现场观众，没想到平时一直坐在下面的锣鼓乐师，也被编排了进来。\n　　受访者供图\n　　创新成了惊喜。一众粤剧演员在《东山少爷西关小姐》的rap中跳起现代舞；台下的一众乐队老师扮演游行的群众举起了横幅，使劲挥舞着小旗帜；重现粤剧经典《帝女花》时乐队老师纠正说：“大姑，那时还没有《帝女花》呢！”……这些奇思妙想都让观众会心大笑，掌声雷鸣！\n　　传统文化创造性转化、创新性发展在这个原创粤剧中得到了充分展现。剧中女主角的扮演者，国家级非遗代表性传承人、一级演员、文华表演奖获得者、中国戏剧梅花奖获得者曾小敏说，他们会用“十年磨一剑”的精神，将《最是女儿香》长久打磨，成为经典。\n　　受访者供图\n　　古老的粤剧正在用青春的表达重新演绎地方戏剧艺术的魅力。“我希望粤剧《最是女儿香》能够吸引更多观众，尤其是年轻观众群体，走进剧场感受粤剧的当代魅力，并借此更深入地了解中国文化。同时，我也期待，粤剧之美与莞香的千年芬芳交融共生，让岭南文化在更广阔的天地中传承发展，焕发新的生机。”曾小敏说。\n【纠错】",

    "title": "Warm weather wreaks havoc on some B.C. ski hills as lack of snow leaves trails barren",
    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open. Fewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions. Warmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan. In Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas. On Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain. Warm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each. Mount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow. James Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season. \"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said. \"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\" Apex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls. Shalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow. \"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\" At Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open. Several resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit. \"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled. Environment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland. Proctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\" He said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior. But Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations. \"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.

    "text": "Mahjoub Mahjoubi was an imam in the small southern town of Bagnols-sur-Cèze\nFrance has expelled a “radical” imam who made “unacceptable remarks” about the country’s flag, Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin has said.\nMahjoub Mahjoubi appeared to call the French flag “satanic” in a video that went viral online earlier this week.\nMr Darmanin said France’s immigration reforms had enabled the swift deportation of the imam.\nBut the imam denies any wrongdoing and said he had not meant to be disrespectful.\nMahjoub Mahjoubi, who hails from Tunisia but came to France 38 years ago, was an imam at the Ettaouba mosque in the small town of Bagnols-sur-Cèze, in the south of France.\nHe was arrested earlier this week after a video circulated online showing him describing a “tricolour flag” as “satanic” and saying it has “no value with Allah”.\nAlthough he did not refer to a specific flag, many of the comments under the video assumed he meant the French flag.\nThe imam said later he was sorry if he had caused any offence, arguing that his remarks about the flag were a “slip of the tongue”.\nOn Thursday, Mr Darmanin wrote on X that he had asked for an expulsion order to be issued for Mahjoub Mahjoubi, and praised tough new immigration laws that makes it easier for France to deport foreign residents.\n“Without the immigration law, this would not have been possible. Firmness is the rule”, the interior minister wrote.\nFrench media published some of the expulsion order, which said the imam had promoted a “retrograde, intolerant, and violent image of Islam, likely to encourage behaviour contrary to the values of the Republic”.\nIt said his teachings encouraged discrimination against women, “tensions with the Jewish community” and “jihadist radicalisation”. According to the order, he had also referred to Jewish people as “the enemy”.\nHe was expelled “less than 12 hours after his arrest”, Mr Darmanin said in another post, adding that the new laws “makes France stronger”.\n“We won’t let anything go,” he warned.\nFrance’s immigration reforms have reduced protections for foreign residents and made it easier for them to be deported if they get a criminal conviction or are deemed to be a “grave threat to public order”.\nFrench media reported that Mahjoub Mahjoubi had boarded a flight back to Tunisia on Thursday evening.\nHis lawyer said they would appeal his deportation.",

Entérate quién financio al valeroso pueblo de Afganistán y sus valerosos guerreros los muyahidines( les dedicaron Rambo iii y todo), o quien armó y financio a Irak, a estos que ves ahora este terrible atentado de la noticia, quien los organizo y financió, ... Después nos vuelves a contar estás cosas. Y si sigues pensando que está irán detrás de todo pq es omnipresente vale. Si ves q algún otro estado puede estar implicado, fijate quién lo arma y financia. Un saludo.\n[#13](c13#c-13) lo se y lo he criticado 100 millones de veces, dinero de EEUU y Arabia Saudita y Pakistán.\nPero eso no les importa para llamarlos partisanos, \"que en Europa les habría llamado partisanos y que habrían luchado contra los nazis\"\nEso es mierda, el fanatismo religioso no atiende a razones.\nAl menos tu comentario muestra algo de vergüenza de esa gente... Algo es algo.\n[#20](c20#c-20) pues mira otra vez la captura que mandas, pq es exactamente lo que estoy diciendo. Afganistán era un país más adelantado que España y las mujeres iban sin velo. El tío Sam puso a la derecha religiosa conservadora, o lo que viene a ser los fascistas de toda la vida, pero en musulmán, a levantarse en armas... Cómo en Irak, libia, Egipto, Ucrania... Mismo proceder en todos lados, mismo resultado en todos lados. Países de mierda con gobiernos autoritarios y la población paupérrima y reprimida. Eso es el tío Sam.\n[#30](c30#c-30) Claro, Afganistan era un paraiso...\nhttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerra_de_Afganist%C3%A1n_(1978-1992))\nTienes una vision de la historia bastante distorsionada. China tambien dio armas a los talibanes para luchar contra la URSS, entre otros tantos paises....\nClaaaaaaro, todo culpa del tio sam...\n[#31](c31#c-31) entérate lo que era Afganistán antes del 92.\nEra un estado laico. En el año 90 la mayoría del profesorado eran mujeres, por ejemplo, que estaba integrada en el mundo laboral.\nY la revolución hostigada por el tío Sam puso a los integristas islámicos. Los valerosos muyahidines, como dijeron en Rambo 3, que les dedicaron.\nInfórmate tú un poquito, antes de hablar sin saber.\n[#0](c0#c-0) Ese titular es tendencioso y confuso, y probablemente seas consciente. El ataque no fue durante una misa, como quiere dar a entender, si no que se atacó una serie de aldeas de manera coordinada. Y además, el factor religioso no es el único relevante, y tampoco está plenamente confirmado.\nHay fuentes mucho más serias, informadas y rigurosas que la que has mandado...\n[#10](c10#c-10) Resulta difícil creer que puedan existir fuentes más serias leyendo maravillas cosas como:\nLa reciente matanza sucedida en Navidad confirma lo que anuncian las estadísticas: el cristianismo es la religión más perseguida en el mundo. Y no se limita solamente a esta región de África, sino que ocurre en Asia y Medio Oriente. Hace poco a cristianos perseguidos por el régimen comunista chino se les negó asilo en la España de Pedro Sánchez y el PSOE. Solo una lo pudo obtener porque su salud le impedía subir al avión donde la deportaban.\nTodo ello, mientras las pateras siguen llegando a España, posiblemente con insurgentes tan radicales como los que masacran a los cristianos en Nigeria y sin el amparo para los cristianos que huyen de estos.\nMira, igual en que en Gaza, pero estos no lo llaman masacre.\nhttps://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20231217/9456963/iglesia-denuncia-israel-mato-sangre-fria-dos-feligresas-gaza.html\nhttps://es.zenit.org/2023/12/12/22-cristianos-muertos-en-gaza-cohete-sin-detonar-hallado-en-parroquia/\n[#14](c14#c-14) Yo no apoyo yihadistas, eso es Israel que apoya a DAESH\nYo soy de izquierdas, no apoyo a la extrema derecha\nNo es muy dificil de entender, ánimo\n[#18](c18#c-18) otro comentario más de \"la culpa es de todos menos de la yihad y los países de mierda donde reina la sharia\"\nHoy te estás coronado máquina.\nQue lastima que estes aquí criticando a occidente para tapar mierdas de asesinos fanatizados y no allí al revés como los verdaderos mártires que si luchan por denunciar atrocidades de países islámicos, ahí veríamos lo valiente que eres con tu reinvidicacion de sofa y tu bandera nazi con la israelí en la foto de perfil.\n[#25](c25#c-25) Financiasteis a los talibanes para combatir a los rusos y ahora estamos pagando los platos\nFinanciar ISIS para destruir oriente medio\nFinanciar siempre lo peor para seguir con los genocidios, apartheid, limpieza étnica...\n[#26](c26#c-26) \"Financiasteis a los talibanes\"\nyo no financie a nadie, manipulador de pacotilla. Típico de esos de la bandera de tu perfil.\nMuestras muchos decíamos que la primavera árabe está plagado de fanáticos religiosos que apoyaban las reveliones, tantos otros decían que \"callate, hacen lo que deberíamos estar haciendo en Europa, es una revolución\". Ahora a gente como tú, si tu, que estás criticando a los críticos con el yihadismo de hamas se le avisa que apoyar grupos terroristas que hacen matanzas públicas es una barbaridad y que esto les embalentona y atrae a más fanáticos y que será la perdición de Palestina no escucháis. Dentro de 10 años saldrán muchos de Europa que han visto gritos de Allahu adbak y tontos en Internet diciendo que el único error de hamas es no haber actuado antes... Luego habrán chavales que pensarán que están siendo héroes en un Isis o unos talibanes dando su vida por puercos que vienen a cuerpo de rey con 4 mujeres y esclavas sexuales.\n[#9](c9#c-9) ¿En qué parte de su comentario dice eso? \"no son culpables de sus actos\" y toda la mierda que sigue. O qué parte de su comentario te ha llevado a esa conclusión, si es que necesitas algo más de margen.\nAunque es posible que esa respuesta no tenga nada que ver con su comentario y simplemente sea una patética y lamentable pataleta porque no te ha gustado su respuesta.\n[#17](c17#c-17) \"por no sé que historia\".\n¿O por \"no quiero saber\"? Te dan la oportunidad de aprender, no la desperdicies.\n[#19](c19#c-19) tienes algún comentario de crítica o de repudio a esta atrocidad? O vienes aquí a adoctrinar me sobre lo malo que es eeuu?\nEs una noticia de 160 muertos a manos de yihadistas por ser infieles.\nEntre tu y yo? Es duro entrar aquí a un noticia tan trágica y ponerte a discutir sobre si la culpa es o no es de occidente o ya estás curado de eso?\nEntras aquí a recalcar que \"no quiero saber\" tu verdad... Que ascazo.\n[#21](c21#c-21) Eres tú quien ha introducido este tema. Igual esperabas otro tipo de respuestas y ahora te arrepientes de haberte puesto a chapotear con intención de salpicar a los demás.\n[#23](c23#c-23) en todo momento denunció:\n1* las atrocidades de grupos islamistas radicales, no como tantos aquí que aprendieron que eran los talibanes hace 2 meses y ahora los llaman partisanos. Asesinos es su nombre, como es el del gobierno de irán o Arabia Saudita ente otros.\n2* crítico a los que claramente ocultan y defienden a estos asesinos bajo un pretexto de victimismo en Palestina.\nUn terrorista es un terrorista y lo es con 0 muertos en Palestina y con un millón de muertos.\n[#27](c27#c-27) 1a parte todo bien. Segunda, ya no tanto ¿Cómo que terrorista se es y punto?\n¿Crees de verdad que si a esta gente nadie estuviera tocándole los huevos en su casa harían lo mismo?\nIr a la raíz del problema, a las causas, e intentar desenredar un tema complejo no es defender a nadie.\nEstos son los que en Francia, España e Italia eran llamados partisanos por que no se que mierdas de las circunstancias? O estos los podemos llamar terroristas?\nLa yihad se lleva a cabo con muerte de infieles y el miedo a serlo.\nNo se trata de liberar nada, cada ataque sirve para atraer radicales y causar estragos en los no creyetes.\nQuien apoya a yihadistas es tan asesino como ellos.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Estos son los que llevan EEUU y UK financiando más de un siglo\nA lo más fundamentalista y extremista\nAquí cuando iban a la casa blanca a recibir paguitas\nhttps://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archivo:Reagan_sitting_with_people_from_the_Afghanistan-Pakistan_region_in_February_1983.jpg\n[#8](c8#c-8) bajo ninguna circunstancia son culpables de sus actos, siempre es otro, la culpa siempre será de EEUU, de UK, de la sociedad, de la Bernarda, pero nunca ellos y su fanatismo religioso serán los culpables para vosotros.\nVuestra fijación por defender o tapar cada asesino terrorista con escusas es repugnante y os rebaja como... Voy a decir seres humanos.\nEs decir para vosotros el fanatismo islámico viene de un supuesto apoyo de EEUU a hamas y no de irán...\nBoko haram es un paso de baile radicalizado por EEUU.\nLos talibanes son partisanos radicalizados por EEUU.\nLos hermanos musulmanes se radicalizado jugando call of duty.\nPero jamás lobbys, poderes y dinero de países radicales apoyan a estos grupos de mierda.\nAsí es vuestro mundo.\n[#12](c12#c-12) pero si tu pecas de lo mismo.\nA quien coño quieres dar lecciones?\nEEUU: apoyo yihadistas para quitarse de en medio a un enemigo común.\nTu: apoyas yihadistas para quitarte de en medio un enemigo común.\nEso que tienes ahí llamando nazis es la bandera de Israel no? Imagino que no eres simpatizante, pues eso.\nLa única deferencia entre EEUU y vosotros es que a EEUU sólo le movía la política, a vosotros os pierde el fanatismo.\nSabes lo que más me revienta de vosotros? Que no vais a ser vosotros quien caiga en esa oscuridad por vuestra culpa.\nHabrá niños de 15 que se sentirán libertadores, partisanos, defensores poniendo bombas para un estado islámico por vuestra culpa y vuestros comentarios.",
