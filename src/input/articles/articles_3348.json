    "text": "Por qué Bitcoin y Ethereum terminarán 2023 con fuerza - La acción del precio de BTC y ETH este año fue una de las mejores del siglo. - BTC mostró debilidad, lo que sugiere una caída por debajo de $43,000, mientras que ETH puede avanzar hacia $2,500. [Bitcoins [BTC]](https://ambcrypto.com/search/bitcoin) y [Etereum [ETH]](https://ambcrypto.com/search/ethereum) Las actuaciones en 2023 pasarían a ser consideradas una de las mejores de la historia del siglo, según reveló una publicación de Santiment. Al momento de esta publicación, BTC había podido recuperar $43,000. ETH, en el otro extremo, se disparó y cambió de manos a 2.380 dólares. La herramienta de análisis criptográfico, en su publicación, también mencionó que ETH y BTC poseen la capacidad de alcanzar sus valores más altos antes de que termine el año. 🥳📊 2023 está pasando a los libros como uno de los años de mejor desempeño del siglo, representando múltiples sectores importantes. [#Bitcoin]y [#Etereum]todavía están al alcance de superar los máximos de más de 1,5 años, que se establecieron hace apenas 3 semanas. [https://t.co/JxbW5vU5Iy] [pic.twitter.com/aLSGX5U2Vv] – Sentimiento (@santimentfeed) [27 de diciembre de 2023] Después del brillo, viene la fiesta. A principios de año, el mercado de las criptomonedas estaba luchando por recuperarse del colapso de FTX que hizo caer los precios. Durante ese tiempo, el valor de BTC era inferior a 17.000 dólares, mientras que ETH cotizaba un poco por encima de 1.200 dólares. El ascenso de Bitcoin y Ethereum fue impulsado por diferentes razones. Pero alrededor del primer trimestre (Q1), la razón principal fue el colapso de algunas de las principales instituciones tradicionales en los EE.UU. El colapso de los bancos en ese momento desencadenó desconfianza en las instituciones. A su vez, el mercado de criptomonedas liderado por Ethereum y Bitcoin se benefició de la liquidez retirada, ya que también afectó en buena medida a los precios. Si bien hubo otras razones para el continuo aumento de precios, la influencia notable que ha mantenido a ambas monedas en el lado verde es el optimismo en torno a un [potencial](https://ambcrypto.com/grayscale-files-revised-application-for-bitcoin-spot-etf-details-here/) ETF al contado. Durante la mayor parte del año, varias empresas han solicitado un ETF de Ethereum o Bitcoin. En unos pocos casos, algunas empresas solicitaron ambos. Estas solicitudes, a pesar de haber sido retrasadas por la SEC estadounidense, influyeron en las entradas de inversiones. En muchas ocasiones, AMBCrypto [revelado](https://ambcrypto.com/crypto-fund-inflows-surpass-2022-numbers-in-6-weeks/) Aumentos en el dinero que fluye hacia productos de inversión conectados a Bitcoin y Ethereum. Las entradas indicaron que varias instituciones confiaban en el desempeño a corto y largo plazo de las criptomonedas. Por lo tanto, no fue sorprendente que BTC registrara un aumento del 159% en lo que va del año (YTD). ETH también siguió subiendo un 98%. En los últimos días, hay predicciones de que las monedas podrían terminar el año aún mejor. Alcistas y osos se apresurarán por el gran premio Para Bitcoin, el gráfico diario mostró que había un fuerte soporte en $42,279. Sin embargo, el soporte en el nivel no fue una confirmación de una tendencia alcista. AMBCrypto evaluó la divergencia de convergencia de media móvil (MACD), que fue negativa. El MACD negativo indicó un creciente impulso bajista. Además, el índice de fuerza relativa (RSI) confirmó el sesgo cuando la lectura cayó a 54,52. Si esta tendencia continúa, Bitcoin podría terminar el año por debajo de los 43.000 dólares. Sin embargo, el gráfico anterior también muestra el volumen en equilibrio (OBV) que estaba aumentando. El aumento del OBV refleja una presión de volumen positiva que podría conducir a precios más altos. Si la presión de compra aumenta justo antes de que termine el año, BTC podría alcanzar los 45.000 dólares. Si no, un [hacia abajo](https://ambcrypto.com/is-bitcoin-due-for-a-price-correction/) moverse por debajo de $ 43,000 podría ser su próximo objetivo. Mientras tanto, el gráfico de 4 horas del ETH/USD refleja una estructura alcista. El 27 de diciembre, ETH había superado la resistencia de 2290 dólares. Pero el precio de la moneda enfrentó un rápido rechazo después de alcanzar los $2,415, lo que sugiere que había un grupo de acumulación en ese nivel. Aunque la volatilidad aumentó, la banda superior de las Bandas de Bollinger (BB) alcanzó el precio de ETH. Esto sugiere que la altcoin estaba sobrecomprada y el precio puede retroceder aún más. Pero al observar el Índice de Movimiento Direccional (DMI), la historia fue diferente. Realista o no, aquí está [La capitalización de mercado de ETH en términos de BTC](https://ambcrypto.com/calculator/marketcap) En el momento de esta edición, el +DMI (verde) era 33,92 mientras que el -DMI (rojo) era 16,35. Esta posición implicaba que las tendencias alcistas de ETH seguían siendo presión. Si el índice direccional promedio (ADX), de color amarillo, permanece por encima de 25 mientras el +DMI supera el -DMI, entonces ETH puede volver a probar $2,415 o [saltar](https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-why-a-big-eth-move-to-2-5k-might-be-imminent/) a $2,500 antes de que cierre el año.

For this week's picks, we have a running back going Over his projection in the freezing conditionals in Kansas City, a QB rushing for a TD in the snow in Buffalo, 2 running backs not hitting their numbers in climate-controlled conditions and one of the most dynamic wide receivers dominating his matchup.

Lines last updated Friday at 8:22 p.m. ET. All games ET unless noted. Texans RB Devin Singletary UNDER 66.5 rushing yards (-110) - Host Browns, Saturday, 4:30 p.m. (NBC) After a strong beginning when he became a starter, Singletary's numbers have dropped off primarily due to a lack a opportunities. He has topped this number just twice in his last 7 games. The reason for his lack of elite rushing days is that he has had 13 carries or fewer in 5 of the last 7 games, including just 9 carries against the Browns in Week 16. In order to top this number, he may need more than 15 carries and that may not be possible against a tough Browns defense that will make Houston earn everything it gets. Bills QB Josh Allen SCORES A TOUCHDOWN (-105) - Host Steelers, Sunday, 1 p.m. (CBS) Allen has scored 15 rushing TDs in his last 15 games, including 8 in his last 6 games. With a considerable amount of snow expected, when the Bills get near the goal line, Allen will likely call his own number to close out drives. He does when the weather is fine. He's likely to do it more often when the footing is bad and he knows where he's going while defenders try to react. Chiefs RB Isiah Pacheco OVER 66.5 rushing yards (-115) - Host Dolphins, Saturday, 8:10 p.m. (Peacock) One thing that is true about cold weather games is that the passing game is impacted much more negatively than the run game. No matter how sideline personnel try to keep the balls warm, when it's near zero degrees with 25 mph winds, the balls become like bricks in less than a minute. Pacheco has been the most consistent part of the Chiefs offense in their playoff run and has rushed 15 or more times in 5 of his 6 six games. In his last home game, he has rushed 18 times for 130 yards. With his speed and strength, if Pacheco gets 15 carries, which is very likely, it will be extremely difficult for the depleted Dolphins defense to keep him below this number. Lions RB Jahmyr Gibbs UNDER 52.5 rushing yards (-120) - Host Rams, Sunday, 8:15 p.m. (NBC) This one is a tough number not to surpass given the Lions elite offensive line, but there are a couple of factors that are going to make this number a little too high to pass barring a 20-yard carry along the way. The first is that veteran RB David Montgomery is the conventional runner coach Dan Campbell counts on to close out games and set the tone offensively. With the Lions making a rare playoff appearance, it is much more likely that Campbell will lean on Montgomery as the primary back and Gibbs as a change-of-pace/receiving back. The other issue is that the Rams are likely to come out throwing and try to turn the game into a shootout. If that happens, Gibbs may get his share of yardage as a receiver, but he likely won't get the carries he will need to top a number he hasn't beat in his last 2 games. Cowboys WR CeeDee Lamb OVER 98.5 receiving yards (-115) - Host Packers, Sunday, 4:30 p.m. (FOX) If the Cowboys are ever going to excise their playoff demons, it is going to require QB Dak Prescott to play some of the best ball of his career. To do that, it will require a heavy dose of Lamb. The Cowboys were chasing down the Eagles all season and have been playing playoff-style football for the last month and they have counted on Lamb to be the centerpiece of the offense. In his last 3 games, Lamb has caught 32 passes and posted yardage days of 118, 227 and 98. He has made his case of being the most dominant receiver in the league and will be targeted early often against a young Packers defense that will likely be unable to hold him down.

Highlighted by community leader Joyita Tonu's vow for open worship, this development reflects both a triumph over discrimination and a continued struggle for equality.\nAdvertisment Breaking Barriers: A Safe Haven for Worship The Dakshin Char Kalibari mosque represents more than just a physical structure; it is a beacon of hope for the hijra community, historically marginalized and often shunned from religious spaces. The mosque, a modest tin-clad shed, was constructed on government-donated land after local hijras faced expulsion from an established congregation. Its opening during Ramadan, a period of heightened spiritual reflection, underscores the mosque's significance as a communal hub and a symbol of hijra resilience. Sonia, a 42-year-old hijra who faced exclusion from mosques after coming out, shares her renewed sense of belonging and the end of a long-standing stigma attached to their community's presence in religious spaces.\nLegal Progress Amidst Social Stigma Advertisment Despite Bangladesh's legal recognition of hijras as a third gender since 2013 and the election of transgender individuals to political offices, the community continues to grapple with deep-rooted societal biases. Lack of property and marriage rights, employment discrimination, and higher rates of violence and poverty illustrate the ongoing challenges. The mosque's establishment, however, offers a counter-narrative to the hostility from conservative factions and showcases the hijra community's agency in reclaiming their religious and social identity.\nCommunity and Acceptance The mosque not only serves as a place of worship but also houses a graveyard, addressing past instances where hijras were denied burial rights. Imam Abdul Motaleb's message of inclusivity resonates with the core Islamic teaching of universal brotherhood, challenging prevailing prejudices and inviting broader community engagement. The positive experiences of locals like Tofazzal Hossain, who have embraced the hijra community through shared worship, reflect a gradual transformation in public perception. The mosque's success and plans for expansion signify a hopeful trajectory towards greater acceptance and dignity for hijras in Bangladesh.\nAs the Dakshin Char Kalibari mosque for the Third Gender stands as a testament to progress and perseverance, it not only addresses the immediate needs of the hijra community but also paves the way for a more inclusive society. By transcending traditional barriers to worship, this initiative embodies a broader struggle for acceptance, equality, and the dignity of every individual, regardless of gender identity. It marks a pivotal moment in Bangladesh's social fabric, offering a model of inclusivity for communities worldwide.",
