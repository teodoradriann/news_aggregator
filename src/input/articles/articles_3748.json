    "text": "Lucknow University has decided to reduce the duration of all graduation examinations from three hours to two. The change was approved during an emergency meeting of the examination committee, held at the university’s administrative building. This revised rule will not apply to LLB (Bachelor of Laws) and BEd (Bachelor of Education) students, and there will be no changes to the duration of postgraduate exams. The new format for graduation exams, carrying a maximum of 75 marks, will divide the question paper into two sections.In the first section, students will be required to answer one out of two questions, carrying 15 marks. In the second section, students will attempt any three of eight questions, with each question worth 20 marks, informed LU spokesperson Durgesh Srivastava. Graduation exams will now be held in three shifts: 8:30-10:30 am, 11:30 am-1:30 pm, and 2:30-4:30 pm. Meanwhile, postgraduate exams will continue to follow their existing schedule, conducted in two slots: 9 am-12 pm and 1:30-4:30 pm.",

    "text": "The Supreme Court of Guam on Thursday affirmed the Superior Court’s decision granting a man’s motion to suppress evidence in a case involving a warrantless search conducted by Guam Police Department officers. A warrantless search is presumptively unreasonable, the upper court said. “In reviewing the trial court’s decision to grant (Zerxes Jabidando) Viva’s motion to suppress and the inconsistencies and contradictions in the officers’ accounts, the trial court’s decision to suppress the evidence was not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm the Superior Court’s order granting Viva’s motion to suppress,” the justices wrote. The Dec. 28 opinion was authored by Justice Katherine A. Maraman and joined by Chief Justice Robert J. Torres and Justice F. Philip Carbullido. Because the Superior Court had concerns about the credibility of the people’s witnesses, it was not clearly erroneous for the Superior Court to determine that it was unclear whether Viva consented to the search and that the evidence obtained during the search should be suppressed, according to the Supreme Court. GPD Sgt. Ephraim Amaguin conducted a traffic stop after witnessing Viva drive through a stop sign, based on the transcript of the motion to suppress hearing in July 2022. After pulling over, Viva exited the car on his own, and Viva and Amaguin stood in front of the vehicle. According to court documents, the GPD sergeant performed none of the ordinary inquiries of a traffic stop. He did not ask for Viva’s license or registration, run the plates of the car, check for outstanding warrants, or issue a ticket or citation for failing to stop at the stop sign. Instead, according to Amaguin, he asked Viva: (1) if he was still on probation, to which Viva answered yes, (2) if he had any drugs on him, to which Viva answered no, and (3) for permission to search Viva’s vehicle, to which Viva gave consent, based on Amaguin’s testimony. However, he later testified that he could not recall when in the string of events this conversation had occurred, court documents stated. According to Amaguin, after obtaining consent, he requested backup to conduct the search and GPD Officer Christopher Champion and trainee Officer Clomera Conner responded to the request. According to court documents, Champion testified he did not ask Viva for consent to search the vehicle. He testified he discovered a large kitchen knife and saw a suspicious message banner on Viva’s phone that Champion believed to be related to a drug deal but he took no photographs of the message nor did he extract any data from Viva’s phone. The officers found a baggie containing a substance that tested positive for methamphetamine using a field test. They also found Viva’s wallet containing $2,000 but it’s unclear from their testimony whether they found the wallet during the search of Viva’s car or if they discovered it on his person. Champion arrested Viva. The other officer, Conner, testified that none of the officers read Viva his Miranda rights. In contrast, Champion testified that he read Viva his Miranda rights at the precinct. In its decision and order, the Superior Court questioned the truthfulness of the GPD officers’ testimony and ultimately did not find it persuasive. Instead, the trial court found the officers presented inconsistent testimony and that it was unclear whether Viva consented to the search. Ultimately, unable to find that the officers obtained consent, the trial court granted Viva’s motion to suppress. The Office of the Attorney General appealed the suppression, arguing the trial court did not properly address Viva’s consent. In affirming the trial court decision, the Supreme Court said “the decision to grant Viva’s motion to suppress was based on the trial court’s justified concerns about the credibility of the officers’ testimony, not on a failure to properly address the issue of consent.”",

Hundreds of them left something behind as a huge shrine to the visionary behind Blue Velvet and Mulholand Drive took shape at the feet of the Big Boy statue on Riverside Drive.\nThe David Lynch Shrine at Bob's Big BoyPhoto by Irvin Rivera As the tributes continued to pour in, the installation was being disassembled Wednesday afternoon by archivist and historian Kat Fox, who wrote her UCLA thesis on roadside shrines and spontaneous memorializations. Fox has previously studied temporary monuments to people lost from COVID, AIDS and 9/11. “Lynch doesn’t have a star on the Walk of Fame which is where these often crop up,” Fox said. “I’m very interested in the way L.A. chooses to memorialize and the way the community comes together in a place like Bob’s that has larger connections to the movie and TV industry,” she said. “It’s a cultural cornerstone and part of David Lynch lore.”\nThe David Lynch Shrine at Bob's Big BoyPhoto by Irvin Rivera\nBob's Big Boy in BurbankPhoto by Chris Nichols The landmark restaurant was a longtime favorite of the acclaimed director, who had a fondness for the lost world of 1950s Americana, and where he wrote and found inspiration. “I went there every day for seven years,” the director remarked after a film screening. “I would write on the napkins. It was like having a desk. You need paper and there’s a piece of paper and you write on it when you get ideas.”\nThe David Lynch Shrine at Bob's Big BoyPhoto by Irvin Rivera Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The black coffee, cigarettes and damn fine cherry pie were spilling onto the sidewalk when Rory MacDonald of Bob’s got the call from Fox seeking to preserve the contents. “I’ve seen public memorials before but nothing like this,” MacDonald said. “They’re usually put up by family. This feels like family where everybody comes together. It’s the power of community.”\nThe David Lynch Shrine at Bob's Big BoyPhoto by Irvin Rivera Original drawings and paintings, poetry, and personal letters were mixed in with stuffed logs, real logs , donuts, Cheetos and keys to the hotel where special agent Dale Cooper stayed in Twin Peaks . “There’s half-drunk coffee and half-smoked cigarettes,” Fox said. “It’s like they’re sharing it with him.” An estimated 400 cigarettes, 45 cups of coffee, and dozens of donuts and pie slices were accessioned, documented and photographed before finding their way to the Dumpster.\nThe David Lynch Shrine at Bob's Big BoyPhoto by Irvin Rivera The restaurant noted a 30% bump in sales over the last week and customers milled around outside waiting to be called for a table. Comedian Dana Gould , who added a contribution to the shrine, echoed the feeling of loss from fans gathered around the statue. “He died and took half the town with him,” Gould lamented. “The last weekend of the Biden presidency, the fires and David Lynch left the earth. I’m here doing what Lynch did. I’m sitting and writing because I don’t want to go home.”\nThe David Lynch Shrine at Bob's Big BoyPhoto by Irvin Rivera MacDonald has added photos and quotes from the filmmaker to video screens inside the restaurant and plans to display a few items from the memorial in a permanent shadowbox. “So fans can see the walls he used to see,” he says. “And drink the shake he used to drink.”\nArchivist Kat Fox boxing up the David Lynch shrinePhoto by Irvin Rivera Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement What will happen to the carefully packed boxes of art and artifacts? “I’m hoping to find a permanent and appropriate place,” Fox says. “Whether that’s Lynch-dedicated holdings or other special collections. I don’t have the ideal place in mind but there are so many film and TV archives in L.A.” As the work was wrapping up after dark, actors Eric Edelstein , George Griffith and Rebekah Del Rio , who all appeared in the 2017 Twin Peaks as well as Lynch’s longtime producer Sabrina Sutherland met up for dinner after stopping by the statue and meeting Fox.\nActor Eric Edelstein at the David Lynch shrinePhoto by Chris Nichols Earlier in the week, a community of Lynch lovers gathered at Dynasty Typewriter for a tribute hosted by Edelstein. They raised money for wildfire victims including fellow Twin Peaks alumni Carel Struycken who lost his home in Altadena . “When you’re weird,” Gould said. “You don’t want to feel alone.”\nRory MacDonald of Bob's helps clean up Photo by Chris Nichols Advertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 29,097 people played the daily Crossword recently.

    "text": "El delantero ecuatoriano Allen Obando arribó a Florida, Estados Unidos, para someterse a pruebas médicas con Inter Miami, donde se unirá a Lionel Messi y Luis Suárez.\nAllen Obando, de 18 años, llegó este miércoles 19 de marzo de 2025 a Florida, Estados Unidos, para realizarse pruebas médicas con Inter Miami. El ‘tricolor’ jugará en ‘Las Garzas’ tras ser adquirido por el Atlético Madrid Group que lo cedió a préstamo al club de la Major League Soccer (MLS).\nEl joven atacante aterrizó en Florida procedente de Ecuador, donde destacó en el Barcelona SC de Guayaquil. Su traspaso al Atlético Madrid Group se concretó por 4 millones de dólares. Obando cedido al Inter Miami hasta diciembre de 2025, se da en una operación que busca potenciar al equipo liderado por Messi y Suárez. “Allen Aldair. Dios te bendiga”, expresó Antonio Álvarez, presidente de Barcelona.\nObando, quien debutó profesionalmente en 2022 a los 16 años, disputó 23 partidos con Barcelona SC, marcó 4 goles y registró 3 asistencias. Su llegada a la MLS marca su primera experiencia internacional, uniéndose a un plantel estelar que incluye a figuras como Messi, Suárez, Sergio Busquets y Jordi Alba.\nRefuerzo estratégico para Inter Miami\nLa incorporación de Obando responde a la estrategia de Inter Miami de combinar talento joven con experiencia consagrada. El club, dirigido por Javier Mascherano, busca consolidarse como contendiente en la MLS y la Concacaf Champions Cup. El préstamo proviene del grupo propietario del Atlético de Madrid, que adquirió al jugador con miras a su desarrollo a largo plazo.\nTras superar las pruebas médicas, Obando será presentado en las próximas horas y se integrará a los entrenamientos del equipo. Su destino tras el préstamo podría ser el Atlético San Luis en México o, si destaca, el propio Atlético de Madrid en España.\nEl traspaso de Obando se gestó desde febrero de 2025, cuando se reportaron negociaciones avanzadas entre Barcelona SC y el Atlético Madrid Group. El club ecuatoriano retuvo un porcentaje de una futura venta, asegurando beneficios económicos a largo plazo. Este movimiento refleja la creciente conexión entre el fútbol sudamericano y la MLS.\nJulio Moreira V.",

A criminal complaint reviewed by Law & Crime stated that Surrell had \"a phone conversation with a reporting party\" where she shared her plan to carry out her arson \"hit list.\" The complaint noted that Surrell \"is a Fire Cadet with the Shenandoah Fire Department, giving her potential knowledge to carry out the act.\" She also sent the \"hit list\" through Snapchat text messages, according to authorities. \"It is alleged that Surrell threatened to commit acts of Arson towards the people on this list,\" the Fremont County Sheriff’s Office said in a press release . Surrell has been charged with seven counts of felony threat of terrorism and is being held on a $5,000 bond. Authorities believe there is no threat to Sidney High School at this time.",

    "title": "'Blindsided.' UNC Charlotte elementary school's abrupt closure displaces 116 students",
    "text": "Education\n‘Blindsided.’ UNC Charlotte elementary school’s abrupt closure displaces 116 students\nFor many CMS teachers, students and families, the last day of school brought feelings of achievement, gratitude and joy.\nFor the Niner University Elementary School community, it brought shock and devastation, said director Pamela Broome.\nThe public school in west Charlotte started in 2020 through partnership between UNC Charlotte and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools to support students coming from low-performing schools or having education difficulties. CMS provided transportation, building and food services. UNC Charlotte staffed the school, molded curriculum and gave college students real-world experience.\nBut UNC Charlotte announced June 9 the school would close because of its aging facility and low enrollment. Though it remains unclear what role UNC Charlotte had in the closure. The college provided a statement saying it’s committed to supporting former staff and affected families.\n“Everybody was just blindsided by it,” said Sietta Moore, a Niner Elementary parent.\nTimeline and agreement\nNiner University Elementary found its beginnings in 2016, when the North Carolina General Assembly approved the development of nine laboratory schools across the UNC System.\nUNC Charlotte and the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education agreed to a five-year contract from 2020 to 2025. Broome said CMS provided a letter of intent to renew Niner Elementary’s lease when the UNC Board of Governors renewed the contract in the fall.\nA CMS spokesperson also confirmed the district communicated an intent to extend the agreement for the 2025-26 school year.\nBut in a June 6th letter to UNC Charlotte Chancellor Sharon Gaber, Superintendent Crystal Hill said CMS would not renew the contract before its expiration on June 30.\n“By making this decision now, families have the opportunity to enroll in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (“CMS”) immediately for all students at the beginning of the 2025-26 school year.”\nThe lottery application for CMS magnet schools, however, closed Jan. 3, leaving many families to enroll in their zoned school or join the waitlist at others.\nMoore’s rising fifth grader and her son, a rising kindergartner, are on the wait list at Queen’s Grant Community School. She’s worried about finding a school that works with her family’s needs, including before- and after-school care offerings before the next academic year.\n“What if I can get my kids into a school? I’m just like, oh my gosh,” she said.\nMany families won’t have much choice except to return to their home schools, Broome said. She added the closure notice left her feeling “shocked” and “devastated.”\nTeacher jobs in CMS\nHill’s letter also encouraged the school staff to apply for vacancies within CMS and said the district’s recruitment team would provide “dedicated support” throughout the application process.\nAbout 97% of all CMS teacher vacancies have been filled said Nancy Brightwell, who leads CMS retention and recruitment, in a Monday news conference.\n“Our talent acquisition team was out there for about a half a day right after that announcement was made to facilitate supporting any one of those employees who would choose to come to work for Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools,” Brightwell said.\nEveryone who worked at Niner Elementary will no longer have a job after June 30, Broome confirmed. She said CMS is trying to work with parents the best they can and added she doesn’t think their placement personnel were anticipating the closure either.\n“I would have appreciated a little bit more support for our staff,” she said.\nFacility and Enrollment\nLocated at the former Amay James Pre-K, the school faced HVAC and plumbing issues that would’ve been expensive to replace, Broome said.\n“The 56 year-old facility is beginning to deteriorate with increased maintenance needs. Many of the operational systems are in need of major repair or replacement, which have contributed to the increased costs of maintaining the school facility,” a CMS spokesperson said.\nBroome questioned why Niner Elementary couldn’t be relocated like Western Carolina University’s lab school, The Catamount School, which moved from a high school to WCU’s campus.\n“I don’t understand why we didn’t take some time to explore other options, because I do agree the building here needs to be significantly repaired or updated,” she said.\nMoore said she was unaware of the facility issues and low enrollment.\n“It really just seemed like any other year, like we were just going to see everybody next year,” she said.\nThe school ended the year with 116 students. Hill’s letter said that Niner Elementary’s enrollment goal of at least 300 students hadn’t been achieved.\nMoore said, if she and other parents had known of the enrollment difficulty, they could’ve helped with social media outreach and community advertising.\n“I feel like that should have just been communicated to us and we could have tried to help,” she said.\nNiner University’s innovative education approach played a role in the Cato College’s award of a five-year grant and potential endowment of up to $23 million for a new literacy center.\nResponsibility and Impact\nMany students battle emotional distress and anxiety all the time, Broome said, which is why Niner’s teaching framework revolved around teaching emotional regulation in addition to academics.\n“Think about on those mornings when you wake up and you have to be somewhere at a certain time, but for whatever reason the alarm clock didn’t go off, and you’re just having a crazy morning: you spilled your coffee and had to change your clothes, and you’re just running behind,” she said. “You get on the interstate and the traffic is sitting still by the time you get to wherever you’re going you are not regulated.”\nNiner Elementary was a Title I designated school, meaning the majority of students live near or below the poverty line.\nThrough a UNC Charlotte Cato College of Education program, teacher candidates could immerse themselves in the classroom for an entire semester while completing coursework rather than just a couple weeks of required clinical training.\nThe immersion restructured the required clinical hours assigned to courses to better serve the needs of teacher education candidates, the elementary school’s now-archived website stated. Broome said teacher candidates who went through this program received more hands-on engagement.\n“When you think about teacher retention, especially in high-need schools, these teachers are going in far more prepared because of the experiences they’ve had,” she said.\nMoore said she had a great experience with the teachers and teacher candidates that worked with her daughter.\nShe said hearing about Niner’s closure was “heartbreaking” for her daughter. She added that Niner’s “motherly” teachers made the classroom “a safe space” where her child felt comfortable.\n“We were like a family, and now that family dynamic is broken,” she described.\nBroome recommended Niner Elementary parents speak with counselor services at their new school and advocate for their children to receive trauma-informed services.\nShe also said there’s been a lack of support for the “emotional distress” Niner Elementary parents, teachers, students and community members are going through.",

    "text": "Steps Towards a Healthier You: Embracing a Journey of Wellness Published April 4, 2024 By Leo Alvarez CHPS Health Promotion Services LUKE AIR FORCE BASE, Ariz. -- In our quest for better health, it is essential to recognize that achieving wellness is not a destination but a lifelong journey. It is about making conscious choices and taking meaningful steps towards a healthier and happier life. Throughout this journey, we can find support, guidance, and inspiration from various sources, including our community and the resources provided by the Civilian Health Promotion Services (CHPS) Program. One crucial aspect of this journey is understanding the importance of connecting with others. Wellness is not just about individual efforts; it thrives in a supportive and collaborative environment. Engaging with like-minded individuals who share similar goals and aspirations can provide motivation, accountability, and a sense of belonging. By connecting with our community, whether it is through group activities, online forums, or wellness events, we can foster a sense of camaraderie and build a strong support system. Our Civilian Wellness web portal, available through www.USAFwellness.com, offers valuable tools and resources to aid us in our wellness journey. The Health Risk Assessment (HRA), for instance, provides a comprehensive snapshot of our overall health. By understanding our baseline health, we can identify potential risks and take proactive steps to address them. The HRA becomes even more effective when supplemented with additional information, such as recent blood work and vitals, allowing for more accurate results and tailored recommendations. Throughout our wellness journey, addressing various aspects that contribute to our overall well-being is crucial. Weight management plays a significant role in maintaining health, necessitating an understanding of excess weight's impact and tips for goal setting, interpreting body composition, and making informed food choices. Comprehensive nutrition knowledge, including understanding U.S. Dietary Guidelines, portion control, and the role of protein in muscle maintenance, is key. Additionally, recognizing the impact of exercise on health, understanding the FITT (Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type) Principle, and being aware of hydration can help maintain an active lifestyle. Both nutrition and physical activity are pivotal to well-being. Lastly, we cannot overlook the impact of sleep and stress on our overall well-being. By emphasizing the importance of quality sleep and offering strategies for stress management, we can empower individuals to prioritize self-care and find balance in their lives. Embracing a journey of wellness is a transformative experience that involves making positive choices, connecting with others, and utilizing the resources available to us. By recognizing the importance of community support, exploring key wellness topics, and leveraging the CHPS Program's tools and resources, we can embark on a fulfilling path towards better health and well-being.",
