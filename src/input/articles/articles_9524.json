    "title": "Marineland ordered to pay $85K after 3 bears kept in cramped quarters for months",
    "text": "Marineland has been ordered to pay nearly $85,000 in fines and restitution after it was found guilty under Ontario’s animal cruelty laws of three charges related to its care of three black bears. The amount, which was jointly proposed by lawyers for the Crown and Marineland, includes a $15,000 fine for each of the bears, a 25-per-cent victim surcharge and $28,000 in restitution for the care of the bears after they were seized by animal welfare officers. The Niagara, Ont., tourist attraction was found guilty in March in what’s believed to be its first conviction under animal-cruelty laws. An agreed statement of facts read in court earlier this year said the bears – Slash, Toad and Lizzy – lived in small enclosures with inadequate access to water for months. It said the enclosures measured 48 square feet, with the two females, Toad and Lizzy, sharing one. The statement said animal welfare inspectors visited Marineland in early June 2021 and soon issued orders to the park, including that the bears have enclosures of at least 5,000 square feet if alone and access to water sources. Not enough progress had been made on the enclosures months later, court heard Thursday in an updated statement, and Animal Welfare Services eventually removed all three bears from the park’s care. A lawyer representing Marineland told the court Thursday the orders were issued during the COVID-19 pandemic and it was difficult to find staff to do the carpentry work required to improve the enclosures, but that efforts were underway at the time the bears were removed. Michelle Psutka added the sentence represents a “significant” fine. “This is a first-time offence for Marineland, and again we are dealing with a fail-to-comply case, not a case of a finding of animal cruelty,” she said in her submissions. Marineland has until late September to pay the restitution fee, which the Crown said is based on costs of $145 a day to care for two of the bears over roughly six months before they were brought to a permanent enclosure at a wildlife facility. The justice of the peace overseeing the case said she was satisfied the jointly proposed sentence addressed the need for deterrence as well as any aggravating and mitigating factors. Animal Justice, an animal law advocacy organization, expressed disappointment that prosecutors didn’t seek an order prohibiting Marineland from having other animals, and that no ongoing remedial measures were imposed. However, the organization — which unsuccessfully sought to participate in the sentencing as an intervener — hailed the ruling as historic as it marks the first time the roadside zoo and aquarium has faced legal consequences for animal welfare offences. “Today marks a watershed moment in the fight to protect vulnerable animals from being abused for entertainment,” Camille Labchuk, the organization’s executive direction, said in a statement. The province has been investigating the park for four years. One killer whale, 14 beluga whales and one dolphin have died at the park since 2019. Currently, 15 bears remain at Marineland. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 15, 2024.",

    "text": "Christmas of fear in Nepal due to growing anti-Christian hatred\nThe 12 parishes of the Apostolic Vicariate of Nepal have been asked to take additional security measures during Christmas due to possible attacks by Hindu extremists. \"Christmas is a time of joyful celebration and we should celebrate it with joy and not with fear,\" said Father Silas Bogati, vicar general of the Apostolic Vicariate of Nepal.\nKathmandu (AsiaNews/Agencies) – Christians in Nepal have been advised to be on high alert during the Christmas period following a number of incidents of anti-Christian violence that have occurred in the country in recent months at the hands of Hindu extremist groups.\n“There is a sense of fear and insecurity rippling through the Christian community amid Christmas celebrations. We feel exposed to hostility for being Christian,” said\nFather Lalit Tudu, parish priest at Assumption Cathedral in the capital Kathmandu, the country’s largest church. “The right to practise our faith peacefully is threatened to some extent,” he lamented.\nThe 12 parishes that come under the Apostolic Vicariate of Nepal have been asked to take additional security measures over Christmas. “Local administrations and security agencies are supportive of providing extra security” for Christmas services, the clergyman explained.\nAccording to the 2023 national census, Christians number 513,000 or less than 2 per cent of the country’s population.\nWorshippers who attend religious services have also been asked not to carry bags or packages as part of security measures to avoid the possibility that members of extremist cells might bring explosives into a church.\nKathmandu Cathedral has also installed security cameras on its premises.\nNepali Christians have experienced several violent incidents since last August, after a video that went viral on social media claimed to show members of a Christian community eating beef in a village near the city of Dharan in eastern Nepal.\nHindus constitute 80 per cent of Nepal’s population of about 24 million. The most orthodox among them consider the cow to be a representation of their mother goddess. That is why they hate anyone caught eating beef.\nThe specious accusations made in the video prompted radical Hindu groups to attack seven churches and some members of the Christian community in different parts of the country.\nThe right-wing Hindu nationalist Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP or National Democratic Party), in cooperation with extremist Hindu groups, has also organised protest rallies, calling for the restoration of the Nepali monarchy.\nIn 2006, the Nepali parliament voted to abolish the monarchy leading to the secularisation of the state. Christmas was eventually declared a national holiday, but since 2018, Christmas celebrations have been reserved for Christians only.\nFollowing the August violence, local officials alerted the Kathmandu International Christian Congregation and local Christian leaders of a \"possible bomb attack\" against their main church.\nSince then, Christian organisations have been on high alert, mindful of what happened on 23 May 2009, when a Hindu extremist group bombed a church, killing three Catholics and injuring another 14 at a prayer meeting. In April 2017 the cathedral was also damaged by arson.\nStill, “Christmas is a time of joyful celebration and we should celebrate it with joy and not fear,” said Father Silas Bogati, vicar general of the Vicariate Apostolic of Nepal.\nNepalese Christians passing by the Catholic Church of the Assumption before Christmas celebrations in Lalitpur, on the outskirts of Kathmandu (Photo: AFP)\nA bloody New Year in Egypt as two Coptic brothers killed\n02/01/2018 15:31\nThousands of Christians celebrate Christmas in Kathmandu despite limitations on religious freedom\n24/12/2016 17:55",

    "text": "A comet that last passed Earth 80,000 years ago, when Neanderthals walked the Earth, will be visible to the naked eye starting Saturday evening. The comet is named Tsuchinshan-ATLAS, and scientists have dubbed it the “comet of the century” due to its brightness and visibility. Purple Mountain Observatory in China first spotted the comet and calculated that its orbit would cross the Earth’s hemisphere in September or October 2024. In late September and last week, some people in the Southern Hemisphere were able to catch a glimpse of the comet as it appeared as a fuzzy star sitting low in the pre-dawn sky. But now, the comet is moving through the Northern Hemisphere sky — including where the United Kingdom and the United States reside, meaning that skywatchers will get to see the comet through telescopes, binoculars, or even their naked eye. People will also be able to capture the comet on camera. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER The comet will reach its closest point to Earth on October 12, but NASA said it could be visible through the end of October. Viewers are advised to watch for the comet from the western horizon straight after the sun sets, but it will be a small window to watch it pass. The comet will disappear roughly 30 minutes after the sun sets.",

    "text": "Bill Goldberg’s retirement match will happen in WWE at some point in 2025, and he’s busy right now preparing his body for it.\nWhile talking about this subject on his CarCast show, the 58-year-old Goldberg said he’s doing all of this work for just one night. It sounds like his ass is bearing the brunt of the training so far, assuming he is accurate with his use of the word “literally.”\n“Ugh...I’m thinking, I’m doing all of this shit for one night. That’s what I’m thinking. I mean I’m literally busting my ass. I’m up here in the garage, in the gym, every night. Granted, I don’t work out like I used to. It’s a 45 minute Jack LaLanne workout as opposed to the old Goldberg days.”\nBill goes on to say he will use stem cells to repair his old and damaged body.\n“I stretch for like 45 minutes. ‘Cause I remember I used to have to stretch for like 10, but now I got to stretch for an hour and 10 because I’m so ancient. I got to crawl before I run. We all know I got a pretty screwed up shoulder, and that’s my biggest concern getting into this retirement match.\n...It’s all about baby steps. I have a decent amount of time to prep. The reality is [that I am going to] embark upon a journey to try and kick start myself to get in the best shape possible, try to rehab as much as possible, so that I can have a good base to build on. That extremely long dissertation means that I’m going to go get stem cells.”\nGoldberg noted that he hates MRI machines because he’s “claustrophobic as dog shit.” But he had to go take MRIs to see the extent of the damage in his neck, shoulder, and knee. He then admitted that he essentially needs to learn how to use his right arm again.\n“The fact is I’m really trying to retrain myself to use my arm, because the damage that I incurred prohibited me from using it. I stopped using it for a number of years, I really did. I faked it really well, but I stopped using it primarily as my go-to. I did everything left-handed. Fortunately I’m ambidextrous, and so it really didn’t matter, except for the fact that every time that I didn’t use my right arm, the atrophy just set in more and more and more and more.”\nThat may sound bleak, but Goldberg did reveal that he has a lot more movement in his shoulder right now then he did six months ago.\nI’m just reading between the lines here, but it sounds to me like Goldberg’s old, damaged body won’t be ready in time for a match at WrestleMania 41 in April. Perhaps he’ll have his retirement match later this year during one of WWE’s trips to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia?\nAre you optimistic about Bill Goldberg being able to get his ancient body in shape for his retirement match later in 2025?
