    "text": "At a time of Russian aggression, everyone sees how important it is to maintain alliances, to strengthen our own security and to take care of the security of neighbors - address by the President of Ukraine\nPresident of Ukraine\n7 March 2024 - 20:01\nI wish you health, fellow Ukrainians!\nA few summaries of the day.\nI held a meeting with the Head of the Foreign Intelligence Service to discuss current threats and some sensitive areas of our international activities. I am grateful to everyone in the world who helps Ukraine with the proper focus of our country's attention.\nWe also continue to work with our partners - I had a meeting with the UK Secretary of State for DefenÑe, who was on a visit to Ukraine today. I thanked him for the UK's tangible leadership in security support for Ukraine, in strengthening our defense and the world's joint capabilities to defend against Russian aggression. Today we discussed our further cooperation. The priorities are obvious - air defense, long-range weapons, artillery. Supply and joint production. And achieving justice, so that every Russian murderer and their entire terrorist state are held accountable for this war. We have already reached a historically unprecedented level of cooperation with Britain. By the way, it was with Britain that we signed the first bilateral agreement on security commitments. We must fully implement it for the sake of our common strength.\nToday, I also approved the candidate for the position of our country's ambassador to the UK. General Valerii Zaluzhnyi told me that this is the direction he would like to take - diplomacy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine has sent a corresponding request for agrÃ©ment. Our alliance with Britain should only get stronger.\nAnd today there are several decrees worth mentioning. I have signed two decrees on awarding state decorations to our warriors - 520 more servicemen of the Armed Forces. Each and every one of them deserves our gratitude and respect. And today there is also a decree to discharge conscripts - those who were called up for military service before the start of the full-scale invasion. Now, at the request of the military command, a few weeks are needed for preparatory procedures - for replacing people in terms of defense tasks, and from April, the conscripts will be sent to the reserve. I know that some of them have signed a contract to serve in the Defense Forces. I am grateful to everyone.\nAnd a few more things for today.\nI had the honor to hand over apartment certificates to the Heroes of Ukraine and the families of the fallen Heroes. This is our new tradition of specially honoring every warrior whose bravery has become a paragon.\nI would like to thank all our people in the regions bordering Russia - Sumy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv. Everyone who protects these regions from subversive groups and enemy shelling, who saves people. This is extremely important and we appreciate it. Each and every one of you who is doing everything to preserve normal life. Today, Russia launched another attack on Sumy. There are wounded. Unfortunately, there are dead. My condolences to all those who have lost their loved ones. The Russian state will definitely be held accountable for this evil. Our warriors will ensure accountability of the terrorists.\nToday, it is important to note that one more country in Europe has achieved greater protection from Russian evil. The procedures for Sweden's accession to NATO are being finalized.\nWhen the security of one country is guaranteed and when that country is able to truly strengthen common security, everyone wins. This rule has worked consistently throughout NATO's existence. And I believe it will work in the future.\nNow, at a time of Russian aggression against everything that has made Europe peaceful and united, everyone sees how important it is to maintain alliances and partnerships, to strengthen our own security and to take care of the security of neighbors.\nSweden is a strong ally and a country that can be trusted. And I congratulate everyone in Sweden and everyone in the Euro-Atlantic area. Ukraine has always supported Sweden in its pursuit of NATO membership, and I thank Sweden for its support of our country - there will be a day when Sweden will be able to congratulate Ukraine on joining the Alliance as well. Together, we are always stronger.\nI thank everyone who is in Ukraine and with Ukraine! Glory to all those who fight and work for the sake of our country and people!\nGlory to Ukraine!\n|\n|\nNEWSLETTER\n|Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list|\n|\n||\n|",

    "title": "Warm weather wreaks havoc on some B.C. ski hills as lack of snow leaves trails barren",
    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open. Fewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions. Warmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan. In Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas. On Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain. Warm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each. Mount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow. James Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season. \"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said. \"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\" Apex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls. Shalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow. \"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\" At Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open. Several resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit. \"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled. Environment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland. Proctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\" He said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior. But Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations. \"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.

    "text": "On August 8, 2024 (KST), rapper Lee Young Ji shared an exciting tweet—and other social media updates—announcing the return of her beloved YouTube show, My Alcohol Diary (also known as No Prepare ).\nInstagram에서 이 게시물 보기\n차린건 쥐뿔도 없지만(@youngji_gbbul_nocharim)님의 공유 게시물\nThe third season of the sool-bang , or “drinking show,” was first teased in June, though without set dates.\nLee Young Ji’s “No Prepare” Is Reportedly Gearing Up For Season 3\nSo, naturally, some viewers celebrated Lee Young Ji’s tweet confirming the return. Idol fans, and even celebrities themselves, flocked to the comments signing up to guest on the next season.\n차쥐뿔 돌아왔다\n술먹자 상차려라\n— 이영지 (@dokgodieinsaeng) August 8, 2024\nMy Alcohol Diary is back. Set the table, let’s drink.\n— Lee Young Ji\n안녕하세요. 저는 SF9의 인성입니다.\n차쥐뿔 너무나 즐겁게 잘 보고 있고요 저의 힐링프로그램입니다.\n에펜씨 다니고 시키는거 다해요 (주종 안가림, 양질의 토크 가능)\n행복한 목요일 되시길 바라며…🤩 #SF9 #INSEONG\n— SF9official (@SF9official) August 8, 2024\nHello, I’m SF9’s Inseong. I love My Alcohol Diary so much. It’s a program that heals me. I work at FNC and I’m willing to do whatever I’m told to do. (Can drink whatever, can talk about whatever.) I hope you have a great Thursday…\n— SF9’s Inseong\n안녕하세요 영지님 저는 송건희입니다\n제가 차쥐뿔 정말 사랑하는데요?\n혹시 상 차리면 달려가도 될까요?\n저요 제발 저요 저 아니면 안 돼요 제발요 저요 저 진짜 영지님 실물 영접 하고 싶습니다 저요 제발요\n— 송건희 (@nageonheeeeya) August 8, 2024\nHello, Young Ji. This is Song Geon Hee. I really love My Alcohol Diary . When the table is set, may I come over? Please pick me. If not me, then who? Please. I really want to meet you in person, too. Pick me, please.\n— Song Geon Hee\n영지님\n술 사갈게요\n톱스타 만들어주세요\n— 하성운 (@gooreumseng) August 8, 2024\nDear Young Ji. I’ll bring the alcohol. Please turn me into a superstar.\n— Ha Sung Woon\nOn the other hand, though, some viewers expressed uncertainty—especially given the “timing” of recent DUI scandal involving the BTS member Suga .\n| theqoo “The timing, though.” “Dear Young Ji… I like My Alcohol Diary , but how about postponing or drinking tea instead?” “It didn’t even seem like she drinks well, so I wish she wouldn’t drink for the sake of her health…” “I’d prefer it if she ate food instead of drinking alcohol.” “I’d say her show is the original sool-bang , but there are too many drinking shows now. It’s harmful. It should be restricted to 19+.” “Is she obtuse…? People have been talking because of the DUI scandal that broke a day before. Young Ji is generally a good person, but she simply will not listen when the topic of drinking comes up. Maybe because My Alcohol Diary is so popular.” “Stop with the drinking shows already.” “No, no. Stop with the alcohol!” “Ugh, I hate drinking shows.” “I mean, an age restriction would solve the problem rather than removing the content itself. There are countless more problematic shows out there, but it feels like Young Ji’s show is being targeted right now. If this is to be removed, YouTube would have to remove all alcohol-related content on the platform. Is that possible?” “The show name doesn’t even include alcohol, but drinking seems to be almost its identity… Why? How about just eating food…? Like people do… Or drinking coffee or traditional tea would be nice, too.” “Young Ji is NOT the one who caused trouble after drinking, so why are people picking on her show?” “Can she not host the show if she doesn’t get drunk?” Over the years, in general, Korea has seen concerns be raised over the increasing popularity of drinking shows.\nConcerns Are Raised Over The Increasing Popularity Of Idol Drinking Shows\nMeanwhile, an episode of My Alcohol Diary featuring a girl group member was crowned the top-ranking YouTube video in Korea for 2023.

    "title": "Ja'Marr Chase bashes Chiefs defense ahead of Week 17 matchup",
    "text": "The Cincinnati Bengals are facing off against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday in a matchup that the Bengals desperately need to win in order to keep their postseason hopes alive. And Bengals star wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase may have given the Chiefs defense some bulletin board material before the game with his comments to the media on Thursday. Chase was asked by reporters what stood out to him from the Chiefs secondary ahead of the game. This led Chase to tell reporters that nothing stood out to him at all from them. “If I am being honest nothing,” said Chase in a video shared on social media by Bengals beat writer Mike Petraglia. “They just know how to play us. They know the leverages and what splits we’re in. They just know what we’re going to do in certain moments. They throw their little double doubles at us on our best players on us on the outside. That’s all they really do. I mean, it’s not like they have a Jalen Ramsey on their squad. So not much.” Ja’Marr Chase had quite the edge after practice today addressing reporters. Said Chiefs don’t have anyone that stands out on defense. “It’s not really like have a Jalen Ramsey on their squad.” [pic.twitter.com/1kurBwcOLF] — Mike Petraglia (@Trags) [December 28, 2023] It’s true that the Chiefs don’t have a player that most typically refer to as a “shutdown cornerback” like Jalen Ramsey. However, the Chiefs do have the third-best passing defense in the NFL this season, so their cornerbacks certainly deserve their fair share of respect from Chase. Instead, Chase proceeded to double down on his comments, saying that the Chiefs defense can “take the comments how they want to”. “They can take it how they want to, I don’t care,” Chase added. “At the end of the day there is only so much I can do myself. It’s not like I’m Iron-Man. I can’t throw the football to myself. It’s a team sport. But I know what I see on paper. I know what I see in the game. That’s why they double everybody. Because they can’t do it one-on-one. The best player on their team is (L’Jarius) Sneed. That’s a fact. Everybody knows that. They know I’m good. They know how to play us. That’s what it is. But it’s not like they have a superstar on their defense.” Ja’Marr Chase didn’t back track at all when asked about his assessment of Chiefs defense. “They can take it how they want. I don’t care. … I’m not Ironman. I can’t throw the ball to myself. It’s a team sport.” [pic.twitter.com/KmnaKIcLYe] — Mike Petraglia (@Trags) [December 28, 2023] Again, it is one thing to say these things before the game. It’s a whole other thing to actually show the world that the Chiefs secondary isn’t all that it may seem to be in a game. It will be harder for Chase to prove this on Sunday than a normal matchup against the Chiefs. Not only is Chase coming into the game with a shoulder injury, but he will also be without star quarterback Joe Burrow, who has played in all of Chase’s previous matchups against the Chiefs in past years.",

    "text": "Secciones\nServicios\nDestacamos\nEmpieza la respuesta judicial a la oleada de amenazas de la extrema derecha francesa contra los magistrados. El Tribunal de Bobigny (periferia norte de París) ... condenó este miércoles por la tarde a ocho meses de prisión condicional a un internauta, de 76 años, que había amenazado de muerte a la jueza que inhabilitó a Marine Le Pen hasta 2030. La pena para este jubilado, que no tenía antecedentes, incluye una multa de 3.000 euros.\nTras el anuncio del veredicto por el caso de los falsos asistentes en el Parlamento Europeo de la ultraderechista Agrupación Nacional (RN, por sus siglas en francés), Gérard B. publicó en la red social X la fotografía de una guillotina, acompañada por el mensaje «es lo que merece esta puta». Lo escribió refiriéndose a la jueza Bénédicte de Perthuis, que presidió la corte que declaró culpable a Le Pen de haber llevado a cabo «un sistema» que permitió a su partido malversar 4,5 millones del Parlamento Europeo. Además de una inhabilitación a efectos inmediatos de cinco años, la líder de la extrema derecha fue condenada a cuatro años de prisión (dos ellos condicionales) y una multa de 100.000 euros.\nEl mensaje por parte de ese simpatizante de la derecha radical solo fue visto por 200 personas en la red social de Elon Musk. A pesar de ello, lo detuvieron y lo procesaron a través de un juicio rápido. «En Francia, hay personas a las que cortaron la cabeza» tras haber sufrido una campaña de acoso en internet, ha recordado el fiscal. Lo ha dicho refiriéndose al caso del profesor Samuel Paty, asesinado en 2020 por un joven yihadista. «Detrás de su teléfono en su casa (…), uno no asume ningún riesgo. Pero eso puede ser un pretexto para personas violentas o con problemas mentales», ha añadido el representante del Ministerio Público.\nEl autor de esa amenaza de muerte es un francés 'pied-noir' que nació en la Argelia francesa y se fue a la Francia metropolitana cuando tenía 14 años, tras la independencia de ese país. Actualmente, está jubilado tras haber dirigido una empresa de informática. Durante el juicio, se defendió con que la foto de la guillotina «era un «símbolo de justicia. Lo que quería decir es que algunos jueces quizás merecerían ser juzgados». Tras la sentencia del 31 de marzo, se multiplicaron en internet los mensajes insultantes y amenazantes contra Bénédicte de Perthuis. Hasta el punto de que tuvieron que desplegar una protección policial específica para esta magistrada.\n¿Ya eres suscriptor/a?

    "text": "Aaron Rodgers recently found himself in hot water after skipping the Jets’ mandatory minicamp for a vacation to Egypt. While the trip was no less than a personal achievement for the recovering veteran quarterback, it will now cost him more than just the price of his plane ticket to Africa. Reportedly, the Jets slapped Rodgers with a $50,000 fine for his absence.\nAdvertisement\nThough a visit to the pyramids might seem like a breeze for someone like Rodgers, given the rich history surrounding it, the\n[New York Jets](/tag/new-york-jets/) weren’t too thrilled with their QB stepping out of action during crucial practice sessions. After all, he missed two mandatory practice days.\nNEWS: Aaron Rodgers was fined 50 THOUSAND DOLLARS by the\n[#Jets]for going to Egypt during minicamp, Rodgers said today.\nThe\n[#Patriots]reportedly never fined Tom Brady during his 20 years with the team. [pic.twitter.com/6o3sv1zNuR]\n— MLFootball (@_MLFootball)\n[July 24, 2024]\nIn the world of football, fines are as common as touchdown passes, but this one certainly stands out for obvious reasons. On one hand, the Jets need their star quarterback on their side as they aim to regain their former glory. On the other hand, Rodgers was present for the ten-day practice leading up to the two-day camp he missed.\nHowever, the Jets have set an example that even the quarterbacks aren’t immune to team policies. But, this is in stark contrast to how the Patriots handled Tom Brady’s absences during his stint and success with the team. He was apparently never fined during his 20-year stint in Foxborough.\nRodgers Opened Up About His Side of the ‘Egypt Trip’ Story\nRodgers stirred up quite a commotion, trading the New Jersey skyline for the breathtaking views of Egypt. While he was present for the first 10 days, the two days he skipped were crucial for team building, especially with new players and rookies. After all, players don’t get much time together in the offseason to practice as a team.\nBut in classic Rodgers style, he’s got a side of the story that’s as intriguing as an Egyptian adventure. Speaking on “Pardon My Take”,\nRodgers shared his perspective, saying,\n“They can arbitrarily put a tag on whatever week of OTAs they want and say, ‘This is the minicamp week,’ which makes it somehow more mandatory than the other weeks. But it was an OTA schedule. That’s how words can be a little deceiving from time to time.”\nSo, was it really a minicamp, or just a couple of OTA days with a fancy name? Rodgers seems to think the latter. “They can make a story out of the fact that I missed minicamp, but it was really two OTA days, but [I] came to the first 10.”\nIt sounds like the quarterback isn’t losing any sleep over tags or the $50,000 fine he got slapped with. At the end of the day, it’s all about perspective.\nWhile the Jets might have been counting down the days, Rodgers was out exploring the pyramids, viewing it as a well-deserved break after a solid 10-day stint at camp. And honestly, blowing off steam before the season starts sounds like a good way to come back stronger.",
