    "text": "Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Wander Franco did not show up Thursday morning to answer a summons in the Dominican Republic pertaining to allegations he engaged in relationships with minors.\nFranco, 22, was ordered to meet with authorities from the Specialized Prosecutor's Office for Children and Adolescents in the city of Santo Domingo at 11 a.m. local time. Local newspaper Listin Diario posted a video to social media at about 11:45 a.m. that showed officials waiting for his arrival and listing him as a no-show, and agency director Olga Dina Llaverias later confirmed he did not appear.\nReports Thursday from the Dominican Republic also said that Franco had fired his legal team, and Dina Llaverias said the agency would continue building its case.\n\"There are a few options in the investigative process, but now is not an opportune time to speak about that,\" Dina Llaverias said.\nAuthorities in the Dominican Republic conducted a pair of searches Tuesday looking for Franco but were unable to find him, according to the newspaper.\nAt least two people have filed lawsuits against Franco, and he is under investigation for an alleged improper relationship with a third minor, ESPN reported.\nWhile no legal charges have been filed, Dominican-based MLB reporter Hector Gomez posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Tuesday: \"New evidence has been found in the case of Wander Franco that further implicates him in the accusations that have been made against him of alleged relationships with minors.\"\nThe Rays placed Franco on the restricted list Aug. 14 and then on paid administrative leave on Aug. 22 as MLB launched an investigation into social media posts indicating Franco was involved in an inappropriate relationship with a minor.\nFranco since was moved to Tampa Bay's active roster, but only because administrative leave is unavailable during the offseason. He could be placed back on administrative leave when spring training begins.\nFranco, who was first called up in 2021 as one of the most hyped prospects in recent years, played a career-high 112 games and was an All-Star for the first time in 2023. He set career highs in virtually all statistical categories, including home runs (17), RBIs (58), steals (30) and runs (65) while batting .281 with a .344 on-base percentage and a .475 slugging percentage.\n--Field Level Media",

    "text": "By Kevin Deutsch Coconut Creek commissioners have approved developers’ plans to build a Sprouts Farmers Market and Cali Coffee Shop at a city shopping center. The new retail spaces will be constructed at Strada Plaza, a 7.1-acre property near Lyons Road and Coconut Creek Parkway. City records show that the approximately 23,000-square-foot grocery store and 1,500-square-foot coffee shop will be constructed alongside a new 120,000-square-foot, five-story Sentry Self Storage property, which commissioners also approved at their May 11 meeting. It was unclear when the project developer, Strada CC Development LLC, intended to break ground. The new properties will be built alongside Walgreens, Regions Bank, and a multi-story medical office. The Sprouts supermarket chain is headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona. Known for selling fresh, organic, and natural foods at reasonable prices, the company has 380 stores in 23 states across the U.S., including more than 30 stores in Florida. Got News in Coconut Creek?

    "text": "You can visit her website at: www.doriswildhelmering.com . By Doris Wild Helmering, LCSW., BCD Thursday, 18 April 2024 04:03 PM EDT Current | Bio | Archive I lost my friend Mark to cancer a couple of months ago. I liked a lot of things about Mark — his soft-spoken manner, his easy laugh, his sense of adventure, his willingness to try new things, his zest for life. But above all, the thing I admired most was Mark’s ability to let go of a hurt and move on. Mark had a friend named Bill, and every so often the two of them would get together for lunch. One day when they were to meet, Bill never showed. So Mark had lunch alone. The sad thing was that when Bill realized he had missed lunch, he failed to call his friend and apologize. So Mark was a bit miffed. When Mark saw Bill, he said, “Say, Bill, what happened to our lunch?” Bill shrugged and said he had forgotten. Mark said, “But you didn’t call.” Bill replied, “Yeah, I know, but I got busy.” With that brush-off, Mark said, “Well, I’m angry about that. You should have called.” Again Bill defended his actions. At this point I could see things weren’t headed in a happy direction, so I jokingly said, “Okay, you two. You guys know you love each other. So Bill, tell Mark, ‘I love you, Mark.'” Bill looked at me a little askance (men don’t say “I love you” to their friends). Then he got this big childlike grin on his face and said, “I love you, Mark.” Without hesitation, Mark smiled and said, “I love you, Bill.” And the incident was over. From that moment on, I believe Mark never looked back on that missed engagement. Addendum: Over the next year as Mark was struggling with his illness, Bill would frequently say, “I love you, Mark.” Mark would get a grin on his face and respond, “I love you, Bill.” © 2024 NewsmaxHealth.

    "text": "Keith Kunzig, better known as \"Big Nasty,\" was Tampa Bay's ultimate fan for 35 years. He was also good friends with Denver's \"Barrel Man,\" another Pro Football Hall of Famer. Kunzig spoke with The Denver Gazette to preview the Broncos’ game with his beloved Bucs:\nThe Denver Gazette: Big Nasty, tell us about your relationship with Barrel Man.\nKeith Kunzig: “I still miss my boy. I miss Barrel Man (Tim McKernan). God rest his soul. When I was younger — now I’m the old guy and he was the old guy — we were pretty close. He was like a father figure to me. He would tell me, ‘Always keep your family aligned. This stuff takes away from your family.’ He taught me to be involved with the community. That’s the No. 1 priority of us guys who were the so-called ‘face of the franchise’ as ultimate fans. That’s the duty of the Hall of Fame fan as opposed to the drunken idiot on camera. We're about the community. I loved that man. I miss him.”\nDG: How did you meet Barrel Man?\nKunzig: “I still remember when he brought his little semi rig up to Canton (Ohio, home of the Pro Football Hall Fame, where both are enshrined). We sat in the air conditioning. This is way back when they had wooden chairs out in front of the entrance of the Hall. Now it’s like Disney World there. He told me: ‘Keep yourself grounded with this stuff. It ain’t paying your bills.' And he said your memory will go on forever. I just thought the world of him and Becky, his wife. She’s such a sweetheart. We still keep in touch from time to time.”\nDG: How about a good Barrel Man story?\nKunzig: “Oh, he was a normal Joe with a huge heart. Here’s one: I’ve been to Denver one time. I wasn’t expecting anything special. I’m just ‘Big Nasty,’ a mix between Gene Simmons and ‘Psycho Clown.’ Barrel Man was a very humble man. So I go out to Denver and we stayed with a city commissioner. We get in a jacuzzi and we’re having a glass of wine and it was like, ‘Holy crap! This altitude is for real!’ That was a reality check.\n“But when I got to the parking lot at the (Broncos-Bucs) game, I couldn’t believe it. The Denver Marching Band is right there waiting for us. I felt like I was the president. They’re going to Barrel Man’s tailgate and leading the way for us. What hospitality! Then the tailgate was second-to-none. What a great time. The Broncos beat the Bucs. But I can’t say enough about Denver. And it was all because of Barrel Man.”\nDG: How does one become an ultimate fan?\nKunzig: “Well, (Tampa radio station) WDAE, the Sports Animal, had a local mascot back then (36 years ago). We had one that looked like an orange Yosemite Sam. He had more of an impact on me becoming what I became than anything. I was 8 years old and I watched him the entire time instead of watching the game. And it grew into something special (until Big Nasty’s retirement in 2023).”\nDG: What's the job description of an ultimate fan?\nKunzig: “What I’m most proud of is the community involvement. Barrel Man would have told you the same thing. We started a ‘Drugs are Nasty’ program here. We went to elementary schools, middle, high schools. We hit all the schools. We started in a PE class in an elementary school with 15 kids. Then it gets bigger and you had 3,000 kids in an auditorium. If you save one child from steering clear of drugs, we won. And I would have done it for free. It was just like Barrel Man did with me. It’s not about getting drunk on TV. It’s about the community.”\nDG: That cannon on Tampa’s pirate ship scared the heck out of me.\nKunzig: “Funny, that actually happened to my wife. They shot the cannon and my wife jumped. I said what the heck are you jumping for? How long have we been coming here? I think the coolest moments are when the commentators on TV are not expecting it. But we have a great environment for a game. You guys are going to love it.”\nDG: You're the person to ask. How should a Broncos fan spend a gameday in Tampa?\nKunzig: “I’ll give you the skinny. The first thing is you go to the Columbia (Restaurant). It’s Tampa’s swaggy restaurant but not too expensive. Then you go to to Tailgreeter (the website) and visit the Leatherhead Tailgate (outside Raymond James Stadium). They’ll have stogies, a golf simulator, air-conditioned bathrooms, the works. And air-conditioned bathrooms are key here. It’s very fan-friendly; that’s the best part. It’s very first-class. It’s the best tailgate. It’s all about having fun, but family-friendly fun.\n\"Like Barrel Man, it takes Big Nasty an hour to get into the game. Everybody wants to meet you. Now that I'm retired I just go with my family and have a relaxed, fun time.”\nDG: All those years at Bucs games, were you buds with (Colorado Buffaloes assistant coach) Warren Sapp?\nKunzig: “Oh, Warren is a close friend of mine. Take care of Warren for me. Warren is the biggest-hearted individual you’ll ever meet in your life. God bless Deion (Sanders) for making sure Warren got his degree so he can get hired at CU. And that’s his passion, those kids. He’s going to change them. It will take time, but he will change them. He’s all truth. Short story on Warren: the first time I met him, he had his sunglasses on and he’s signing autographs. My wife ran over to him. She wanted to meet him.\n\"Then I said, ‘The Big Nasty meets the Real Big Nasty!’ He goes, ‘Excuse me’? Can’t you see I’m talking to this nice young lady.’ I said, ‘Dog, I know you aren’t trying to pick up my wife!’ And the media goes nuts taking pictures.\n\"To this day we have a great bond. I was just with him on the Buc Cruise with his mom. It’s all Bucs fans and all they want to do is meet Warren Sapp. He was the heartbeat, the swag, everything for our defense. He got me to tears. You guys are blessed to have Warren Sapp at Colorado. That guy’s something special.”\nDG: How do Bucs fans feel about (quarterback) Baker Mayfield?\nKunzig: “Oh, we love Baker. He’s an underdog story. It’s not easy to follow a legend like Tom Brady. But he’s done it. And nobody believed in Baker — nobody. Now, everybody talks about the players. And we have good players. But it’s all about general manager Jason Licht and his front office. That whole front office is amazing. He’s an icon here. He’s hit in every draft. He knows how to find gems. But you know what? It’s all under-the-radar. Nobody gives us any attention nationally. The national media needs to wake up after we beat Detroit (in Week 2). But then Detroit’s ahead of us in the power rankings? What the heck? It’s OK. We know what we have.”\nDG: What’s your prediction for Sunday?\nKunzig: “I’ll go 21-7, Bucs. I’m just saying that because it’s hot as hell here. (Laughs). The other day it was 112 (degrees) on the field. I’m on the front row. The concrete in front of us was steaming, and it wasn’t raining. You pray it doesn’t rain. Then it’s a steam bath.”",

    "text": "Mayfield: It’s time for Boeing to do right by their employees Sep 13, 2024, 6:16 AM (Photo: Jason Redmond, Getty Images) It’s so simple. Treat people well and they will treat you well in return. Boeing, now is your chance to do exactly that and to truly fix a problem more than two decades in the making. The aerospace company used to care deeply about its employees, and for generations, they, in return, cared about the company and put their hearts and souls into the product. It’s why, for so many years, the phrase “if it ain’t Boeing, we ain’t going” truly meant something. More on Boeing’s slogan: If it’s not history, it’s a mystery Then, company leaders decided to move away from the men and women who built the company and their product. Instead, they moved closer to Wall Street. They moved the headquarters. They moved production lines. They moved their loyalty. The thousands of employees left behind — many right here in Washington — tried at first to keep the faith. But each subsequent contract has layered insult on top of injury. Then things started to break. It turns out airplanes safely and reliably fly when they are built by the best employees in the world who are treated like the best employees in the world. When you treat people like trash, and the wind blows … they blow away. More from Travis Mayfield: Set aside today’s trifles and join me at the beach? Well, the winds seem to be shifting … maybe. The people at headquarters are finally moving back. Genuine attention to the production lines is moving back. Now it’s time to move the loyalty back, too. Boeing, now is the time to put your money where your mouth is and tell your machinists they are the best in the world and you want them to help you become the best in the world again too. You may still be Boeing, but they are going unless you finally return some loyalty and genuine respect. Travis Mayfield is a local media personality and fills in as a host on KIRO Newsradio",

    "title": "L.A. Lakers mystique was alive and well in '23 on DraftKings' sportsbook in Ontario.",
    "text": "TORONTO — The Los Angeles Lakers' mystique was alive and well with Ontario bettors.\nThe Lakers, led by superstar LeBron James, were the second-most bet on team on DraftKings' Ontario sportsbook last year. Only the Toronto Blue Jays drew more action.\n\"The Lakers are a popular team, whether it's the U.S., Canada, Germany, Spain, it doesn't matter,\" said Johnny Avello, DraftKings' director of race and sports operations. \"The team has a big following and has for many years because of all the great players that go through their doors.\n\"You go anywhere and you'll see people wearing Lakers shirts.\"\nThe Buffalo Bills -- popular in southern Ontario -- held down third spot. The Toronto Maple Leafs were the only other Canadian franchise to make the cut, standing eighth ahead of basketball's Phoenix Suns and football's New York Jets.\nThe Jays (89-73) finished third in the American League East to qualify for the playoffs. However, they were swept 2-0 by the Minnesota Twins in the AL wildcard series.\nToronto was the most-bet on World Series team, ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. The champion Texas Rangers were fourth.\nToronto slugger Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was the most bet-on player to win the AL MVP, ahead of New York's Aaron Judge and Texas's Corey Seager. But Anaheim's Shohei Ohtani, the fourth pick, was the runaway winner of the award before signing a mega 10-year, US$700-million free-agent deal with the Dodgers.\nAvello wasn't surprised to see the Jays atop the list.\n\"When you look at certain jurisdictions where we are, teams in that jurisdiction are bet on more than others,\" he said. \"So that's no surprise.\"\nThe Toronto Raptors were the seventh-most bet on team to win the NBA crown. The Milwaukee Bucks, Suns and eventual-champion Denver Nuggets held the top three spots.\nNo Raptors were listed as favourites for the NBA's outstanding player award but Hamilton's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder, was the fourth most-bet on individual by handle. Denver's Nikola Jokic, Boston's Jayson Tatum and Dallas's Luka Doncic were the top-three picks.\nToronto's Darko Rajakovic was fourth in betting for the NBA's top coach award. Former Raptors boss Nick Nurse, now with the Philadelphia 76ers, was tops.\nLast month, Gilgeous-Alexander was named The Canadian Press male athlete of the year.\n\"He is a tremendous player and has been for a few years now,\" Avello said. \"It's not unusual that he'd be bet up there because he's certainly one of your top players in the NBA.\"\nSurprisingly, the Cincinnati Bengals were the most bet-on NFL team to win the Super Bowl. Buffalo was second ahead of the San Francisco 49ers (12-4), who've clinched top spot in the NFC.\nBuffalo (10-6) can secure the AFC East for a fourth straight year with a road win Sunday over Miami. The Dolphins (11-5) have already clinched an NFL playoff spot.\n\"I found that (Cincinnati selection) to be a little surprising,\" Avello said. 'Buffalo has always been a top choice because it has had a good, competitive team over the last few years and there's also the proximity to Canada.\n\"But the Bengals have had a good team knocking on the door so I think this was about value . . . going for a double-digit underdog and trying to get a better price for your buck. I don't blame (bettors) because going into the season I thought Cincinnati would also contend for the title but unfortunately when you lose (quarterback) Joe Burrow and a couple of receivers . . . it was just a bad overall year for Cincinnati.\"\nBuffalo quarterback Josh Allen was the third pick for the NFL's most valuable player award behind San Francisco's Brock Purdy and Dallas's Dak Prescott. Lamar Jackson, who has led Baltimore (13-3) to top spot in the AFC and emerged as the favourite to win the honour for a second time, was initially ninth.\nOntario bettors made the Maple Leafs the most bet-on team to win the Stanley Cup. Edmonton was No. 2 ahead of Las Vegas, last year's champion.\nToronto last won the Stanley Cup in 1967.\n\"Toronto has been there, it has had great, outstanding regular-season records, it just hasn't been able to get far enough,\" Avello said. \"I think it (Leafs topping list) should be.\"\nThe Vancouver Canucks were fifth, ahead of the Ottawa Senators (sixth).\nRick Tocchet, in his first full season behind Vancouver's bench, was the top selection to win the Jack Adams Trophy as the NHL's top coach. The Canucks (24-11-3, 51 points) currently top the Pacific Conference.\nPeter Laviolette of the New York Rangers (26-10-1, 53 points) and Mike Sullivan of the Pittsburgh Penguins (19-14-4, 42 points) were the other top two candidates.\n\"Obviously it makes sense that (Tocchet) would get bet,\" Avello said. \"But (Laviolette) is also a good choice and value play.\n\"That was probably bet more toward the beginning of the year so I see that also as a very smart play by bettors.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 5, 2024.\nDan Ralph, The Canadian Press",
