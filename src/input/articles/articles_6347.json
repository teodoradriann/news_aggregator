    "title": "B.C. odour incidents spark questions around corporate ethics and communication",
    "text": "Vancouver resident Robert Ford was heading to a yoga class Sunday morning when he smelled an odour he likened to \"semi-burnt fuel.\"\nAs a member of council at his Kitsilano apartment building, he said he decided to check the boiler room, but it smelled fine.\n\"I was expecting something in there, so that was strange. I scratched my head and I went to the front door, which is right across from the beach, and it was 10 times more powerful outside,\" he said.\nHe immediately began searching online for an explanation but didn't find any answers until almost four hours later.\n\"I'm just kind of perplexed at how we can have such a nasty event with no public information hardly,\" he said.\nIt was one of two acrid odours that spread over parts of Metro Vancouver in less than a week, raising questions about corporate responsibility to inform the public when such events cause widespread concern and confusion but fall short of health and safety breaches.\nThe smell Ford referred to was revealed to be \"an unplanned issue\" with a Parkland fuel refinery processing unit in neighbouring Burnaby. The heavy stench, which Ford compared to jet fuel, blanketed parts of Metro Vancouver and caused more than 100 complaints from local residents.\nIt came just days after a gas leak from a FortisBC natural gas plant in nearby Delta, B.C., prompted criticisms from Mayor George Harvie and numerous residents that the utility didn't notify the public for more than four hours.\nHarvie said the heavy odour caused stress and panic in the community, and a flood of calls to local police and fire departments hampered Delta's emergency response services.\nA statement from Fortis said it was investigating after an elevated level of the odorant added to natural gas was unknowingly sent out in a controlled release of gas.\nCarol Liao, a University of B.C. Sauder fellow at the Dhillon centre for business ethics, said these incidents are not necessarily matters for legislation, but rather about accountability and ethics.\n\"Businesses obviously need to obey bylaws, but they also need to understand that beyond that, there is a need to act responsibly to maintain public trust,\" she said.\n\"If a business is the cause of a terrible odour that's impacting the surrounding community and beyond, it should act as a good corporate citizen and own up to the problem right away, alert public officials, alert those possibly impacted and in harm's way, mitigate the damage and be accountable.\"\nHarvie said he was involved in both incidents as Delta's mayor and as chair of Metro Vancouver's regional district.\n\"The difference between the two was (in) Metro Vancouver, air quality inspectors were on scene at the refinery, so we had more accurate information being fed back to us,\" he said.\nMetro Vancouver monitors emissions of particulates, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide from the Parkland refinery, and the district has said air quality objectives for the contaminants weren't exceeded Sunday.\nBut, Harvie said the Fortis incident was different.\n\"The one from Fortis was very disturbing to me and it does speak a lot about corporate values (and) corporate responsibilities. They kept the information away from us,\" he said. \"This was just unacceptable.\"\nHarvie took to the social media site X after the smell covered an area stretching from the Tsawwassen ferry terminal to more than 30 kilometres away in Vancouver. The mayor said he had contacted FortisBC requesting an urgent followup meeting.\nThe Fortis statement released on Wednesday said work was being performed on new equipment, which was not connected to the gas system, and while a controlled release of gas was planned, the release of odour was not.\n\"Further review is underway to determine why there was an elevated level of odorant in the equipment,\" it said.\n\"Although the controlled release of gas at the interconnect station on Jan. 16 contained an elevated level of this odorant, it is not harmful and there are no immediate or long-term health effects.\"\nFortis said it had been in contact with local First Nations, municipal and emergency officials, including Harvie, as well as government regulators, to provide information on its response.\n\"We have also started a review of the incident and are working with relevant stakeholders during this process.\"\nKevin Farrow, technical director of Parkland, said in an interview that the refinery had paused processing operations earlier this month due to extreme cold weather.\n\"It was during that restart of the refinery, that one of the processing units had a plugged line, which ultimately led to the plume and odour that many experienced on Sunday,\" he said. \"We've launched a review to better understand the root cause of what happened and how we got into this situation.\"\nParkland had issued an advisory on its website two days before the plume, alerting people who live nearby that they may notice noise and \"higher than usual flare\" from the facility.\nIn a timeline created by the refinery and sent to The Canadian Press, the company said the incident happened around 7:30 a.m. Sunday.\nIt said Metro Vancouver had been notified by 8:30 a.m., and by 9 a.m., the Burnaby Fire Department and the RCMP had created a perimeter around the facility as a safety precaution. The RCMP was called off at 11:26 a.m., while the fire department remained in place until 3:15 p.m., the timeline said.\nThe refinery's first public statement Sunday was issued at 11 a.m., notifying the public of an incident that cause elevated smoke, odours and particulate matter. That was followed up at 12:30 p.m. with a media advisory, announcing the shut down of operations.\nWhile some, including Ford in Kitsilano, believe communication needs to come sooner to alleviate panic, Farrow said the \"priority\" of the refinery is to \"communicate accurate and confirmed information to the public.\"\n\"We have that information now,\" he said. \"We understand more, and we've begun to reach out to our community partners and to our neighbours, (and) you can expect a lot more information from the refinery in the coming days and weeks.\"\nFarrow noted the refinery remains shut down but the company announced it would be conducting a \"controlled and necessary operational procedure\" on Thursday.\n\"We do not expect any impacts of the community. We're just making them aware, just in case anything were to occur,\" Farrow said.\nMetro Vancouver also issued an updated air quality bulletin Wednesday night, saying it \"will be closely monitoring\" as the refinery conducts the operation \"that may result in odour, smoke and flaring.\"\nWhile some residents expressed concern about the announcement online, Liao applauded the move, saying an advanced public statement can be \"immensely helpful in ensuring transparency and accountability to the surrounding communities.\"\n\"It helps avoid any public confusion and the tying up of resources such as 911 calls, while also mitigating risk,\" she said.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 25, 2024.\nBrieanna Charlebois, The Canadian Press",

    "title": "'Egg Beater' Solution for Deep-Ocean Wind Turbines: UTD Team Advances New Design With Nearly $8M From DOE",
    "text": "Massive, long-bladed wind turbines are anchored to the shallow sea floor of countries around the world, especially in Northern Europe and China. The U.S. has been slower to adopt the technology due to costs, local opposition, and regulatory/supply chain hurdles. But a different solution could move wind farms further out into the sea, changing the game entirely. And a team of UT Dallas researchers is hot on the trail.\nOne big difference: Their proposed turbine looks more like an egg beater than a traditional windmill.\n“Our turbine is designed to make offshore wind power safe, efficient and affordable,” says UTD Professor Dr. Todd Griffith, whose lab contains a 6-foot-tall, small-scale prototype of what could eventually become a 900-foot-tall upside egg beater floating far above the deep ocean floor. If successful, the technology could capture “untapped potential energy” from wind blowing across deep ocean water, the university said.\nGriffith and his team of UTD engineers recently put the prototype through extensive testing to show that it works.\nThe next big test? Scaling it up as high as 500 feet tall to prove it works in a real-world situation. Ultimately, the offshore turbine could reached the stunning height of 900 feet—as tall as a 72-story skyscraper—generating electricity from winds over the deep ocean “miles from the coast and out of view from land,” UTD said.\nUTD researchers tested their prototype at the University of Maine, which has a facility that can simulate wind and wave conditions.[Photo: UTD]\nTexas already leads the U.S. in wind energy It’s not surprising that this research is happening in North Texas. The Lone Star State leads the nation in wind energy, with 19,000 wind turbines spinning away as of September 2024, according to the U.S. Wind Turbine Database.\nGriffith calls his team’s work “important” for enabling energy independence and reliability for Texas, which has made it a priority to increase the capacity of the electricity grid.\n“In the U.S., we have a major opportunity to develop offshore wind energy systems that can enhance energy capacity to the power grid in coastal areas,” Griffith said in a statement. “To access wind energy in deep ocean water, however, we need a different solution. Our turbine is designed to make offshore wind power safe, efficient and affordable.”\nNearly $8 million in ATLANTIS program grants The professor of mechanical engineering in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science recently received a $4.42 million research grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to advance the project, extending a 2019 grant of $3.3 million grant awarded in 2019 for a total DOE investment of $7.72 million.\nThe Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) award is part of the Aerodynamic Turbines, Lighter and Afloat, with Nautical Technologies and Integrated Servo-control (ATLANTIS) program, which aims to develop new and potentially disruptive innovations in floating offshore technology.\nThe research is not tied to any existing offshore wind energy farms, UTD noted.\nMore on the ‘vertical axis wind turbine design’ Griffith joined UTD in 2017, eight years after he began investigating vertical-axis wind turbine designs as a principal member of the technical staff and offshore technical lead at Sandia National Laboratories’ Wind Energy Technologies Department.\nHis design features a vertical axis of rotation that’s very different from traditional three-blade horizontal-axis turbines. The turbine sits on a platform partly above and partly below the ocean’s surface and is attached to the sea floor with cables. Unlike traditional turbines, the generator and controls are at the water level in the platform. UTD said this provides greater stability and facilitating maintenance, with a cable along the sea floor delivering electricity to the land.\nWeighing just 10 pounds, the prototype is made with composite materials. When wind pushes against the prototype’s blades, they rotate to create a twisting force, or torque, that generates electricity.\nAlong with focusing on lightness, the team is even more focused on safety.\n“We’re developing a new safety system to protect the turbine in high-wind conditions, including bringing the turbine to a stop if necessary,” Griffith said.\nOne of several UTD Wind projects UTD’s wind tunnel, the Boundary Layer and Subsonic Wind Tunnel. [Image: UTD]\nGriffith’s deep-ocean wind turbine project is one of several research initiatives based in UTD’s Wind Energy Center, also known as UTD Wind. Griffith serves as deputy director for UTD Wind, which is dedicated to the advancement of wind energy science and engineering.\nIn November, Dallas Innovates wrote about a UTD assistant professor, Dr. Yaqing Jin, who was inspired by seal whiskers to help develop a sensor to monitor turbulence in the deep ocean, which can damage wind turbines under operation.\nIn addition research like Griffith’s and Jin’s, UTD Wind also provides opportunities to train future wind energy experts, including a growing number of students interested in the energy industry.\nGriffith’s project involves collaborations with other universities as well, including the University of Maine, where the UTD team tested their prototyp at a research facility that can simulate wind and wave conditions. The researchers are also testing their design in UT Dallas’ own wind tunnel, called the Boundary Layer and Subsonic Wind Tunnel.\nDr. Mario Rotea, director of UTD Wind and professor of mechanical engineering, said the DOE grants for Griffith’s project will continue to support student researchers, some of whom have gone on to work in the wind energy industry.\n“We’re pleased to play a role in advancing wind power generation through our research at UTD Wind,” Rotea, an expert in control systems and a collaborator on the offshore turbine project, said in a statement.",
