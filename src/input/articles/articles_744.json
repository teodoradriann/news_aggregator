The head of the lone research centre on Lord Ram said that no one ever imagined that Ayodhya, which has been neglected for the past 20 years, would take the form of such a 'big city'. \"Unimaginable. We had never thought that Ayodhya, which has been neglected for the past 20 years, would take the form of such a big city today. I think that Ayodhya will be the biggest site of Hindutva at the international level,\" Ajay Pratap Singh said on the consecration ceremony of Lord Ram Temple here on January 22. The research centre, also known as Ram Shodh Peeth, in the temple city's Rammanohar Lohia Avadh University, was established in 2001 and it works to unearthen any fact about Lord Ram hidden in history.

    "title": "Musk adds Microsoft to OpenAI lawsuit, accusing them of an AI monopoly",
    "text": "Elon Musk has amended a lawsuit against OpenAI to name Microsoft as a defendant, calling their partnership a \\\"de facto merger\\\" and accusing them of anticompetitive practices. The lawsuit, filed Thursday, also names Reid Hoffman, a Microsoft board member and former OpenAI board member, as a defendant. It also names Musk's startup, xAI, and Shivon Zilis, the mother of three of his children, as plaintiffs. Zilis was previously an OpenAI board member and is now an executive at Neuralink, Musk's brain implant company. The complaint accuses OpenAI and Microsoft of creating an AI monopoly and engaging in \\\"intensified\\\" anticompetitive practices, citing \\\"lavish compensation\\\" offers as one example. Lawyers for Musk said in the amended complaint, filed at a federal court in Northern California, that \\\"OpenAI has attempted to starve competitors of AI talent by aggressively recruiting employees with offers of lavish compensation, and is on track to spend $1.5 billion on personnel for just 1,500 employees.\\\"Bloomberg previously reported that some OpenAI employees are making up to $800,000 a year, which can include bonuses and stock awards. It also said that most OpenAI engineering roles pay between $200,000 and $370,000, according to job postings it reviewed.Musk's lawyers said that the defendants \\\"possess a nearly 70% share of the generative AI market, constituting a monopoly, or, in the alternative, an attempt or conspiracy to monopolize the generative AI market.\\\"The suit describes Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI as a \\\"de facto merger\\\" and said, \\\"Microsoft is now OpenAI, and OpenAI, Microsoft.\\\" It refers to a New York Times report from last month, which says Microsoft AI chief Mustafa Suleyman is among a group of Microsoft employees who work from OpenAI's San Francisco office.The amended lawsuit is the latest escalation between longtime rivals Musk and Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI. Musk first sued OpenAI and cofounders Altman and Greg Brockman in March, accusing the company of jeopardizing its nonprofit mission by partnering with Microsoft, which has invested more than $13 billion into the startup. OpenAI responded to the suit by calling it \\\"incoherent\\\" and \\\"contradictory.\\\"Musk, who helped create OpenAI in 2015, then dropped his lawsuit without explanation. He filed the latest suit in August, arguing that OpenAI had abandoned its founding mission to develop AI that is beneficial for humanity by putting commercial interests first, and claimed that he was \\\"deceived\\\" into cofounding the company. OpenAI said in September that it is moving to a for-profit governance structure. The current lawsuit claims that OpenAI acted in an anticompetitive manner by asking investors in its most recent funding round not to invest in competitors, including Musk's startup xAI. The suit references a report from the Financial Times in October, which said this was one of the terms asked of potential investors for the $6.6 billion funding round that was closed last month. As part of that round, SoftBank committed $500 million to OpenAI. Navneet Govil, chief financial officer of SoftBank's Vision Funds previously told Business Insider that SoftBank still has the ability to invest in other AI companies. Govil told BI's Hasan Chowdhury, \\\"Our view is if it's a disruptive company and the addressable market is large, there's room for more than one player.\\\"Microsoft, OpenAI, and Hoffman didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider, made outside normal working hours. In September, Hoffman called Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI a case of \\\"sour grapes.\\\"",

    "text": "身体3个部位发麻，可能是脑梗信号\n本文转自【人民日报】\n许多人都体验过“麻木”的感觉，比如蹲久了腿发麻、胳膊压久了发麻等。生活中，大多数的麻是无害的，缓一缓就好了，但有的麻木可能是脑梗的早期征兆。\n受访专家\n首都医科大学三博脑科医院神经外科主任医师 刘方军中山大学附属第三医院神经内科副主任医师 魏磊\n3个部位发麻当心脑梗\n脑梗又称缺血性脑卒中，俗称中风，是由于脑部血管阻塞，导致血液不能流入大脑，造成脑组织缺氧。\n脑梗发病迅速，病情险恶，发作前常会通过身体传递出一些异常信号，以下3个部位发麻，就要引起注意，及时就医。\n1 舌头发麻\n舌头是大脑的先行器官，舌神经连接着大脑。脑梗会影响支配语言和吞咽的神经，导致舌部运动异常。\n脑供血不足时，支配舌头运动功能的神经失灵，常见症状之一是舌头发麻、发硬，突然说话不灵或吐字不清，甚至不会说话。\n2 面部发麻\n面部神经与脑部血管紧密相连，当脑部供血不足时，面部神经可能受到影响，导致面部发麻。\n由于面部神经的受损，患者的脸部表情可能不再对称，导致一侧脸部的表情不协调或不自然。\n如果发麻症状频繁出现，且伴有口眼歪斜、流口水等症状，应高度警惕脑梗的风险。\n3 单侧肢体麻木\n人体四肢的运动和感觉功能都是由大脑控制的，当相关大脑皮层供血不足时，会出现四肢运动或感觉障碍，最常见的表现是手脚发麻。\n脑梗后，由于一侧头部神经受压迫，身体一侧会突然发麻不适。如果手脚麻木出现在一侧肢体，而另一侧完全正常，就可能是脑卒中的先兆。\n脑血管病的麻，有4个特点\n首都医科大学三博脑科医院神经外科主任医师刘方军介绍，因脑血管病造成的麻木，通常有以下几个特点。\n麻木感突然发生\n麻木的发生可能没有任何预兆，可在静息状态下产生，也可能在运动或生气时产生，还有一些在夜间突然发生。\n多为单侧麻木\n如果梗塞灶较小，只损害了管理感觉功能的神经组织，就会造成对侧躯体某一部位的麻木或半身麻木。如果是短暂性脑供血不足，只会引起阵发性麻木。\n随着缺血性脑组织的进一步扩展，病变动脉闭塞的程度也会加重，对侧躯体、面部的麻木可由局部扩展到半身，由短暂性麻木演变为持续性麻木。\n症状跟体位姿势无关\n有些颈椎病、腰椎病也会让人产生麻木感，但这种麻木是由于神经受压迫所致，有时体位改变，压迫解除，麻木即可暂时缓解或消失。\n脑血管病麻木则与体位变化没关系，不会因为体位改变而消失，不过部分患者的麻木感持续一段时间后，可能会逐渐自行缓解。\n往往伴有其他症状\n除麻木外，脑血管病患者大多伴有肢体软弱无力、头晕、头痛、视力障碍 (视物模糊或复视等）、记忆减退（尤其是近期记忆下降），以及血压增高或偏低等现象。突然眩晕、呕吐、耳鸣、站立不稳也是脑血管病的先兆。\n脑梗有5个“祸根”\n脑梗死的危险因素包括年龄、性别、遗传背景等不可控因素，以及高血压、糖尿病、高血脂、吸烟、心房颤动、不良生活方式等可控因素。后者在日常生活中应积极控制。\n久坐不动\n久坐不动会减缓血液循环，增加血液黏稠度，使代谢废物和脂质更易在血管壁沉积，进而形成斑块，甚至引发血栓。\n建议白天每坐1小时就起身活动5分钟，养成规律运动的习惯，促进血液流动，减少血管“污垢”堆积。\n高盐高油\n高盐饮食会使体内钠离子过多，导致血压升高、血管内皮受损；高油食物则会让血液中的胆固醇和甘油三酯飙升，脂肪在血管壁沉积。\n建议每日盐摄入不超过5克，提倡适宜人群使用低钠盐；少吃油炸食品，用橄榄油替代动物油。\n情绪波动\n生气、焦虑会使身体释放大量肾上腺素等应激激素，导致血管收缩、血压飙升。这种变化易使高血压、糖尿病等危险因素恶化；长期情绪波动还会损伤血管内皮，加速动脉粥样硬化。\n平时可通过深呼吸、冥想等方式缓解压力，避免血管反复经历“过山车式”的情绪刺激。\n夜间打鼾\n严重打鼾，医学上称为睡眠呼吸暂停，会导致夜间反复缺氧，血液黏稠度增加，心脏被迫加倍工作泵血，易诱发高血压、心脏病。长期缺氧会损伤血管内皮细胞，诱发心脑血管血栓形成。\n若出现明显的夜间打鼾，建议调整睡姿，避免仰卧，并尽早就医检查。\n烟不离手\n吸烟不光损害呼吸系统，增加癌症风险，烟草中的尼古丁还会直接损伤血管内皮，诱发慢性炎症反应，加速动脉硬化。\n研究显示，吸烟者发生卒中的风险是不吸烟者的2~3.5倍。吸烟者的家人吸二手烟，同样显著增加心脑血管病风险。\n建议积极戒烟，必要时通过药物或行为干预来科学戒烟。\n(来源:生命时报)",

    "title": "Mazhar Farooqui on new book 'The Maz Files', investigative journalism and dealing with threats - News | Khaleej Times",
    "text": "Growing up in the ‘City of Nawabs,’ a place that has long nurtured poets and writers, Mazhar Farooqui’s childhood was filled with colourful stories of history, heritage, and, of course—Lucknowi Rogan Josh. At the time, little did Maz know that his journey, which began with freelancing for newspapers as a teenager, would eventually lead him to become one of the foremost investigative journalists in the UAE.\nNow, turning a new leaf in his story, Mazhar has come up with his first book, The Maz Files: Scoops, Scams, and Showdowns , recounting moments of his adrenaline-filled career, forever etched in his memory. His advice for aspiring journalists? Perseverence. “Stick with it, no matter how tough it gets,” the journalist-turned-author tells Khaleej Times, as he opens up about his formative years, the turning point that led him into investigative journalism, and the principles he holds steadfast when chasing a story.\nEdited excerpts from an interview:\nQ. Tell us a bit about your formative years?\nI grew up in Lucknow, a north Indian city rich in history and known for its food. My family was in the construction business, but my passion was always writing. As a teenager, I freelanced for local newspapers, though I didn’t initially see journalism as a career.\nQ. Why did you decide to become an investigative journalist?\nI chose this path for two reasons. First, I was eager to tackle the challenge of uncovering hidden truths. At the time, many newspapers were content with superficial coverage, avoiding deep dives into crucial issues. My resolve was further strengthened in the early ’90s during a wave of communal violence in my city. Seeing the media distort the truth firsthand made me vow to be a journalist committed to revealing the real story, rather than just repeating the narratives handed to me.\nQ. Do you think it’s tougher to be an investigative journalist in the UAE? If yes, why?\nInvestigative journalism presents challenges worldwide, but in the UAE, there are additional complexities. Unlike in many countries where defamation typically results in civil penalties, here it is treated as a criminal offence, with potential fines, imprisonment, or both. Additionally, UAE law prohibits taking photographs or videos of individuals without their consent.\nNavigating these stringent regulations requires investigative journalists to strike a delicate balance between conducting in-depth reporting and complying with legal standards. However, it’s worth noting that UAE courts have generally been understanding and assess cases with an emphasis on intent.\nQ. What are the principles that you will never compromise on when going after a story?\nNever compromising on truthfulness and accuracy. Integrity is a must; I adhere to ethical practices and honesty. I ensure fairness by presenting all sides and respecting privacy, while also safeguarding the confidentiality of my sources. If the story is in the public interest, I focus on revealing vital information while still upholding these principles.\nAt a book launch event with veteran journalist Kaveree Bamzai; the book has been published by Westland\nQ. Talk us through your process — once you have a tip, how do you go about your story?\nThere isn’t a fixed formula, but I stick to some core principles. First, I validate the tip by checking the credibility of the source and cross-referencing details with other reliable information. Next, I dive into thorough research to gather background and context, which can take a few days. Many stories need on-the-ground investigation and legwork, so I’m often out knocking on doors. After that, I develop a plan for interviews and further investigation, aiming to uncover more evidence and perspectives. I avoid sting operations unless they’re absolutely necessary. I sift through the often overwhelming amount of information, focusing on crucial details and presenting the story in a clear and engaging way for readers.\nQ. You’ve had some close calls; what’s the most harrowing incident over your career?\nThe most harrowing incident occurred when threats extended to my family. Individuals not only targeted me but explicitly included my daughters in their threats, posting openly on social media that we were on their hit list. This malicious campaign lasted several weeks, with abusive and threatening messages flooding my email and WhatsApp. They even released the addresses of my parents and my daughter, who was studying in another city, urging others to act against them. It was an incredibly disturbing experience.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Westland Books (@westland_books)\nQ. What made you decide to write The Maz Files: Scoops, Scams and Showdowns now? Is there to be a part two?\nMy journey as an investigative journalist has been filled with intense experiences — sweat, threats, and legal battles. It was the right time to share these stories. The book takes readers on a wild adventure, from chasing conmen and narrowly escaping dangerous situations to forming unexpected friendships with figures like the late MF Husain and creating conflicts with celebrities like Michael Jackson. It also features insightful essays on 13 of the devious characters I’ve exposed.\nLooking ahead, my next project is tentatively titled Maaz and Myra . I’m collaborating with Dr. Amina Mahmood, a writer from Pakistan whom I’ve never met in person— we communicate solely through WhatsApp and emails. Set in Dubai, the book is a romantic thriller about an Indian journalist and a fiercely ambitious Pakistani woman. To be clear: this story has no connection to my personal experiences.\nQ. What are some lessons you’ve learned along your career?\nThere have been many, and I’m still learning. One big takeaway is that being thorough is essential. Building strong relationships and sticking with them are crucial too. Integrity? Absolutely non-negotiable. I’ve also realised that you’re only as good as your last story.\nQ. What’s your biggest accomplishment in life?\nMy biggest accomplishment has been driving legal action against over 250 individuals, many of whom are now behind bars. However, my work goes beyond scam busting. I've also played a role in reuniting families.\nQ. What’s your favourite part about the book?\nIt’s the chapter where I describe my showdown with Michael Jackson. You’ll have to read the book to get the full story!\nQ. Advice for others wanting to become investigative journalists?\nIf you’re just toying with the idea, you might want to rethink it. It’s not as glamorous as it sounds — it's hard work and involves significant risks. But if you’re committed, my only piece of advice is perseverance. Stick with it, no matter how tough it gets.\nThe Maz Files is available on Amazon.ae",
