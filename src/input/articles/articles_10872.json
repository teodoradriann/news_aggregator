Puppies have a great deal of curiosity and energy. So you will need to be watchful and patient. They also need to be taught all doggie behaviors from leash walking to potty training to crate training. However, on the plus side, puppies generally do not have trauma and therefore behavioral issues that you must overcome. I often write about dogs who have been in hoarding situations or have been left behind by their owners. Those issues can leave scars. Puppies are less likely to have long-term scars due to their age. And there is one dachshund and chihuahua mix puppy (also known as a Chiweenie) in Florida who is looking for a loving home.\n[Florida ·](/florida)11h\n[ · Followuser · 3.2K followers](https://www.newsbreak.com/robbie-newport-1602272)\nRobbie Newport\nOpinion: The light of the body is the eye\nThe King James Version Bible has a wonderful way of using words to express God’s thoughts through the Holy Spirit.

    "title": "Steven Kwan, Guardians bats disappear in 3-0 loss to Tigers",
    "text": "By Mac Robinson ,\n28 minutes ago\nCLEVELAND, OH - Missing in action might be the best way to describe the Cleveland Guardians (61-41) offense during the month of July, punctuated by its latest 3-0 loss to the Detroit Tigers (51-53). While it has been a strength for the team throughout the season, the Guardians have scored two or less runs in half of the team's games in July.\nThroughout July entering Thursday's game against the Tigers, all four of the Guardians all-star hitters had batting averages below .280: Steven Kwan (.276), Jose Ramirez (.240), Josh Naylor (.215), and David Fry (.200).\nWhile the team's offense has had its fair share of scuffles this month, Guardians manager Stephen Vogt doesn't think the team is in a funk at the plate.\nWe were playing good baseball,” Vogt said in his postgame press conference. “I think we've had games where we scored and games where we haven't, but I wouldn't call it a funk. I would just say we've lost more games than we won the last couple of weeks. For our guys, I think I like our at-bats. I like where we are. Everybody needs to relax and be themselves.”\nIf there is a bright side to the recent skid, it's that the trade deadline is less than a week away and the team has time to adjust and potentially make some moves to help bolster the lineup for the stretch run and potentially the playoffs. Guardians president of baseball operations Chris Antonetti is already surveying the trade market, which you can read more about here .\nStanding Tall\nGuardians starting pitcher Gavin Williams might have gotten the loss, but his outing against the Tigers was more than meets the eye in the statline.\nThe young right-hander threw a season-high six innings and 105 pitches total, 76 of which were strikes. Both were the most in a start for Williams since his September 17, 2023 start against the Texas Rangers.\nWhile he gave up his first home run of the season to Tigers shortstop Javier Baez in the second inning, he was immediately able to lock in afterwards. Three of the final 12 hitters Williams faced did not see more than five pitches in an at-bat. He also threw 13 pitches or less in three of the next four innings.\nWilliams, 24, finished the day allowing six hits, two walks, and those three runs from Baez's home run, while striking out nine Tigers.\nThe Guardians will need more impressive outings from Williams and fellow young starting pitcher Tanner Bibee as the season continues.\nWhat's next?\nThe Guardians will turn to right-handed pitcher Ben Lively (8-6, 3.57) to face-off against the Philadelphia Phillies in the City of Brotherly Love on Friday night. First pitch from Citizens Bank Park will come at 6:40 PM.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open. Fewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions. Warmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan. In Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas. On Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain. Warm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each. Mount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow. James Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season. \"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said. \"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\" Apex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls. Shalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow. \"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\" At Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open. Several resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit. \"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled. Environment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland. Proctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\" He said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior. But Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations. \"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.

    "text": "Ring will no longer allow police to request doorbell camera footage from users [Amazon](https://www.foxla.com/tag/organization/amazon)-owned Ring will stop allowing police departments to request doorbell camera footage from users, marking an end to a feature that has drawn criticism from privacy advocates. In a blog post on Wednesday, Ring said it will sunset the \"Request for Assistance\" tool, which allows police departments and other public safety agencies to request and receive video captured by the doorbell cameras through Ring’s Neighbors app. The company did not provide a reason for the change, which will be effective starting this week. Eric Kuhn, the head of Neighbors, said in the announcement that law enforcement agencies will still be able to make public posts in the Neighbors app. [Police and other agencies](https://www.foxla.com/tag/crime-publicsafety) can also still use the app to \"share helpful safety tips, updates, and community events,\" Kuhn said. The update is the latest restriction Ring has made to police activity on the Neighbors app following concerns raised by privacy watchdogs about the company’s relationship with police departments across the country. Critics have stressed the proliferation of these relationships – and users’ ability to report what they see as suspicious behavior - can change neighborhoods into a place of constant surveillance and lead to more instances of racial profiling. In a bid to increase transparency, Ring changed its policy in 2021 to make police requests publicly visible through its Neighbors app. Previously, law enforcement agencies were able to send Ring owners who lived near an area of an active investigation private emails requesting video footage. \"Now, Ring hopefully will altogether be out of the business of platforming casual and warrantless police requests for footage to its users,\" Matthew Guariglia, a senior policy analyst at the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation, said in a statement on Wednesday. Law enforcement agencies can still access videos using a search warrant. Ring also maintains the right to share footage without user consent in limited circumstances. In mid-2022, Ring disclosed it handed over 11 videos to police without notifying users that year due to \"exigent or emergency\" circumstances, one of the categories that allow it to share videos without permission from owners. However, Guariglia, of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the group remains skeptical about the ability of police and the company to determine what is or is not an emergency. Last summer, Ring agreed to pay $5.8 million to settle with the Federal Trade Commission over allegations that the company let employees and contractors access user videos. Furthermore, the agency said Ring had inadequate security practices, which allowed hackers to control consumer accounts and cameras. The company disagrees with those claims.",
