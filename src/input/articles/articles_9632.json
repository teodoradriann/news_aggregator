    "text": "Desde la madrugada del miércoles hasta las 10:45 de hoy, cerca de 180 soldados de la Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (Sedena) y 500 elementos de la Guardia Nacional (GN) irrumpieron sorpresivamente en las instalaciones del Centro Federal de Readaptación Social “El Altiplano”, en el municipio de Almoloya de Juárez, donde se encuentran recluidos delincuentes como Rafael Caro Quintero o José Antonio Yépez Ortíz \"El Marro\". Hasta ahora se conoce que las acciones de cateo en la prisión tienen como objetivo revisar cada una de las celdas de máxima seguridad, así como aquellas de los procesados, sentenciados o no, que se encuentran alojados en el inmueble federal. Te podría interesar La revisión comenzó tras la llegada de más de 500 elementos del Ejército Mexicano, del Servicio de Protección Federal, de la Guardia Penitenciaria y de la Guardia Nacional. Buscaron aparatos de comunicación como celulares, sustancias estupefacientes y armas, ya fuera de fuego o punzocortantes hechizas, pero de acuerdo con el último corte, no encontraron nada. El operativo fue exhaustivo, incluso al personal del Altiplano se les impidió el acceso durante el cambio de turno para evitar alguna anomalía y también se les aplicaron los protocolos de revisión. Fue alrededor de las 09:00 horas cuando ingresaron quienes laboran en el penal de máxima seguridad; sin embargo, el movimiento por parte de las fuerzas se mantuvo más de dos horas después. ¿Quiénes habitan el Altiplano? El penal de máxima seguridad, de donde logró fugarse Joaquín “El Chapo Guzmán” en 2015 mediante un túnel que cavaron desde una propiedad privada, alberga a varios de los capos más peligrosos del país. Líderes de distintos cárteles como Eduardo Arellano Félix, 'El Doctor': ex-líder del cártel de Tijuana, es uno de los hermanos Arellano Félix y fundador de esta agrupación delictiva. También está Luis Cárdenas Palomino, exjefe de la desaparecida Policía Federal y brazo derecho del exsecretario de Seguridad, Genaro García Luna; acusado de tortura. De los más antiguos inquilinos del Altiplano es Daniel Arizmendi, 'El Mochaorejas': secuestrador que operó en la Ciudad de México en los años noventa y que era famoso por mutilar las orejas. Mientras que, entre los más recientes ingresados resaltan José Alberto, alias 'La Kena', presunto líder de la célula delictiva \"Los Ciclones\", perteneciente al Cártel del Golfo; y Nestor Isidro Pérez Salas, alias ‘El Nini’, presunto jefe de seguridad de ‘Los Chapitos’. El operativo en el Altiplano De acuerdo con información del Órgano Administrativo Desconcentrado Prevención y Readaptación Social (OADPRS) la noche del miércoles y durante la madrugada de este jueves se realizaron acciones de rutina para detectar objetos y sustancias no permitidas en el Centro Federal de Readaptación Social (Cefereso) de Almoloya de Juárez; sin embargo, no se trata de una acción común. Debido al gran despliegue operativo, incluso comenzaron rumores de un motín al interior del Altiplano, lo que fue descartado por autoridades en la zona. Se reportó que la vida al interior del penal se mantiene bajo control y en normalidad. VGB",

    "text": "ROCK ISLAND, Ill. — So often, life can be like a river. It twists and turns -- many times, in ways you could never expect. But if we're lucky, we'll end up exactly where we're meant to be. And we would say Jeff O'Hern is one of the lucky ones. \"Yeah, that's what I do. I make the boats here,\" said O'Hern. He's the hands that craft [Navarro Canoe Co.'s](https://www.navarrocanoe.com/) handcrafted canoes. 2024 will mark 50 years since Navarro first began building boats in Navarro, California. Over the decades it's changed locations to four different states as owners come and go. 12 years ago, the owner at the time brought Navarro to downtown Rock Island. Then two years ago, it changed hands again. It was then, in 2022, that O'Hern began a brand new journey. He was asked to become Navarro's master craftsman, despite not having any experience or formal training on how to build canoes. \"It's a working retirement for me, which is fun,\" O'Hern said. Navarro is hosting a ['Meet Your Makers' event](https://www.navarrocanoe.com/makers) to bring you a behind the scenes look at the shop, and O'Hern's work, on April 20-21. More information on how to RSVP for the event is at the bottom of this article. It takes him about 100 manhours to complete each canoe. He cuts and shapes the wood, creates the fiberglass shell from molds he helped build, adds protective Kevlar lining and carefully pieces it all together. Right now, O'Hern is cranking out about two to three canoes each month, for customers all over the country and even some international buyers in Japan. But if you ask O'Hern, he wasn't worried about his lack of training. After all, he says his whole life has prepared him for this moment. From high school through his 50s, O'Hern worked as a youth outreach pastor as well as a football coach at Moline High School. \"You don't get paid much for that work, so I tended to have side jobs,\" O'Hern laughed. He grew up in a construction-oriented family; his grandmother loved antiques and taught him about finishes; during college, O'Hern lived in Florida and learned how to work with fiberglass while making surfboards; he also had experience painting over the years. When he was asked to take over canoe building by the two new co-owners of Navarro, O'Hern thought it would be a perfect fit. \"God is provisional. It's that simple,\" O'Hern smiled. \"I could see myself doing this until I no longer exist.\" While he jokingly calls this his retirement job, O'Hern certainly puts in the hours. He averages anywhere from 50 to 70 hours at the shop. During that first year, he even kept a cot at Navarro so he could be ready to go when the canoe's resin was dry. \"This is a great-- I don't want to say end, but this is a great final job to have,\" O'Hern said. And it turns out it took him reaching the end to find his way back to the beginning. O'Hern grew up on the Rock River and remembers canoeing as a child. When he was too young to drive, he would have to walk two and a half miles up to the bridge, then down over and around to the mall to wait for the bus. \"So instead, after dad left for work so he didn't know we were doing it, we'd get in the canoe, paddle straight across river, take three minutes and tie up the canoe under the viaduct by the mall and get on the bus,\" O'Hern laughed. \"And at the end of the day, get back to the canoe to go home, but you had to beat dad!\" Every Navarro canoe is customized to the customer's preference. From the wood types, grains and stains to the color of the fiberglass shell wrapped around the canoe. Many customers even get logos, names, initials or other designs imprinted onto the wood. Navarro canoes can range from $5,000 to $8,000. They're also much lighter than your typical 100-pound canoe, instead weighing in at around 50 pounds. \"When these canoes retire, they don't go to landfills. They go to estates, is how we like to put it,\" said Todd McGreevy, one of Navarro's co-owners. Navarro's canoes are built to last. They're also made to be a much smoother ride than other boats on the market. \"The ribs give them a flexibility. The canoes breath in the water. Versus an aluminum boat, which kind of-- when the water comes up, it gets kind of loud and slaps against the sides. These, when you sit down, you literally feel it breathing and gliding through the water,\" McGreevy said. He also noted that Navarro would not be what it is without O'Hern's master craftsmanship. We asked O'Hern if he thought of himself as an artist, as many people would consider his work a piece of floating art. He got emotional at the thought. \"Anything that you make with your hands and craft is art, isn't it? I think so. Yeah, I'm thankful when someone calls it art or just hangs it on the wall. Makes me feel pretty good,\" O'Hern said. But while we would call the boats art, to O'Hern, they're really about joy. \"It's all joy. I get pure satisfaction from building a canoe. There's nothing better than working with your hands. It makes me feel valid. And as you age, you can find yourself feeling like you're not important anymore. And this gives me... yeah,\" O'Hern said, choking up. \"Thank you to the maker for making me a maker.\" You can get a behind-the-scenes look at Navarro Canoe Co. and O'Hern's work at the shop's 'Meet Your Makers' event on April 20 and 21. Guests will enjoy pizza, beverages and a personal tour through the facility by O'Hern and the rest of the team. RSVPs are required for this event.

    "text": "By Advance Local Weather Alerts A report was issued from the National Weather Service on Friday at 5:29 a.m. for strong thunderstorms until 5:45 a.m. for Delaware County.\nWind gusts of up to 40 mph and marble-sized hail (0.5 inches) are expected.\n\"At 5:28 a.m., Doppler radar tracked a strong thunderstorm near Shehawken, or 15 miles south of Deposit, moving northeast at 45 mph,\" says the weather service. \"Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects. Minor hail damage to vegetation is possible.\"\nLocations impacted by the alert include Hancock, Shehawken, Starlight, Equinunk, Orson, Lake Como, Preston Park and Lakewood.\nAccording to the weather service, \"If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.\"\nWhen lightning looms: Expert safety tips for thunderstorms Lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times each year, with the bulk of these electrical discharges occurring during the summer months. Tragically, lightning claims the lives of about 20 individuals annually, as reported by the weather service. The risk of lightning-related incidents escalates as thunderstorms draw near, reaching its peak when the storm directly looms overhead. However, it gradually recedes as the tempest moves away.\nTo guarantee your safety in the midst of a thunderstorm, take into account the following recommendations:\nLightning safety plan:\nWhen venturing outdoors, it's crucial to have a lightning safety plan in place. Monitor the sky for threatening signs and listen for the sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it's an indication that lightning is nearby. Seek a safe place to shelter, preferably indoors. Indoors safety measures:\nOnce you've found shelter indoors, abstain from using corded phones, electrical appliances, or plumbing fixtures, and refrain from approaching windows and doors. Lightning can follow conductive pathways, and these precautions reduce the risk of electrical surges. Wait for the all-clear:\nAfter the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities. It's important to remember that lightning can strike even when a storm seems to have passed, so exercise caution. When indoor shelter isn't available:\nIf you find yourself outdoors with no access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety:\nAvoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, as they expose you to greater lightning risk. Steer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In forested areas, stay close to lower stands of trees. If you're in a group, ensure that individuals are spaced out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people. Camping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If you have no alternative, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. It's crucial to note that a tent provides no protection against lightning. Do not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. Although water and metal do not attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks. In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, preparedness and vigilance are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of lightning-related incidents and prioritize your safety.\nMastering wet roads: Safety tips for heavy rainfall When heavy rain strikes, safety is paramount. Equip yourself with these guidelines from the weather service to navigate wet roads and avoid hazards:\nBeware of swollen waterways:\nIn heavy rain, refrain from parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a grave danger.\nMaintain safe driving distances:\nThe two-second rule for following distance is your ally in heavy rain. Extend it to four seconds to ensure safe spacing in adverse conditions.\nReduce speed and drive cautiously:\nOn wet roads, reducing your speed is crucial. Ease off the gas pedal gradually and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.\nChoose your lane wisely:\nStick to the middle lanes on multi-lane roads to minimize the risk of hydroplaning, as water tends to accumulate in outer lanes.\nPrioritize visibility\nEnhance your visibility in heavy rain by turning on your headlights. Watch out for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them.\nWatch out for slippery roads:\nThe initial half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mixture of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period.\nKeep a safe distance from large vehicles:\nDon't follow large trucks or buses too closely. The spray created by their large tires reduces your vision. Take care when passing them as well; if you must pass, do so quickly and safely.\nMind your windshield wipers:\nOverloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely limits your sight, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or protected spots.\nWhen stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.\nIn the face of heavy rain, these precautions can make a significant difference in ensuring your safety on the road. Remember to stay informed about weather conditions and heed guidance from local authorities for a secure journey.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

    "title": "گلیوبلاستوما یکی از چالش‌برانگیزترین سرطان‌هاست/ مشاهده این تومور در کودکان نادر است",
    "text": "گلیوبلاستوما یک نوع تومور مغزی بدخیم و تهاجمی است که از سلولهای گلیال (سلولهای پشتیبان مغز) منشا میگیرد. این تومور به سرعت رشد میکند و به بافتهای اطراف مغز نفوذ میکند، که همین امر تشخیص و درمان آن را چالشبرانگیز میکند.\nبه همین بهانه با دکتر مرتضی اشرافی فوق تخصص جراحی مغز واعصاب کودکان بیمارستان فوق تخصصی محک درباره این تومور مغزی، علایم، روش های درمان و ... گفت وگو کرده ایم که در ادامه می خوانید:\nگلیوبلاستوما چیست و چرا تا این حد نگرانکننده محسوب میشود؟\nمغز ما از سلولهای مختلفی تشکیل شده است. دستهای از این سلولها، سلولهای «گلیال» یا «پشتیبان» نام دارند که وظیفهشان حمایت و تغذیه سلولهای اصلی عصبی یا همان نورونهاست. گلیوبلاستوما (Glioblastoma) یا به اختصار GBM، نوعی تومور سرطانی است که از همین سلولهای پشتیبان نشأت میگیرد.\nدلیل نگرانی اصلی ما دو مورد است: اول، سرعت رشد بسیار بالای این تومور. دوم، ماهیت تهاجمی و نفوذی آن. برخلاف بسیاری از تومورها که یک توده مشخص و با مرزهای واضح دارند، گلیوبلاستوما مانند ریشههای یک گیاه در بافت سالم مغز نفوذ میکند. این ویژگی، حذف کامل تومور را از طریق جراحی فوقالعاده دشوار و تقریباً غیرممکن میسازد، چرا که ما نمیتوانیم بافت سالم مغز را بیش از حد دستکاری کنیم.\nچه علائمی ممکن است یک فرد را مشکوک به این بیماری کند؟ آیا علائم خاص و منحصر به فردی دارد؟\nمتأسفانه گلیوبلاستوما علائم اختصاصی ندارد و علائم آن بسته به محل قرارگیری تومور در مغز متفاوت است. اما برخی علائم عمومی و شایع وجود دارند که باید جدی گرفته شوند، خصوصاً اگر به صورت پیشرونده و جدید باشند. این علائم عبارتند از:\nسردردهای شدید و مداوم: که معمولاً صبحها بدتر است و با مسکنهای معمولی بهبود پیدا نمیکند.\nتشنج: شروع ناگهانی تشنج در فردی که سابقه آن را نداشته، یک زنگ خطر جدی است.\nتغییرات شخصیتی یا رفتاری: مثلاً بیتفاوتی، پرخاشگری ناگهانی یا اختلال در قضاوت.\nمشکلات شناختی: مانند اختلال در حافظه کوتاهمدت، مشکل در پیدا کردن کلمات یا عدم تمرکز.\nضعف یا بیحسی پیشرونده در یک سمت بدن (دست یا پا).\nاختلال در تکلم یا بینایی.\nنکته کلیدی این است که این علائم به مرور زمان بدتر میشوند. اگر فردی چنین علائمی را تجربه کرد، باید هرچه سریعتر به متخصص مغز و اعصاب مراجعه کند.\nفرآیند تشخیص چگونه انجام میشود؟\nقدم اول، یک معاینه دقیق عصبی است. ما رفلکسها، قدرت عضلانی، حس، بینایی و تعادل بیمار را بررسی میکنیم. اگر به وجود ضایعهای در مغز مشکوک شویم، قدم بعدی و قطعی، تصویربرداری است.\nابزار طلایی ما برای تشخیص، امآرآی (MRI) مغز با تزریق ماده حاجب است. در تصاویرMRI، گلیوبلاستوما معمولاً به شکل یک توده حلقوی با مرکز مرده (نکروز) دیده میشود که ماده حاجب را به شدت جذب میکند. این نما بسیار شاخص است.\nاما تشخیص نهایی و قطعی، همیشه با نمونهبرداری (بیوپسی) و بررسی آسیبشناسی (پاتولوژی) تایید میشود. یعنی تکهای از تومور، یا در حین جراحی برای برداشتن توده و یا به صورت مجزا، برداشته شده و زیر میکروسکوپ بررسی میشود تا نوع دقیق و درجه بدخیمی سلولها مشخص شود.\nوقتی تشخیص قطعی شد، چه راهکارهایی برای بیمار وجود دارد؟\nدرمان گلیوبلاستوما یک کار تیمی و چند رشتهای است و صرفاً به جراحی محدود نمیشود. پروتکل استاندارد شامل سه بخش اصلی است:\n1. جراحی (Surgical Resection): هدف اول ما، برداشتن حداکثر میزان ممکن از تومور است، البته تا جایی که به عملکردهای حیاتی مغز بیمار (مثل تکلم یا حرکت) آسیبی وارد نشود. هرچه تومور بیشتری برداشته شود، فشار از روی مغز کمتر شده، علائم بیمار بهبود مییابد و اثربخشی درمانهای بعدی بیشتر میشود..\n2. رادیوتراپی (پرتودرمانی): پس از جراحی و بهبود بیمار، مرحله پرتودرمانی به همراه شیمیدرمانی خوراکی آغاز میشود. به مدت حدود شش هفته، به بستر تومور و حاشیه آن اشعه تابانده میشود تا سلولهای سرطانی باقیمانده از بین بروند.\n3. شیمیدرمانی (Chemotherapy): همزمان با رادیوتراپی، بیمار یک داروی شیمیدرمانی خوراکی به نام تموزولوماید (Temozolomide) را دریافت میکند. پس از اتمام دوره پرتودرمانی، این دارو برای چندین دوره دیگر به تنهایی ادامه مییابد.\nپیشآگهی این بیماری چگونه است و چه چشماندازی برای آینده وجود دارد؟\nباید صادقانه بگویم که گلیوبلاستوما همچنان یکی از چالشبرانگیزترین سرطانهاست و متاسفانه علیرغم تمام این درمانهای ترکیبی، بیماری در اکثر موارد پس از مدتی عود میکند. اما این به معنای ناامیدی نیست. اولاً، هدف ما از درمان، افزایش طول عمر بیمار همراه با حفظ کیفیت زندگی است. ما برای هر روز و هر ماه زندگی باکیفیت بیمار میجنگیم.\nثانیاً، علم به سرعت در حال پیشرفت است. تحقیقات گستردهای در زمینه ژنتیک تومور، درمانهای هدفمند (Targeted Therapy) و فعالسازی سیستم ایمنی بدن برای حمله به سلولهای سرطانی در جریان است. هر سال که میگذرد، ما درک بهتری از این بیماری پیدا میکنیم و گامهای کوچکی به جلو برمیداریم.\nیک سوال که شاید ذهن بسیاری از خانوادهها را درگیر کند این است که آیا این بیماری در کودکان هم دیده میشود؟ آیا در بچهها هم گلیوبلاستوما داریم؟\nبله، اما با ملاحظات بسیار مهمی. گلیوبلاستوما میتواند در کودکان هم رخ دهد، اما خوشبختانه بسیار نادر است. به طور کلی، تومورهای مغزی در کودکان نسبت به بزرگسالان الگوهای متفاوتی دارند.\nآگلیوبلاستومای واقعی اطفال، زیرمجموعهای از HGG اطفال است. اما امروزه بسیاری از تومورهایی که قبلاً این نام را میگرفتند، بر اساس پروفایل ژنتیکیشان، نامهای دقیقتری پیدا کردهاند.\nهنوز میتوانیم از این لغت برای تومورهایی در کودکان استفاده کنیم که معیارهای تشخیصی مولکولی و بافتی گلیوبلاستوما را طبق تعریف (WHO) داشته باشند و جهشهای اختصاصی دیگری در آنها یافت نشود. اما پزشکان و پاتولوژیستهای مدرن، تمایل دارند از اصطلاح جامعتر و دقیقتر گلیومای درجه بالای اطفال (Pediatric High-Grade Glioma) استفاده کنند و سپس نوع مولکولی آن را مشخص کنند. این کار به انتخاب درمان هدفمند و پیشبینی آینده بیماری کمک شایانی میکند.\nدر واقع، این تغییر نام، صرفاً یک بازی با کلمات نیست؛ بلکه نشاندهنده درک عمیقتر ما از بیولوژی این تومورها و حرکت به سوی پزشکی دقیق و شخصیسازی شده (Precision Medicine) برای این کودکان است.",

    "text": "WCIA — Illinois basketball player Terrence Shannon Jr. is suspended from all team activities after the senior All-American candidate was charged with rape in Kansas. The alleged incident occurred back in September when Shannon Jr. was visiting Lawrence for the Illinois football game. A warrant for his arrest was issued on Wednesday by the Douglas County District Attorney. Shannon Jr. turned himself into authorities Thursday, where he posted bail and returned to Champaign, per a release from the school. “The University and DIA have shown time and again that we have zero tolerance for sexual misconduct,” Illinois athletic director Josh Whitman said in a statement. “At the same time, DIA policy affords student-athletes appropriate levels of due process based on the nature and severity of the allegations. We will rely on that policy and our prior experiences to manage this situation appropriately for the University and the involved parties.” According to the school, Shannon Jr. was not in Lawrence on official University business, nor was he a member of the University’s travel party for football. DIA and Urbana campus officials have been aware of a Lawrence police investigation into Shannon since late September but, until Wednesday, had yet to receive actionable information. Shannon’s arrest triggers the DIA student-athlete misconduct policy . Under that policy, Shannon has been immediately suspended from all team activities. Any change to Shannon’s status will be communicated in a timely manner. Illinois athletic director Josh Whitman will be available to the media on Friday evening before Illinois faces Fairleigh Dickinson at 8 p.m. at State Farm Center.

    "text": "A paramilitary group at war with Sudan’s military endorses a cease-fire during holy fasting month A Sudanese paramilitary group battling the country’s military in a nearly yearlong ruinous conflict endorsed Saturday a [resolution by the U.N. Security Council](https://apnews.com/article/un-ramadan-ceasefire-sudan-e70b7bc1b0b71ebd51dc4a4fbb5090ca) calling for a cease-fire during the [Muslim holy month of Ramadan](https://apnews.com/article/ramadan-islam-fasting-islamic-holy-month-d8c9e002e4904c5d8e0ccee2b77f9ad4). The group, known as the Rapid Support Forces, said in a statement that it hopes the resolution, adopted by the U.N. Security Council on Friday, would help deliver crucially needed humanitarian assistance to millions of Sudanese trapped in the fighting across the Northeastern African country. [Ramadan, during which adult Muslims are required to fast from dawn to sunset](https://apnews.com/hub/ramadan), is expected to start on or around Monday, depending on the sighting of the crescent moon. The RSF said it views the initiative as a “crucial opportunity” for the warring parties to embark on negotiations to find a political settlement to the conflict. “We view this as a crucial opportunity to initiate earnest discussions that could catalyze a political pathway. This pathway must culminate in a durable ceasefire, foster security and stability, and result in a substantive resolution that addresses the foundational issues of the historical crisis in Sudan,” it said. Sudan’s military has already supported a call by [U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres](https://apnews.com/hub/antonio-guterres) for a Ramadan cease-fire. In his Thursday appeal, Guterres warned Thursday that the conflict threatens Sudan’s unity and “could ignite regional instability of dramatic proportions.” Sudan plunged into chaos in April last year, when long-simmering tensions between its military, led by [Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan,](https://apnews.com/article/sudan-war-military-rsf-burhan-dagalo-igad-4bc7a44bfb808d3b85be9d6921e4f856) and the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary commanded by [Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo](https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-sudan-ramaphosa-dagalo-f27d6d524a828b5a95ed1caa6447c7c3) broke into street battles in the capital, Khartoum. The fighting broke out during Ramadan last year. Fighting spread to other parts of the country, especially urban areas, but in Sudan’s western [Darfur region](https://apnews.com/article/sudan-darfur-fighting-war-crimes-705bdb1ac90fc7b2903f68e6f666c3ca) it took on a different form, with brutal attacks by the Arab-dominated Rapid Support Forces on [ethnic African civilians](https://apnews.com/article/sudan-fighting-generals-darfur-civilians-truce-9ecdcff2a388e423f7c88bb2e96ff8cc). Thousands of people have been killed. The 15-member Security Council voted overwhelmingly in favor of the British-drafted cease-fire resolution, with 14 countries in support and only Russia abstaining. The resolution expressed “grave concern over the spreading violence and the catastrophic and deteriorating humanitarian situation, including crisis levels, or worse, of acute food insecurity, particularly in Darfur.” The head of the World Food Program, Cindy McCain, said earlier this week that the conflict [risks creating the world’s largest hunger crisis,](https://apnews.com/article/sudan-war-hunger-wfp-adfd7107d49732e1aee7cf8d5a9b0065) with some 18 million people across Sudan facing acute hunger, including 5 million who face starvation. The conflict has uprooted more than 10 million people either to safer areas inside Sudan or to neighboring countries, according to U.N. agencies. South Sudan received 600,000 people who fled the fighting in Sudan.

    "text": "PHOTOS - Aurores boréales dans le Gard et en Sud-Ardèche Gard, Ardèche : il fallait lever les yeux, et loin des lumières artificielles, pour en profiter ce jeudi soir. Des aurores boréales ont ravi les yeux des plus patients d'entre nous. Elles font toujours rêver, et offrent des clichés magnifiques : les aurores boréales. Le ciel, ce jeudi soir, a peut-être pu vous en offrir, si vous avez été patients, et d'autant plus si vous étiez loin des lumières artificielles. C'était le cas par exemple de Frédéric Gilles dans le Gard, et d'Anne-Laure Lopez, qui ont accepté de confier quelques-uns de leurs clichés à France Bleu. Frédéric Gilles est originaire du quartier du Rieu, à Alès (Gard). Il a fait partie du club d'astronomie d'Alès, jusqu'à il y a peu encore. Le temps lui manque pour participer activement. Mais il ne manque pas des occasions comme celle-ci. Il a pris ses photos vers 20h30, le phénomène était visible pendant une dizaine de minutes. Anne-Laure se trouve pour sa part à Saint-Etienne-de-Fontbellon, près d'Aubenas (Ardèche). Son conseil pour réussir les photos : \"mettez vous en pause longue, 6 secondes minimum\". Elle va faire des chanceux : \"Elle est visible à l'œil nu, une fois que vous avez habitué vos yeux, garantit-elle. Et nous avons la chance d'avoir un ciel dégagé ce soir\". Le phénomène pourrait à nouveau se présenter ce vendredi soir. Comment être mieux soigné en France ? Consultation citoyenne France Bleu X [Make.org](https://make.org/FR). Déserts médicaux, qualité des soins, formation et salaires des soignants, accompagnement des malades, pénuries de médicaments… ces sujets qui concernent la santé en France sont au cœur de l’actualité et de l’attention d’une immense majorité de citoyens.

    "title": "Iranians mourn Guards’ commander killed in Israeli strike",
    "text": "TEHRAN: Thousands massed Thursday in the Iranian capital for the funeral of senior Revolutionary Guards commander Razi Moussavi, three days after he was killed in what Tehran says was an Israeli strike. The crowd in Tehran’s central Imam Hossein square chanted “Death to Israel” and “Death to America”. Many waved yellow flags imprinted with the message “I am your opponent” — a reference to Israel — in both Persian and Hebrew. Israel has long fought a shadow war of assassinations and sabotage against arch foe Iran and its allies, but Moussavi’s killing in Syria came at a time of sharply heightened regional tensions over the Israel-Hamas conflict since early October. Some of the mourners in Tehran carried pictures of Moussavi together with the revered Qasem Soleimani, a former commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’s foreign operations arm who was killed in a 2020 US drone strike in Baghdad. Iran next week will mark the fourth anniversary of the death of Soleimani, who had run the IRGC’s Quds Force for more than a decade. Iranian state media says an Israeli missile strike on Monday near the Syrian capital Damascus killed Moussavi, a Quds Force general and the most senior Guards commander killed since Soleimani. The Israeli army, which has launched hundreds of strikes on Iran-linked targets in war-torn Syria in recent years, said only that it does not comment on foreign media reports.
