    "title": "New York Authorities Warn Residents to Expect Cellular Disruptions During Upcoming Solar Eclipse, Suggest Residents to Stock Up on Food, Water, and Fuel | The Gateway Pundit | by Anthony Scott",
    "text": "In response to NASA’s report that a total solar eclipse will occur on April 8, 2024, New York authorities are warning New Yorkers to be prepared. In a recent press release by the New York state police, officials warned residents to be prepared for cellular disruptions, slow 9/11 response times, gridlocked traffic, and food/water demand during the upcoming total solar eclipse. Also included in the press release was a list of suggestions calling for residents to stock up on food, water, and fuel. The warning by New York state police comes as the department looks to learn from their responses to the 2017 solar eclipse. — NewsChannel 9 (@NewsChannel9) March 21, 2024 Per New York State Police : The New York State Police, in close collaboration with other state, local, and federal law enforcement, emergency services, and transportation agencies, has meticulously developed an emergency operation plan. Our unwavering goal is to provide a comprehensive and uniform presence, ensuring the safety of both visitors and residents as they experience and travel home from the eclipse. Members of the State Police will implement security measures appropriate for large gatherings and take all necessary actions to maintain order and smooth traffic flow. Building on past experiences, the planning process for this event has been proactive, aiming to address potential impacts within Troop E. Our goal is to minimize any adverse effects associated with the large influx of visitors to the local area. This approach is based on the lessons learned from the 2017 solar eclipse, where some regions experienced a 100 percent increase in their population in the days leading up to and during the eclipse. Troop E Headquarters will operate as the command post for all State Police operations, with forward operating bases established at SP Zone Headquarters located in Rochester, Auburn, and Bath. Emergency Operations Centers (EOC) will also be located in every county, with State Police representatives there. The State Police plan to increase the number of available personnel during the event. Strike Teams will be strategically deployed to monitor traffic and respond rapidly to any issues that may interfere with the safe flow of traffic or affect the quick clearance of any incidents. The State Police will have additional aviation assets on hand to monitor traffic and perform rescue operations if needed. We will also have Marine, ATV/UTV, Commercial Vehicle Enforcement, Motorcycles, and UAS assets strategically located if needed. Here are the warnings and suggestions the New York State Police have listed: New York is one of many states preparing for the solar eclipse. The Gateway Pundit previously reported the Elyria Township Fire Department in Ohio warned residents to stay indoors during the solar eclipse. The statement released by the officials highlighted the importance of being well-prepared weeks in advance of the eclipse. It recommended that residents stock up on food, ensure they have a sufficient supply of their prescriptions picked up the week before, keep cell phone batteries charged, and schedule any necessary appointments for before or after the eclipse weekend.

Wildfires The actress' nephew, New Mexico writer Abe Streep, wrote about the fire's damage in a story for New York Magazine . He shared that his aunt had to cut a hole in her fence big enough for a car after she was told to evacuate earlier this month.\n\"My aunt Meryl Streep received an order to evacuate on January 8, but when she tried to leave, she discovered that a large tree had fallen over in her driveway, blocking her only exit,\" he wrote. \"Determined to make it out, she borrowed wire cutters from a neighbor, cut a car-size hole in the fence she shared with the neighbors on the other side, and drove through their yard to escape.\"\nAbe also wrote about how Martin Short, who is rumored to be dating Streep and stars with her in Only Murders in the Building , had to evacuate.\nThe Emmy-winning actor told Abe that it took him over an hour to leave his neighborhood in the Pacific Palisades. He saw some people leave their cars behind and walk away from the fire because the roads were jammed with everyone trying to escape at once.\nShort's house was not damaged by the fire, but one of his sons lost his home nearby.\nSince the wildfires started on January 7, thousands of people in L.A. have lost their homes, and many other buildings have burned down. As of Monday, at least 29 people had died in the fires.",

    "text": "All financial figures are in Canadian dollars ($ or C$) and all references to barrels are per barrel of bitumen unless otherwise noted. The Corporation's Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures are detailed in the Advisory section of this news release. They include: cash operating netback, bitumen realization net of transportation and storage expense, operating expenses net of power revenue, energy operating costs net of power revenue, non-energy operating costs, energy operating costs, adjusted funds flow, free cash flow and net debt.\nCALGARY, AB , Feb. 29, 2024 /CNW/ - MEG Energy Corp. (TSX:MEG) (\"MEG\" or the \"Corporation\") reported its full year 2023 operational and financial results.\n\"I am extremely proud of MEG's safety, operating, and financial performance in 2023\", said Derek Evans\n, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Annual production grew by 6%, averaging over 100,000 barrels per day for the first time and exiting the year at approximately 110,000 barrels per day. MEG's financial performance was also strong generating nearly $1 billion of free cash flow for debt repayment and share buybacks. At current prices MEG is well positioned to achieve US$600 million net debt in the third quarter of 2024, after which 100% of free cash flow will be returned to shareholders.\" Highlights include:\nAnnual free cash flow (\"FCF\") of $953 million used to repay $437 million of debt and return $446 million of capital to shareholders through the repurchase and cancellation of 19.0 million shares at a weighted average price of $23.54 per share. FCF of $254 million in the fourth quarter was used to repay $173 million of debt and repurchase 8.7 million shares at a weighted average price of $25.29 per share, returning $219 million to shareholders; The Corporation exited 2023 with net debt of US$730 million ( $1.0 billion ); Annual bitumen production of 101,425 barrels per day (\"bbls/d\") at a 2.27 steam-oil ratio (\"SOR\"), representing a 6% increase in production and a 4% decrease in SOR from 2022. Fourth quarter bitumen production averaged 109,112 bbls/d at a 2.28 SOR; Annual funds flow from operating activities (\"FFO\") and adjusted funds flow (\"AFF\") of $1,476 million and $1,402 million , or $5.13 and $4.87 per share, respectively. FFO and AFF totaled $358 million , or $1.27 per share, during the fourth quarter; Annual capital expenditures of $449 million and fourth quarter capital expenditures of $104 million were focused on sustaining and maintenance activities; Operating expenses net of power revenue declined 25% in 2023 to $5.96 per barrel, including $5.01 per barrel of non-energy operating costs and $0.95 per barrel of energy operating costs net of power revenue. Fourth quarter 2023 operating expenses net of power revenue rose 5% from the comparable 2022 quarter to $6.10 per barrel, including $4.64 per barrel of non-energy operating costs and $1.46 per barrel of energy operating costs net of power revenue; and Intended renewal of the Corporation's normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") for a one-year period upon its expiration on March 9, 2024 , which will allow the repurchase of an additional 10% of MEG's public float 1 .\n1 As defined by the Toronto Stock Exchange\nThree months ended December 31\nYear ended December 31\n($millions, except as indicated)\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nOperational results:\nBitumen production - bbls/d\n109,112\n110,805\n101,425\n95,338\nSteam-oil ratio\n2.28\n2.22\n2.27\n2.36\nBitumen sales - bbls/d\n112,634\n113,582\n101,086\n95,691\nBenchmark pricing:\nWTI - US$/bbl\n78.32\n82.65\n77.62\n94.23\nDifferential - WTI:AWB - Edmonton - US$/bbl\n(23.79)\n(29.14)\n(20.79)\n(20.64)\nAWB - Edmonton - US$/bbl\n54.53\n53.51\n56.83\n73.59\nDifferential - WTI:AWB - USGC - US$/bbl\n(7.43)\n(16.35)\n(8.72)\n(9.62)\nAWB - USGC - US$/bbl\n70.89\n66.30\n68.90\n84.61\nFinancial results:\nBitumen realization after net transportation\nand storage expense (1) - $/bbl\n63.52\n54.75\n62.46\n76.66\nNon-energy operating costs (2) - $/bbl\n4.64\n4.34\n5.01\n4.73\nEnergy operating costs net of power\nrevenue (1) - $/bbl\n1.46\n1.49\n0.95\n3.18\nOperating expenses net of power revenue -\n$/bbl\n6.10\n5.83\n5.96\n7.91\nCash operating netback (1) - $/bbl\n38.65\n43.89\n43.36\n62.61\nGeneral & administrative expense -\n$/bbl of bitumen production\n1.89\n1.62\n1.86\n1.78\nFunds flow from operating activities\n358\n383\n1,476\n1,882\nPer share, diluted\n1.27\n1.28\n5.13\n6.09\nAdjusted funds flow (3)\n358\n401\n1,402\n1,934\nPer share, diluted (3)\n1.27\n1.34\n4.87\n6.26\nCapital expenditures\n104\n106\n449\n376\nFree cash flow (3)\n254\n295\n953\n1,558\nDebt repayments - US$\n128\n150\n322\n1,016\nShare repurchases - C$\n219\n196\n446\n382\nRevenues\n1,444\n1,445\n5,653\n6,118\nNet earnings\n103\n159\n569\n902\nPer share, diluted\n0.37\n0.53\n1.98\n2.92\nLong-term debt, including current portion\n1,124\n1,581\n1,124\n1,581\nNet debt - US$ (3)\n730\n1,026\n730\n1,026\n(1)\nNon-GAAP financial measure - please refer to the Advisory section of this news release.\n(2)\nSupplementary financial measure - please refer to the Advisory section of this news release.\n(3)\nCapital management measure - please refer to the Advisory section of this news release.\nFourth Quarter Results\nFCF of $254 million was used to repay US$128 million ( $173 million ) of debt and repurchase 8.7 million shares, returning $219 million to shareholders.\nAverage bitumen production of 109,112 bbls/d was similar to 110,805 bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2022 reflecting stable operations and no significant maintenance activity in both periods.\nAFF decreased to $358 million , or $1.27 per share, from $401 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting a 12% decline in the cash operating netback.\nThe lower cash operating netback reflects increased royalty expense, the result of reaching payout status in the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by a higher bitumen realization due to narrower WTI:AWB differentials and lower diluent expense.\nAnnual Financial Results\nAFF decreased to $1,402 million , or $4.87 per share, in 2023 from $1,934 million , or $6.26 per share, in 2022 driven by a lower cash operating netback partially offset by lower interest expense. The 31% decline in the cash operating netback for 2023 reflects a lower bitumen realization after net transportation and storage expense and higher royalties, the result of reaching payout status.\nBitumen realization after net transportation and storage expense decreased to $62.46 per barrel in 2023, from $76.66 per barrel in 2022, primarily driven by a lower average WTI benchmark price partially offset by the realized price improvement from MEG's strategic market access and marketing optimization activities.\nThe Corporation sold 66% of blend sales volumes in the U.S. Gulf Coast during both 2023 and 2022 and average heavy oil apportionment on the Enbridge mainline system was 9% and 5%, respectively, in those years.\nFCF totaled $953 million in 2023, compared to $1,558 million in 2022, reflecting lower AFF and higher capital spending.\nAnnual capital expenditures of $449 million were in line with guidance and rose from $376 million in 2022 due to increased scope, inflation and timing of field development and maintenance work. Spending in both years focused on sustaining and maintenance activities.\nNet earnings declined to $569 million in 2023 from $902 million in 2022 primarily driven by a lower cash operating netback, higher depletion and depreciation expense and an onerous contract expense. These were partially offset by an unrealized foreign exchange gain on long-term debt and reduced interest and income tax expenses.\nAnnual Operating Results\nAnnual bitumen production in 2023 rose 6% to 101,425 bbls/d at a 2.27 SOR from 95,338 bbls/d at a 2.36 SOR in 2022. The production increase and improved SOR reflects a continued focus on short-cycle redevelopment programs, enhanced completion designs, optimized well spacing and targeted facility enhancements. Production was impacted by major planned turnaround activities at the Christina Lake Facility in both years.\nNon‐energy operating costs averaged $5.01 per barrel of bitumen sales in 2023, in line with guidance and representing a 6% increase from 2022 despite inflationary pressures on the cost of services, treating chemicals and staff.\nEnergy operating costs net of power revenue decreased to $0.95 per barrel in 2023 from $3.18 per barrel in 2022 as weaker natural gas prices more than offset reduced power revenue. Revenue from the sale of excess power generated by the Corporation's cogeneration facilities offset 76% and 56% of energy operating costs in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAnnual Debt Repayment and Share Repurchases\nThe $953 million of 2023 FCF was used to repay debt, return capital to shareholders and fund working capital requirements. The Corporation repaid US$322 million (approximately $437 million ) of outstanding 7.125% senior unsecured notes at a weighted average price of 101.7% and returned $446 million to shareholders through the repurchase and cancellation of 19.0 million shares at a weighted average price of $23.54 per share, approximately 7% of MEG's December 31, 2022 issued and outstanding shares.\nCapital Allocation Strategy\nApproximately 50% of FCF was allocated to debt repayment in 2023 with the remainder applied to share repurchases. 100% of FCF will be returned to shareholders when the Corporation reaches its US$600 million net debt target, which is anticipated to occur in the third quarter of 2024 assuming a US$75 per barrel WTI price. The Corporation exited 2023 with net debt of US$730 million (approximately $1.0 billion ).\nThe Corporation intends to renew the current NCIB for a one-year period upon its expiration on March 9, 2024 , which will allow the repurchase of an additional 10% of MEG's public float.\nSustainability and Pathways Update\nThe Corporation published its third ESG report in September 2023 , which discusses its foundational commitments of Business Model Resilience and Governance and the Corporation's priority ESG topics: Health and Safety; Climate Change and GHG Emissions; Water Management; Energy Security; Energy Affordability; and Indigenous Relations. The ESG report illustrates progress in several areas, including the establishment of a new mid-term absolute GHG emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) reduction target of 0.63 megatonnes per year by year-end 2030 (which represents approximately 30% of the Corporation's 2019 GHG emissions); $72 million spent on goods and services provided by Indigenous businesses in 2022 (a 30% increase over 2021); the launch of the Corporation's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion education and awareness campaign focused on ensuring that every team member is valued, respected and heard to enhance decision making, innovation, employee engagement and the Corporation's long-term success; and the continued advancement of the Corporation's safety management programs and systems to ensure safe, sustainable and reliable operations.\nMEG, along with its Pathways Alliance peers, continues to progress pre-work on the proposed foundational carbon capture and storage (\"CCS\") project, which will transport CO 2 via pipeline from multiple oil sands facilities to be stored safely and permanently underground in the Cold Lake region of Alberta . The Pathways Alliance continues to advance detailed evaluations of the proposed carbon storage hub and is working to obtain a carbon sequestration agreement from the Alberta Government in the first half of 2024 to support regulatory submissions. In addition, the Pathways Alliance continues to advance engineering work, environmental field programs to minimize the project's environmental disturbance, and consultations with Indigenous and local communities along the proposed CO 2 transportation and storage network corridor. The Pathways Alliance continues to work collaboratively with both the federal and Alberta Governments on the necessary policy and co-financing frameworks required to move the project forward. The federal government has proposed an investment tax credit (\"ITC\") for CCS projects for all sectors across Canada and introduced implementing legislation for the CCS ITC in November 2023 . In addition, the Alberta Government announced an Alberta Carbon Capture Incentive Program (\"ACCIP\") which aims to help hard-to-abate industries by providing a grant of 12% for new eligible CCS capital costs. The Pathways Alliance is evaluating these proposals and will continue to work with the federal and Alberta Governments to secure the required financial support and regulatory certainty to enable the CCS project to proceed.\nAdditional information regarding the Corporation's ESG actions, including the Corporation's 2023 ESG Report, is available in the \"Sustainability\" section of the Corporation's website at www.megenergy.com. The Corporation's ESG Report and contents of MEG's website are expressly not incorporated by reference in this news release.\n2024 Guidance\nSummary of 2024 Guidance\nBitumen production - annual average\n102,000 to 108,000 bbls/d\nCapital expenditures\n$550 million\nNon-energy operating costs\n$5.10 to $5.40 per bbl\nG&A expense\n$1.75 to $1.95 per bbl\nThe 2024 annual production estimate incorporates reduced turnaround activities spread evenly throughout the year. The plan also includes the startup of two well pads, with the first pad on-stream mid-year and the second in the fourth quarter. New pad activity supports the 2024 production estimate and builds well capacity for future growth.\nThe Corporation's 2024 capital expenditure program will allocate $450 million to sustaining activities and $100 million towards multi-year productive capacity growth. The growth investment reflects the commencement of a three-year project with an estimated total cost of approximately $300 million forecasted to deliver incremental productive capacity around the end of 2026.\nThe Corporation's balance sheet and operating performance provide a solid foundation to fund the 2024 capital expenditure program. As a result, no WTI or WTI:WCS differential risk management contracts have been entered into for 2024.\nAdjusted Funds Flow Sensitivity\nMEG's production is comprised entirely of crude oil and AFF is highly correlated with crude oil benchmark prices and light-heavy oil differentials. The following table provides an annual sensitivity estimate to the most significant market variables.\nVariable\nRange\n2024 AFF Sensitivity (1)(2) - C$mm\nWCS Differential (US$/bbl)\n+/- US$1.00 /bbl\n+/- C$47mm\nWTI (US$/bbl)\n+/- US$1.00 /bbl\n+/- C$31mm\nBitumen Production (bbls/d)\n+/- 1,000 bbls/d\n+/- C$16mm\nCondensate (US$/bbl)\n+/- US$1.00 /bbl\n+/- C$14mm\nExchange Rate (C$/US$)\n+/- $0.01\n+/- C$10mm\nNon-Energy Opex (C$/bbl)\n+/- C$0.25 /bbl\n+/- C$6mm\nAECO Gas (3) (C$/GJ)\n+/- C$0.50 /GJ\n+/- C$6mm\n(1)\nEach sensitivity is independent of changes to other variables.\n(2)\nAssumes mid point of 2024 production guidance, US$75.00 /bbl WTI, US$16.25 /bbl WTI:WCS Edmonton discount, US$1.50 /bbl WCS:AWB Edmonton discount, US$7.75 /bbl WTI: AWB Gulf Coast discount, C$1.35 /US$ F/X rate, condensate purchased at 100% of WTI and one bbl of bitumen per 1.42 bbls of blend sales (1.42 blend ratio).\n(3)\nAssumes 1.4 GJ/bbl of bitumen, 65% of 160 MW of power generation sold externally and a 25.0 GJ/MWh heat rate.\nConference Call\nA conference call will be held to review MEG's 2023 annual operating and financial results at 6:30 a.m. Mountain Time ( 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time ) on March 1, 2024 . To participate, please dial the North American toll-free number 1-888-390-0546, or the international call number 1-416-764-8688.\nA recording of the call will be available by 12 p.m. Mountain Time ( 2 p.m. Eastern Time ) on the same day at https://www.megenergy.com/investors/presentations-events/ .\nADVISORY\nBasis of Presentation\nMEG prepares its financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IFRS Accounting Standards\") and presents financial results in Canadian dollars ($ or C$), which is the Corporation's functional currency.\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Measures\nCertain financial measures in this news release are non-GAAP financial measures or ratios, supplementary financial measures and capital management measures. These measures are not defined by IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies. These non-GAAP and other financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nAdjusted Funds Flow and Free Cash Flow\nAdjusted funds flow and free cash flow are capital management measures and are defined in the Corporation's consolidated financial statements. Adjusted funds flow and free cash flow are presented to assist management and investors in analyzing operating performance and cash flow generating ability. Funds flow from operating activities is an IFRS measure in the Corporation's consolidated statement of cash flow. Adjusted funds flow is calculated as funds flow from operating activities excluding items not considered part of ordinary continuing operating results. By excluding non-recurring adjustments, the adjusted funds flow measure provides a meaningful metric for management and investors by establishing a clear link between the Corporation's cash flows and cash operating netback. Free cash flow is presented to assist management and investors in analyzing performance by the Corporation as a measure of financial liquidity and the capacity of the business to repay debt and return capital to shareholders. Free cash flow is calculated as adjusted funds flow less capital expenditures.\nIn the second quarter of 2022, an adjustment was made to the presentation of adjusted funds flow and free cash flow. In April 2020 , the Corporation issued cash-settled RSUs under its long-term incentive (\"LTI\") plan when the share price was at a historic low of $1.57 per share. Concurrent with the issuance, the Corporation entered equity price risk management contracts to manage share price volatility in the subsequent three-year period, effectively reducing share price appreciation cash flow risk. The increase in the Corporation's share price from April 2020 to June 30, 2022 resulted in the recognition of a significant cash-settled stock-based compensation expense, which was previously included as a component of adjusted funds flow and free cash flow. The actual cash impact of the 2020 cash-settled RSUs, however, was subject to equity price risk management contracts, so the cash impact over the term of these RSUs was reduced and the change in value did not provide a valuable indication of operating performance.\nTherefore, the financial statement impacts of the April 2020 cash-settled stock-based compensation and the equity price risk management contracts were excluded from adjusted funds flow and free cash flow. All prior periods presented have been adjusted to reflect this change in presentation.\nThe following table reconciles FFO to AFF to FCF:\nThree months ended December 31\nYear ended December 31\n($millions)\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nFunds flow from operating activities\n$ 358\n$ 383\n$ 1,476\n$ 1,882\nAdjustments:\nImpact of cash-settled SBC units subject to equity price risk management\n—\n18\n13\n98\nRealized equity price risk management gain\n—\n—\n(87)\n(46)\nAdjusted funds flow\n358\n401\n1,402\n1,934\nCapital expenditures\n(104)\n(106)\n(449)\n(376)\nFree cash flow\n$ 254\n$ 295\n$ 953\n$ 1,558\nNet Debt\nNet debt is a capital management measure and is defined in the Corporation's consolidated financial statements. Net debt is an important measure used by management to analyze leverage and liquidity. Net debt is calculated as long-term debt plus current portion of long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents.\nThe following table reconciles the Corporation's current and long-term debt to net debt:\nAs at\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nLong-term debt\n$ 1,124\n$ 1,578\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n—\n3\nCash and cash equivalents\n(160)\n(192)\nNet debt - C$\n$ 964\n$ 1,389\nNet debt - US$\n$ 730\n$ 1,026\nCash Operating Netback\nCash operating netback is a non-GAAP financial measure, or ratio when expressed on a per barrel basis. Its terms are not defined by IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nCash operating netback is a financial measure widely used in the oil and gas industry as a supplemental measure of a company's efficiency and its ability to generate cash flow for debt repayment, capital expenditures, or other uses. The per barrel calculation of cash operating netback is based on bitumen sales volumes.\nRevenues is an IFRS measure in the Corporation's consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income which is the most directly comparable primary financial statement measure to cash operating netback. A reconciliation from revenues to cash operating netback has been provided below:\nThree months ended December 31\nYear ended December 31\n($millions)\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nRevenues\n$ 1,444\n$ 1,445\n$ 5,653\n$ 6,118\nDiluent expense\n(471)\n(505)\n(1,691)\n(1,848)\nTransportation and storage expense\n(148)\n(151)\n(600)\n(538)\nPurchased product\n(334)\n(216)\n(1,400)\n(1,135)\nOperating expenses\n(82)\n(115)\n(334)\n(420)\nRealized gain (loss) on commodity risk management\n(9)\n1\n(28)\n10\nCash operating netback\n$ 400\n$ 459\n$ 1,600\n$ 2,187\nBlend Sales and Bitumen Realization\nBlend sales and bitumen realization are non-GAAP financial measures, or ratios when expressed on a per barrel basis, and are used as a measure of the Corporation's marketing strategy by isolating petroleum revenue and costs associated with its produced and purchased products and excludes royalties. Their terms are not defined by IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Blend sales per barrel is based on blend sales volumes and bitumen realization per barrel is based on bitumen sales volumes.\nRevenues is an IFRS measure in the Corporation's consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income, which is the most directly comparable primary financial statement measure to blend sales and bitumen realization.

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#27](c27#c-27) El \"mundo civilizado\" en el cual también está Españita mantuvo a uno de sus ciudadanos preso durante dos años sin ni siquiera una acusación.\nSe habla de jardín cuando en realidad es un vertedero.\n[#28](c28#c-28) vas a comparar a España con Rusia por el amor De Dios, ve a Rusia si eres homosexual que sales cantando lírica cristiana si no te han decapitado antes. Pero que atrevida es la ingenuidad de comparar a los países con las democracias más desarrolladas con auténticos estercoleros fascistas donde si eres gay simplemente eres un terrorista. Y ya ni te hablo de la libertad de prensa. Pero en serio alguien en su sano juicio puede creer que vivimos igual en España que en Rusia! Claro que hay cosas por mejorar en España pero es la noche y el día.\n[#35](c35#c-35) Mira, Rusia es una puta mierda, pero estamos financiando y armando a otros mierdosos que son iguales o peores y mientras nuestra supuesta superioridad hace aguas, por apoyar a nazis eslavos a que hagan la guerra a otros porque a nuestro amo, que son otros hijos de la gran puta, unos retrasados y paletos con bases en nuestra casa, lo ha decidido así pq pensaba que debíamos comprarle a él en lugar de a otro.\nPor lo demás en España hasta antes de ayer se ha encerrado y torturado a inocentes y sigue siendo una pseudodemocracia donde el jefe de estado, el emérito y el cornudo de su hijo, fueron puestos por el dictador que admiran muchos de los que no dudarían en fusilar al resto.\nEspaña fue y sigue siendo un estercolero y mientras haya quien no lo vea así lo seguirá siendo.\n[#40](c40#c-40) a quien estamos financiado que sean peores? Claro que España tiene cosas a mejorar pero tú consideras que nuestra libertad es equiparable a países como Rusia? En todos los países del planeta se han torturado personas y eso es terrible pero se tiene que mirar desde un punto de vista constructivo para mejorar las cosas. No creer que somos la misma mierda que es Rusia, Israel, EEUU o Corea del Norte. Ya que España no está cometiendo ningún genocidio en la actualidad ni persigue a ningún colectivo. Ni censura a nadie. Prueba es que tú y yo hablemos de lo que nos salga. Que ya está bien de tanta equidistancia joder, que no somos lo mismo. Que a Rusia y a Israel y a todos los que han financiado esa barbarie se las debe sentar ante una corte penal por crímenes de lesa humanidad. Que son auténticos estercoleros que debemos erradicar de la faz de la tierra.\n[#44](c44#c-44) Yo ya sé cuál es tu criterio de libertad cuando un ciudadano ha sido encerrado sin acusación durante dos años y tú lo has sentenciado.\nTú eres Rusia, tú eres Corea del Norte, tú eres peor que ellos.\n[#28](c28#c-28) ¿Conoces el código penal polaco y mas exactamente lo que puede ser nuestra ley de enjuiciamiento criminal o posiblemente el código penal militar que me da la sensación que es la que se aplica en caso de ESPIONAJE que es de lo que se le acusa? Si es así aclarar cuanto es el tiempo que pueden tener preso a un investigado por ESPIAR para un país extranjero, se supo la causa de su detección desde poco después, ESPIONAJE para Rusia, al tiempo presentaron pruebas al gobierno español, las cuales no se hicieron publicas para poder seguir investigado.\nEs mas puede ser que cuando lo detuvieron en Ucrania le soltaran para no condenar a muerte a un ciudadano con pasaporte europeo e informasen a Polonia par aque lo detuviera un país de le EU.\n[#7](c7#c-7) la tienen tan adentro que es como el que descubre que le han sido infiel y sigue negándolo. Efectivamente era un espía y ahora el tiempo que estuvo entre rejas me parece poco con toda la gente que puso en peligro. Y espero que si finalmente es condenado y vuelve a españa, España lo entregue con un lazo y una patada en el culo\n[#9](c9#c-9) Es como lo de Asange, reveló secretos de EEUU, pero no son formas de tratar de enjuiciarlo y putearlo durante años.\n[#9](c9#c-9) Vestía como una puta e iba provocando. Todo el mundo sabe que es una fresca. Se merececía la violacion y algo más.\n[#19](c19#c-19) simplemente era un espía y de los malos, lo cazaron en Ucrania y le dieron una patada en el culo, lo volvieron a cazar en Polonia y esta vez lo metieron entre rejas. Su papi fue a decirle al Kremlin que o lo ponían en la lista de intercambio o este pactaba con la fiscalía y cantaba la traviata. Lo pusieron en la lista y el mismo Putin le fue a recibir con el resto de espías y asesinos para agradecerle los servicios prestados. Fin.\n[#9](c9#c-9) efectivamente? Pero cuáles han sido las pruebas y sentencias que certifiquen eso?\nQué gente te consta que esta persona puso en peligro?\nVeo mucha certeza en tu comentario, por eso pregunto.\n[#26](c26#c-26) https://www.elmundo.es/internacional/2024/08/07/66b372e8e4d4d84e118b45a0.html\nEl disidente Yashin: \"Supe que Pablo González me espiaba, pero era una caricatura de espía\"\nPero vamos a los hechos\n1 Pablo González no es periodista, no ha cursado ninguna carrera que le capacite ni está colegiado. Pablo González igual que muchos otros freelance (cámaras y fotografo) pues podrán currar para medios de comunicación pero eso no les convierte en periodistas de facto. Por mucho que se haya desvirtuado tanto la palabra que cualquiera con su iPhone se puede considerar periodista.\n2 Pablo González no fue detenido una vez. Primero fue detenido en Ucrania y se le expulsó del país. Luego se le detuvo en Polonia donde a parte tenía una doble vida con otra mujer.\n3 en el momento que lo detienen, España no se pronuncia. Algo bastante raro. Y más viniendo de un país aliado.\n4 Antiguos compañeros de Pablo relatan el ritmo de vida que llevaba, y conozco a bastantes freelance que como él curran con medios de comunicación, y ya te digo que no van por la vida sin mirar en lo que gastan, suele ser bastante precario.\n5 Rusia lo pone en la lista de intercambio, lo cual es sorprendente ya que si no tiene ni pajolera es sumamente extraño que Rusia se preocupe por él y ocupe una plaza.\n6 el mismo Putin fue a recibirlo y le agradeció los servicios prestados. Pablo González con una cara muy sonriente, la típica que tendría cualquiera que se ha comido dos años de trena acusado de ser espía.\n7 Pablo González ha estado cobrando diferentes cantidades de dinero en rublos por parte de su progenitor, que nadie conoce su procedencia o a qué se deben.\n8 Polonia ahora lo ha acusado formalmente de ser un espía, y los cargos ya los conocía su abogado polaco, quiza su abogado español era tan imbécil de no saber de qué le acusaban. O querer ir de listo, a saber. Pero los cargos estaban claros.\nEs evidente que se trata de un espía y ahora empezará a aflorar toda la mierda que tienen en Polonia para acusarlo formalmente.\n[#30](c30#c-30) No hace falta que hagas el esfuerzo, de los Hare Krishna solo puedes esperar que sigan repitiendo su mantra mientras tocan la pandereta.\nNi aunque le hagan a Pablo Gonzales un documental en Amazon prime contándo sus memorias como espía Ruso van a reconocer la humillación de haber defendido a capa y espada a los rusos que se han reído en su cara de semejante pagafantismo.\n[#9](c9#c-9) Aquí lo que hemos denunciado es que un país miembro de la UE se ha follado el estado de derecho. Si había caso, que hubieran seguido los cauces desde el inicio.\nSolo hemos tenido que esperar casi dos años para que haya una acusación de la fiscalia. Eso y que el reo ya esté libre y fuera del país.\nYa debes de conocer la condena de antemano. Y sí, pinta feo el tema, pero insisto: que se sigan los cauces\n[#29](c29#c-29) También se han follado el estado de derecho para dárselo a los americanos de un día a otro montando en un avión para intercambiarlo por espías en Turquía a la potencia rival, pero de eso no oigo quejas. Digo yo que si hubieran seguido los cauces habrian emitido una resolución sobreseyendo el caso y lo habrían liberado en Polonia para que se volviese a su casa.\n[#9](c9#c-9) Aparte de lo que se crea, parezca o se quiera creer sin un proceso judicial, pone de manifiesto la mentira del estado de derecho en Europa.\n[#16](c16#c-16) facil, al único periodista español en Ucrania que nos habría informado entre otras cosas del desfile de payasos nazis que tienen allí organizado antes de que hasta Canadá pidiera oficialmente que dejaran de pasearlos por los parlamentos, mientras aqui Antena3 nos ponía videojuegos o Cadena Ser se inventaba testimonios delirantes de soldados que lanzan granadas a civiles porque sí, hay que matarlo o hacerle la vida imposible.\n[#16](c16#c-16) Precisamente, por eso es un intercambio y no una liberación o un sobreseimiento, si lo hubieran dejado libre de cargos lo habrían soltado en Polonia como a cualquier otro ciudadano en lugar de montarlo en un avión para dejarlo en territorio \"seguro\" para él.\n[#10](c10#c-10) Tan rápido como les permite su ley. Y en un caso de espionaje a favor de un país que amenaza a Polonia continuamente con atacarla y donde presentar cargos podría poner en peligro la investigación. No era el único espía ruso allí:\nMayo 2024\nhttps://www.eldebate.com/internacional/20240521/polonia-detiene-nueve-presuntos-espias-rusos-desmantela-red-sabotaje-kremlin_198777.html\nAgosto 2023\nhttps://www.europapress.es/internacional/noticia-policia-polonia-detiene-16-presuntos-espias-rusos-20230808144832.html",

    "text": "Eden Prairie police look into reports of preschool teacher handing out gummies that made kids drowsy\nPolice are investigating a preschool in Eden Prairie over concerns that a teacher gave kids gummies that made them sleepier than usual.\nThe Eden Prairie Police Department began looking into Jardín Spanish Immersion Academy after receiving a report on March 28 that a female employee had given out gummies before naptime, according to a search warrant.\nParents told police the gummies their children received were “gum drop shaped, bluish purple, have a white sugar coating, and turn their tongue blue,” the filing states. The employee told the kids not to tell anyone about the gummies.\n“Parents had reported their children feeling sleepier and napping during the day when they normally wouldn’t,” the filing states.\nWhen questioned by police on March 31, the employee said she had given Welch’s fruit snacks after class time once and that they did not contain melatonin.\nAn officer reviewed surveillance footage from March 27 with the preschool’s vice president — who has since been promoted to president — and saw the employee get something from her pocket and hold it out with her hand. The filing describes a child taking the item and putting it in their mouth.\nGiving children consumable items was against the preschool’s policy due to the possibility of an allergic reaction or adverse side effects, the filing states.\nAs part of the search warrant, the officer obtained a copy of the Jardin policy handbook, the employee’s personnel file, and surveillance footage of the playground and pre-K classroom to investigate whether the employee “is engaged in ongoing concerning and potentially negligent behavior.”\nIn a statement Wednesday, Jardín said the employee has been placed on administrative leave.\n“We take these allegations very seriously and immediately launched an internal investigation into the matter as soon as we learned of it,” Jardín said.\nThe preschool said it notified the Minnesota Department of Health and is “fully cooperating” with police.\n“The safety and care of our students is our absolute highest priority and any conduct that compromises that commitment is contrary to our values, our policies and our community,” Jardín said. “When we have reason to believe a member of our team is falling short of that standard, we will take immediate and effective corrective action.”\nAs of Wednesday, the employee has not been arrested or charged.",
