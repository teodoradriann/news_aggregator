    "text": "El nivel del Mediterráneo aumenta en las costas tres veces más rápido de lo previsto Roma.- El nivel del mar Mediterráneo está subiendo en la costa tres veces más rápido de lo previsto “y a finales de siglo pondrá en peligro las actividades humanas y las infraestructuras”, según un informe publicado hoy por el Instituto Nacional de Geofísica y Vulcanología italiano (INGV) El informe, en el que también ha colaborado el Radboud Radio Lab del Departamento de Astrofísica de la Universidad de Radboud (Países Bajos), explica que las proyecciones actuales de aumento del nivel del mar, publicadas en 2021 por el Grupo Intergubernamental de Expertos sobre el Cambio Climático (Ipcc) están “subestimadas a lo largo de las costas”. “La subsidencia, es decir, el lento movimiento descendente del suelo debido a causas naturales o antropogénicas, desempeña un papel crucial en la aceleración de la subida del nivel del mar a lo largo de las costas, desencadenada por el calentamiento global desde 1880”, explica Marco Anzidei, investigador del INGV en una nota. “Nuestros análisis muestran que, precisamente debido al hundimiento, en algunas zonas del Mediterráneo el nivel del mar está aumentando casi tres veces más rápido que en zonas estables “, añade Antonio Vecchio, investigador de la Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen y primer autor del estudio. A la luz de estas evidencias, el equipo de investigadores recalculó las proyecciones del IPCC hasta 2150 en 265 zonas del Mediterráneo, correspondientes también a los 51 mareógrafos de las redes internacionales de vigilancia, incluyendo en los análisis datos relativos al hundimiento. “Los resultados muestran diferencias máximas y mínimas con respecto al informe del IPCC que oscilan, respectivamente, entre aproximadamente más 109 cm y menos 77 cm, con un valor medio superior en aproximadamente 8 cm ”, explica Vecchio. Se explica que, según estos datos, “aproximadamente 38.500 km2 de costas mediterráneas – de los cuales aproximadamente 19.000 km2 sólo en el sector norte de la cuenca – pronto estarán más expuestas al riesgo de inundaciones marinas, con los consiguientes mayores impactos sobre el medio ambiente, actividades humanas e infraestructuras”. “Por lo tanto, es necesario tomar medidas concretas para apoyar a las poblaciones costeras, que serán cada vez más vulnerables al aumento del nivel del mar y a los mayores riesgos asociados a él a finales de este siglo y en el futuro” , concluye el informe.

    "text": "Comment: Almost half the world is voting in national elections this year and artificial intelligence is the elephant in the room.\nThere are genuine fears AI-generated or AI-edited deepfakes will potentially manipulate election outcomes not just in the US and UK, but critically in countries such as India.\nFor that reason, the need for highly trained journalists who can produce trusted, accurate and original reporting is firmly in the spotlight.\nread more Business Stuff takes a big risk on Newshub Comment TVNZ – a last bastion of current affairs falls This year has seen an acceleration in the use of AI technologies, which can boost legitimate political campaigns but also be employed by bad actors to influence outcomes. These tools, combined with lack of regulation on social media platforms, is a grave worry for anyone who supports democracy.\nBut for those of us preparing the next generation of journalists, it’s a challenge to further enhance the technical and soft skills that lead to excellent public interest journalism.\nThe deepfakes fear AI has been used for more than a decade in the US, providing automated earthquake warnings for the Los Angeles Times . But it is now being used by journalists in far smaller newsrooms to, among other things, generate quick rewrites of up to 50 press releases at a time.\nThe European Union is leading the way in developing ethical guidelines for dealing with AI that are “human centric”. There are seven requirements considered key in the EU for achieving trustworthy AI. They include human agency and oversight; robustness and safety; societal and environmental wellbeing, and accountability.\nBut globally, people are concerned. Software company Adobe has just released a Future of Trust Study , which surveyed more than 6000 people across the US, UK, France and Germany about their experiences encountering misinformation online and concerns about the impact of generative AI.\nThe study shows more than 80 percent of respondents in each nation were concerned the content they consume online was vulnerable to being altered to mislead or deceive.\nA significant number said it was becoming difficult to verify if the content they were consuming online was trustworthy, and most believed that misinformation and harmful deepfakes would impact future elections.\nThey generally believed governments and technology companies should work together to protect election integrity against deepfakes and misinformation.\nThose surveyed were quite right to be fearful, with the recent Solomon Islands election awash with fake information.\nThe role of verified journalists While Australia might be lagging with regulation around AI, it has led the way in forcing big tech companies to support the provision of journalism through its news bargaining code by making them pay local news publishers for news content available on their platforms.\nDespite Australia’s world-leading laws, Meta has already warned it will remove news rather than support its continued existence within Facebook. It’s a move being labelled anti-democratic by Australian politicians.\nHaving access to balanced news and information, prepared by well-trained journalists, is one of the best ways to fight misinformation and disinformation spread across social media.\nBut that trust only comes when the news is fair and transparent, represents all in the community, and is provided by people who sign up to an ethical framework.\nIt’s one reason academics are pushing for accreditation of journalists in Australia so those who sign up to an ethical code of conduct and complaints process can be differentiated from those who do not.\nWhile journalists certainly have a lot more to do to rebuild relationships with audiences, that job is almost impossible if we cannot clearly identify who is, and more importantly, who is not a credible and ethical journalist.\nRethinking the news business model Around the globe, governments, philanthropists and businesses that care about democracy are continuing to look for ways to save the flailing news industry.\nDespite a range of initiatives to support journalism, from tax breaks for hiring journalists in New York, to philanthropic grants, the number of news deserts continues to rise with the closure of long-running newspapers like the 125-year-old Barrier Truth in Broken Hill, in far west New South Wales.\nAustralia’s media market is being tracked by the Public Interest Journalism Initiative, which has found much resilience in the provision of news across most local government areas with few areas that have no reporting at all.\nHowever, there is very little court reporting in regional Australia, and while regional and city governments are generally well covered, that is less true of regional shires and metropolitical councils.\nCEOs more concerned about the financial bottom line than they are about the provision of news to the public are continuing to close operations.\nNew Zealand’s long-running television news programme, Newshub , is due to close mid-year with the loss of 200 jobs thanks to a decision by the US media conglomerate Warner Bros Discovery.\nThe decision was set to leave the state-owned TVNZ network as the only source of free TV news in the country until a last-minute deal by the NZ media outlet Stuff was struck to provide another English-language news programme, albeit slimmed down.\nLegislation is often slow to catch up with technological innovations but, in a year packed with elections, the stakes have never been so high to keep pace with emerging threats.\nThe financial pressures on the media industry are not disappearing but, with proactive government support and savvy work from those dedicated to preserving democracy, a way forward is tenable.\nAlexandra Wake is an associate professor of journalism at RMIT University and the elected president of the Journalism Education and Research Association of Australia. She is an active leader, educator and researcher in journalism.\nOriginally published under Creative Commons by 360info ™.",

    "text": "Cole Strange Nears Patriots Return After Knee Injury Recovery\nCole Strange, the New England Patriots' starting left guard, is advancing in his recovery from a torn patellar tendon, which has kept him on the physically unable to perform list since December. He is now in the final phase of rehabilitation, focusing on football-specific drills. With the offensive line struggling in his absence, his return could provide the much-needed boost the team is looking for.\n- Cole Strange started all 27 games he played over the last two seasons.\n- He has been in rehabilitation since undergoing surgery for his injury almost a year ago.\n- The Patriots have cycled through multiple players at the left guard position during Strange's absence.\n- Current left guard Michael Jordan has struggled, leading to potential changes in the lineup.\nStrange's return to practice is imminent, which could lead to adjustments in the offensive line. There's speculation about whether he might reclaim his starting spot or fill in at center if necessary.\nBottom LineReintegrating Cole Strange into the Patriots' lineup could revitalize their struggling offensive line, benefitting both the team and his personal career trajectory.\nRead more at Pats Pulpit\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",

    "text": "Los Steelers se metieron a los playoffs de la NFL – Foto: AFP\nDados por muertos a mediados de diciembre, los Pittsburgh Steelers regresan a los playoffs de todos modos.\nPittsburgh aseguró un puesto de comodín el domingo cuando Tennessee derrotó a Jacksonville, dándole a los Steelers (10-7) un lugar en los playoffs que parecía poco probable luego de una racha de tres juegos que incluyó derrotas ante los humildes Arizona y New England.\nLee también Red Bull presume intenso entrenamiento de Checo Pérez en la pretemporada de la Fórmula 1\nEl entrenador Mike Tomlin insertó al tercer jugador Mason Rudolph como mariscal de campo después de ser derrotado en Indianápolis el 16 de diciembre, y Rudolph respondió ayudando a Pittsburgh a lograr tres victorias consecutivas sobre Cincinnati , Seattle y el campeón de la AFC Norte, Baltimore , el sábado\nLos Steelers serán el sexto o séptimo sembrado en la AFC, pendiente del resultado del partido del domingo por la noche de Buffalo contra Miami. Una victoria de los Dolphins enviaría a Pittsburgh a Kansas City el próximo fin de semana, y una victoria de los Bills llevaría a los Steelers a Buffalo. Si Miami-Buffalo empata, los Dolphins recibirán a los Steelers.\nPittsburgh no ha ganado un partido de playoffs desde que venció a Kansas City en la ronda divisional de la postemporada de 2016. Los Steelers han perdido cada uno de sus últimos cuatro juegos de playoffs de manera decisiva, cayendo ante New England en el Campeonato de la AFC 2016, Jacksonville en la ronda divisional en 2017, Cleveland en la primera ronda en 2020 y Kansas City en la primera ronda en 2021.\nPittsburgh tendrá que seguir adelante sin el apoyador externo estrella TJ Watt. El perenne candidato al All-Pro y Jugador Defensivo del Año dejó la victoria sobre Baltimore con una lesión en la rodilla que se espera lo deje fuera de juego indefinidamente.\nLos Steelers han soportado una temporada al revés que incluyó un comienzo de 6-3 a pesar de ser superados en cada juego. Luego perdieron cuatro de cinco, incluyendo una derrota ante Cleveland el 19 de noviembre que llevó al asediado coordinador ofensivo Matt Canada al despido dos días después.\nLa ofensiva se animó momentáneamente en una victoria sobre Cincinnati, pero el mariscal de campo titular Kenny Pickett se lesionó el tobillo derecho en el segundo cuarto contra Arizona el 3 de diciembre. Mitch Trubisky tomó el control y fue en gran medida ineficaz cuando los Steelers cayeron ante los Cardinals, Patriots y Colts. quedar fuera del panorama de los playoffs.\nTomlin recurrió a Rudolph, uno de los jugadores con más antigüedad en el equipo que había pasado más de dos años enterrado en la banca, en busca de una chispa. Proporcionó uno que ha impulsado a los Steelers de regreso a los playoffs.\nRudolph ha lanzado para 719 yardas y tres touchdowns sin una intercepción, con Pickett, ahora completamente recuperado de una cirugía de tobillo, como suplente el sábado en Baltimore.\nSi bien Tomlin dijo la semana pasada que esperaría para decidir quién recibiría el balón en caso de que la temporada de Pittsburgh se extendiera más allá de la Semana 18, es casi seguro que Rudolph tendrá la oportunidad de continuar con su improbable renacimiento contra los Bills o los Dolphins.",
