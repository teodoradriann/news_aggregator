    "title": "Xiaomi Unveils Its First EV, the SU7, With Ambition to Be China’s Porsche or Tesla | Tech News",
    "text": "Xiaomi Unveils Its First EV, the SU7, With Ambition to Be China’s Porsche or Tesla Xiaomi unveiled the company’s first EV, the SU7, declaring ambitions to become a top global carmaker and compete against Tesla Inc. and Porsche AG. The billionaire co-founder of Thursday, declaring ambitions to become a top global carmaker in 15 to 20 years and compete against Tesla Inc. and Porsche AG. The SU7, which stands for Speed Ultra, rolled onto a stage at the China National Convention Center in Beijing with no drivers visible, ending a presentation by CEO and co-founder Lei Jun in front of thousands of people. Lei spent hours detailing the car's features, which include a range of up to 800 kilometers (500 miles) on a single charge, adjustable spoilers, unique colors and a top speed of 265 kilometers an hour. The five-seat sedan will be powered by batteries from Chinese market leaders Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. and BYD Co., depending on whether it has a single or dual motor configuration. Xiaomi's EV foray is a $10 billion wager by Lei that his company can shake up the transport sector much as it did smartphones a decade ago. Lei, also a prolific venture investor, has called it his final entrepreneurial bet.

But in the time since first announcing his EV plans in 2021, the regulatory landscape and competition in China — the world's biggest car market — have changed significantly. Beijing has been limiting manufacturing permits to new market entrants, which means Xiaomi has to partner with state-owned Beijing Automotive Group Co. to produce its EVs. State subsidies that reimbursed consumers with as much as 60,000 yuan ($8,440) for an EV purchase ended in 2022. The SU7 is also vying for attention in a market that has hundreds of models from dozens of brands. Lei has previously said Xiaomi intends the SU7 to rival Porsche's Taycan Turbo in terms of performance and Tesla's Model S in technology features. The Model S starts at 698,900 yuan and the Taycan at 898,000 yuan, which is much higher than the medium price bracket of 200,000 yuan to 300,000 yuan that many expect the SU7 to fall into. Xiaomi hasn't yet said how much the SU7 will cost. Lei hinted that it wouldn't be 99,000 yuan as some on social media had joked. Cars with the same specs often go for 400,000 yuan or more, he said. Tesla has sold fewer than 200 Model S cars in China since revamping it this year, while Porsche has delivered about 3,600 Taycan family EVs in the country in 2023, according to the China Automotive Technology and Research Center. The SU7 is due to go on sale next year and can go from 0 to 100 kph in 2.78 seconds, Lei said. It will come with a motor that has 21,000 revolutions a minute, which he said is higher than the Model S and Taycan Turbo. Xiaomi's factory uses gigacasting manufacturing pioneered by Tesla, developing a 9,100 ton system that it calls hypercasting. Xiaomi, once known as a producer of cheap smartphones, has been fighting to sustain growth in an increasingly saturated and plateauing global market. Before the September quarter, the company had posted a sales decline in every three-month period since 2021. Now, it is seeking to challenge not just other EV makers but also newer entrants like Huawei Technologies Co. in an arena where it has demonstrated little unique expertise. Lei said he had driven 150 different cars since committing to making the SU7. Xiaomi's shares gave up earlier gains to fall 0.3% Thursday afternoon. They rose 4.1% Wednesday. Lei, who has dubbed the SU7 a “performance beast” on X, has signaled Xiaomi won't resort to undercutting competitors to get his vehicle off the ground. The car is aimed at people who has a penchant for technology, performance and taste, he said. He has also paid tribute to competitors on social media, including BYD, XPeng Inc., Li Auto Inc. and Huawei, calling them pioneers of China's new energy vehicle industry. In a Wednesday post on social media platform Weibo, XPeng's CEO He Xiaopeng said he welcomed Xiaomi joining the automaking family and wished the company great sales for 2024.

    "text": "NATO praises model balancing of Lithuania's defence spending that ticks every box in NATO recommendations\nRepublic of Lithuania - Ministry of National Defence\n2024-03-08\nInternational cooperation | Security and defense policy\nMultilateral consultations with NATO Allies were held in Brussels this week to assess how Lithuania succeeds to meet its NATO commitments. NATO planners overviewed the progress Lithuania had made in living up to its commitments and especially highlighted the national ambitions set to complement the overall NATO capabilities in the future. NATO experts underscored the exemplary budget balancing that fell in line with NATO recommendations and distributed the funds properly across the areas of personnel needs, major weaponry procurement and sophisticated system sustainment throughout their lifecycle.\nAccording to consultations participants, Lithuania's latest defence spending and capability and infrastructure development plans were not just welcome but also set a role model for other NATO Allies. Lithuania's current defence budget markedly exceeds the minimum goals agreed to at the NATO Summit in Vilnius, i.e. 2 percent of GDP. Lithuania's defence spending this year amounts to 2.77 percent of GDP and targets are set on 3 percent.\nAnother aspect looked into was the challenge of potential recruit and servicemember career reluctance in some of the Allies and Lithuania's best practices in tackling the issue. Lithuania has approved a comprehensive package including such servicemember-oriented measures as increased compensations for commuting to service sites and lodging charge, qualification, specific duty or service allowance increase, as well as allowances for international deployments and salary rise by tens of percent. NATO representatives were particularly appreciative of Lithuania's proficiency in offering an appealing package of motivating measures for servicemembers and mixed recruitment model that focuses not only on career military but also volunteer and recruit servicemembers.\nThe Allies thanked Lithuania for the continued assistance to Ukraine and underscored the importance of the demining coalition led by Lithuania and Iceland. 22 states have already joined the initiative.\nNATO representatives also have noted the weighty contribution Lithuania makes to other multilateral and bilateral formats: the UK-led Joint Expeditionary Force, cooperation in NORDEFCO, trilateral Lithuanian-Polish-Ukrainian Brigade LITPOLUKRBRIG and the 3B, three Baltic states, format.\n|\n|\nNEWSLETTER\n|Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list|\n|\n||\n|",

Allen thought Skipper reported as an eligible receiver even though big No. 70 clearly did not.\nOn Sunday, Skipper did more than just declare as an eligible receiver. He ran a rout and caught a pass in this quarter of Detroit’s game against the Minnesota Vikings. Skipper gained four yards on the pass.\nAfter losing tight end Sam LaPorta to injury earlier in the game, the Ford Field crowd needed a lift. Skipper’s catch resulted in the loudest cheer for a non-scoring play all afternoon.\nSkipper also threw a nice block on David Montgomery’s touchdown run to cap the drive.

    "text": "WTVO Rockford Bird infected with H5N1 found in Ogle County John Clark Thu, December 19, 2024 at 9:35 PM UTC 2 min read\nOGLE COUNTY, Ill. (WTVO) — The Ogle County Health Department has confirmed a bird found in Rochelle has tested positive for H5N1 or bird flu.\nBird flu can infect poultry and other domestic animals, but does not normally infect humans.\nThe virus was first detected in U.S. dairy cattle in March. Since then, bird flu has been confirmed in at least 866 herds in 16 states.\nMore than 60 people in eight states have been infected, with mostly mild illnesses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Louisiana Department of Health said a resident from the southwestern portion of the state had been hospitalized after exposure to sick and dead birds suspected of having the virus.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement H5N1 is a virus that causes respiratory illness in birds.\nThe outbreak has resulted in 60 cases of the flu in humans. 37 of those cases were transmitted from infected cattle.\nUniversity of Illinois Professor of Animal Sciences Dr. Jim Drackley said those infections are primarily from raw milk consumption.\n“I would say the risk to humans is incredibly small, at this time, from the dairy products that we’ve consumed from stores,” Drackley said. “I would always recommend that people don’t consume raw milk, in which case the virus could still be there.”\nThis week, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) began mandatory testing of the nation’s milk supply for traces of H5N1, after bird flu was first detected in U.S. dairy cows in March.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Since then, it has been found in 832 dairy herds across 16 states, including Iowa, Minnesota, and Michigan.\nNo human-to-human transmission has occurred in the U.S.\nOfficials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stressed that the virus poses low risk to the general public.\nThe Ogle County Health Department reminds the public not to handle wild birds that are sick or found dead, and say the public should call 815-562-6976 if a dead bird is found on their property.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "text": "FAIRFIELD COUNTY, S.C. — The Midlands was hit with severe storms Wednesday night,\n[with Fairfield County being one of the most impacted](/article/weather/early-morning-storms-cause-kershaw-county-school-delays-damage-in-midlands-southcarolina-weather/101-68510271-9787-4688-907e-2991df07486e). County officials say clean up began early this morning with crews restoring power and clearing roads.\n“Around 3 am, we were woken up with the rain, the wind and the thunder,” Jennifer Ledley said.\nLedley is one of many residents who was impacted by the storm that came through the Midlands Wednesday night.\n“The storm seemed to pass through, it didn’t linger overhead, it seemed like it past through within a half an hour to an hour so I was thankful that it was a quick storm that moved rather quickly so that was good that we got our power back by the time we had to get ready for work,” she said.\nAs the storm passed through Fairfield county, many residents lost power with several trees knocking down power lines.\n“It kind of came out of nowhere, it kind of surprised everyone, everyone woke up at 3 this morning with the tornado warning that went off I talked to our emergency management director she said at the peak we lost maybe 200 people who were out of power at one time,” Gene Stephens said.\nStephens is the public information officer for Fairfield county, he says they prepare for heavy storms like these.\n“Once that storm hits our emergency management team goes into activation, she's looking for updates, our public works department when they come in they're checking all the roads that we maintain to make sure that there's no debris so they're kind of doing a scouring search to get a few calls you know to help you know give them leads and stuff like that but basically they go around looking for areas that need to be cleaned up,” he said.\nThe SC Department of Transportation says they cleared about 50 trees in area.\n“We have large areas in the county where if a line gets cut or gets interfered with, you’ll have a whole section that will be out of power. We do get that a good bit but our linemen are amazing they get stuff back up very quickly,” Stephens said.\nAround 3 pm Thursday, there were still 54 homes in the area without power, according to county officials.\n“They would call their power company directly and report the outage, even if you think okay, well all my neighbors out they already called go ahead call. That way it shows if you have a big block of houses that are out of power, that gives them a priority and you come and take care of that area,” Stephens said.\nAs of 4pm Thursday, SCDOT told News 19 they cleared all the trees down in the area.",

    "text": "La UAL es pionera en formar a estudiantes de Medicina a través de una plataforma virtual de MIR\nSalud\nUn convenio de la Biblioteca Nicolás Salmerón permite a los estudiantes de tercero de Medicina en adelante hacer uso gratuito de MIR Asturias\nMartínez-González, doctor honoris causa de la UAL y aliado de lujo de la Cátedra de Dieta Mediterránea\nLa Biblioteca Nicolás Salmerón de la Universidad de Almería ha firmado un acuerdo de colaboración para la contratación de los cursos intensivos y el material de MIR Asturias, una plataforma muy relevante para la formación del estudiantado de Medicina.\nMIR Asturias se dedica, entre otras actividades, a la preparación de médicos que han de presentarse a las pruebas selectivas de acceso a las plazas de formación sanitaria especializada para médicos, convocadas por el Ministerio de Sanidad del Gobierno de España y dispone de aplicaciones propias para adquirir conocimientos en medicina.\n“La Universidad de Almería se convierte así en la primera universidad pública en firmar un convenio de estas características. Se trata de un hito único de colaboración al que se ha llegado después de valorar las propuestas de otras academias de MIR (Médico Interno Residente) a nivel nacional”, ha explicado Pablo Román, decano de la Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud.\nJunto a él han estado en la presentación del acuerdo Gracia Castro, coordinadora del Grado en Medicina; Arsenio Gutiérrez, director de la Biblioteca Nicolás Salmerón; Alberto García, director general de MIR Asturias; José Curbelo, coordinador académico de MIR Asturias; Vanesa Pérez, relaciones institucionales en Andalucía de MIR Asturias y Juan José Moreno, jefe del Servicio de Recursos de la Biblioteca Nicolás Salmerón.\n“Gracias a esta plataforma, los estudiantes de tercero, en adelante, podrán mejorar significativamente su formación, pero, además, servirá como complemento a los profesores que también tendrán acceso a la misma”, ha explicado Gracia Castro. Por su parte, Alberto García, director general de MIR Asturias, ha explicado que se trata “de la principal academia de formación de MIR. Ostentamos el récord de haber formado a los número uno del MIR de las cuatro últimas promociones y el 85% de nuestros alumnos se sitúan en los 1.000 primeros puestos del MIR”.\nEl acuerdo firmado con la Biblioteca permite la utilización de su plataforma virtual denominada MedPlus para que los alumnos de Medicina, a partir de tercero, puedan usarla de manera gratuita. Este tipo de plataformas son habituales en las editoriales clásicas de libros científicos, como es McGraw Hill o Elsevier.\nActualmente, la mayoría de los libros de medicina vienen insertos como ebooks en plataformas. El estudiante puede consultar y trabajar con ellos por licencias colectivas que compran las universidades a través de las bibliotecas. “En el caso de MIR Asturias, se ha contratado una licencia colectiva para el uso gratuito de la plataforma por parte de los estudiantes y profesores del Grado de Medicina de la UAL que podrán acceder a sus libros en formato papel y a clases virtuales en las que se explican los conceptos más preguntados en el examen MIR”, ha indicado Arsenio Gutiérrez, director de la biblioteca Nicolás Salmerón.\nDe esta forma, los estudiantes tendrán a disposición un banco de preguntas de MIR de todos los años por especialidades y podrán hacer simulacros de examen. También podrán ver vídeos tutoriales de temas concretos y manuales-resumen por especialidades con los que podrán trabajar. El acuerdo para el uso de esta plataforma se prolongará hasta el 31 de agosto de 2027.\nTambién te puede interesar\nLo último",

    "title": "7 Chiranjeevis in Hinduism: Where are they now? | The Times of India",
    "text": "In Hindu religion, there are 7 people who were given the boon of immortality. Immortals, or Chiranjeevis, were blessed or punished with eternal life by different Gods according to their acts. It is said that these Chiranjeevis still roam on Earth and live among people but not everyone can see them. Here we list the 7 immortals and where they are believed to be now. . Lord Hanuman, Shri Ram’s biggest devotee was given the boon of immortality before Lord Ram went back to his abode. According to various beliefs, Hanuman ji can be found where the name of Lord Ram is being chanted. But, according to scriptures, it is also said that Lord Hanuman lives in the Gandhamadan mountains, meditating on the name of Lord Ram and ready to help any of his devotees who need him.Some people also say that he roams the forests and mountains, like the Himalayas and Kishkindha. Ashwathama, the son of Dronacharya, was the one who unleashed the Brahmastra during the Mahabharat and was cursed with immortality and suffering by Lord Krishna. As per the curse, he is forced to wander the Earth until the end of Kalyug and he shall till that time bear the pain of his wounds and the burden of his actions during the war. Many legends and tales say that Ashwathama roams the forests and desolate places, especially around the Narmada river. King Mahabali is also considered to be an immortal of Hinduism and was given the boon of visiting his people once a year, during the festival of Onam. According to beliefs and scriptures, Mahabali was pushed to Patala and now lives there, but he comes up to Earth during the festival to bless his people. . Veda Vyasa, the sage who wrote and brought together the Vedas and authored the Mahabharata, is believed to live in seclusion somewhere in the Himalayas. It is believed that Ved Vyasa lives in the Badra region, way ahead of Badrinath, in a place that cannot be reached by humans.People believe that he still comes to places where Mahabharata paath is going on and his presence can be felt in spiritual activities. . Vibhishana, the brother of Ravana, who went against him to join Lord Ram’s army and side with Dharma was also given the boon of immortality. Many believe that Vibhishana is also a Chiranjeevi and was given the reins of Lanka after Ravana's defeat. Kripacharya, one of the great teachers and warriors in the Mahabharata, was given the boon of immortality for his dedication to the study and teaching of the Vedas. It is said that Kripacharya became the only person who stayed true to his ideals and did not use any ‘Divyastras’. He always obeyed the rules of war and remained steadfast and impartial. It is said that he will live till the end of Kalyug, but will never be known to the human eye and will forever live in desolation. . Parashuram, the warrior-sage, was the one responsible for ridding the world of corrupt Kshatriya rulers. Once he completed his task, Parashuram retired to a life of penance and teaching. It is widely believed that he resides in the Mahendragiri mountains and in other remote hermitages, changing his places constantly. . \" } Back to Top",
