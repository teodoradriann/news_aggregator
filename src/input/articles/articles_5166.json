    "title": "$750 a month, no questions asked, improved the lives of homeless people",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES — If 100 homeless people were given $750 per month for a year, no questions asked, what would they spend it on?\nThat question was at the core of a controlled study conducted by a San Francisco-based nonprofit and the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work.\nThe results were so promising that the researchers decided to publish results after only six months. The answer: food, 36.6%; housing, 19.5%; transportation, 12.7%; clothing, 11.5%; and health care, 6.2%, leaving only 13.6% uncategorized.\nThose who got the stipend were less likely to be unsheltered after six months and able to meet more of their basic needs than a control group that got no money, and half as likely as the control group to have an episode of being unsheltered.\n“I felt there was enough interest and the initial findings were compelling enough that it was important to get those results out,” said Benjamin Henwood, director of the Center for Homelessness, Housing and Health Equity Research at the Dworak-Peck School, who led the study.\nPeople are also reading…\n“It may not be earth-shattering that providing money is going to help meet basic needs, but I do think it dispels this myth that people will use money for illicit purposes,” Henwood said. “We weren’t finding that in the study.”\nAbout 2% of the total went to alcohol, cigarettes and drug expenses — the largest portion of which was cigarettes, Henwood said.\nThe participants submit monthly reports on their spending and are surveyed in more detail quarterly.\nA follow-up report will be published after participants have received the funds for a full year. But Henwood said the main findings were robust enough that they were unlikely to change.\nThe study arose from Miracle Messages, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that sends volunteers to the streets and shelters to befriend homeless people and try to make connections with the loved ones who lost contact with them. Next founder and chief executive Kevin F. Adler started Miracle Friends, matching homeless people to volunteer phone buddies for weekly calls.\nThat evolved into Miracle Money when volunteers began asking Adler whether it was OK to give their buddies a few dollars.\n“You asked me to be a friend to this person, but they don’t know what they’re going to eat tonight,” Adler said they would tell him.\nAdler didn’t think the volunteers should hand out their own money. But the idea of cash support appealed to him.\nAfter a pilot showed promise, Adler got a grant to expand to Los Angeles. He hired two recruiters to canvass homeless shelters. They enlisted more than 200 clients who met the criteria of being at least 18 years old and homeless and expressed interest in having a phone buddy.\nRather than just give money away, Adler hoped to document its effect. He teamed up with Henwood, who devised the controlled study. The participants were divided randomly into two groups. One group of 103 received stipends. The others were told they were on a waiting list.\nAfter six months, only 12% of those who received funds reported being unsheltered at any time in the prior month, a dramatic decrease from 30% at the outset. Those on the waiting list also reported fewer unsheltered episodes, but by a much smaller margin, from 28% to 23%.\nThe cash recipients also said they were better able to meet their basic needs. On a scale of 1 (completely) to 5 (not at all), they dropped from about 3.75 on average to just over 3.25. The control group did not budge from 3.75.\nAmong those receiving the funds, some found permanent housing, even though the money fell far below average rents in the area, Henwood said.\n“It seems like it’s opening up possibilities in different ways,” he said. “They might have a friend or relative that may not be willing to support them completely, but if they have something to contribute that opens up a room.”\nIn other cases, the money created opportunities, even for people who remained unsheltered.\n“I spent a lot of the money on food on the go,” one participant told the researchers. “Simple, cheap things like bean and cheese burritos. I eat on the run while I bike/work for DoorDash. I also bought a membership to REI, so I could get my bike fixed for free.”\n“It’s not a single path forward,” Henwood said. “It’s a lot of resourcefulness and creativity.”\n20 facts about homelessness in the US\n20 facts about homelessness in the US\nAccording to HUD, there were 582,462 people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. in January 2022\nThe U.S. has seen a 0.3% increase in homelessness since 2020\nConversely, the U.S. has seen an 8.6% decrease in homelessness since 2010\nExperts from HUD believe that resources from the American Rescue Plan directed toward homelessness assistance lessened the impact of COVID-19 on homelessness\nThe end of the federal eviction moratorium in August 2021 made millions of Americans' housing situations more precarious during the long tail of the COVID-19 pandemic\nAs of August 2022, one year after the federal eviction moratorium was lifted, nearly 12% of Americans experienced a rent increase of $250 or more per month\nThe marked increase in rental prices during COVID-19 likely contributed to the recent rise in homelessness\nHUD's Emergency Rental Assistance program received more than 12 million applications for assistance between August 2021 and January 2022\nA greater proportion of people experiencing homelessness were unsheltered in 2022 compared to 2020\n40% of all people experiencing homelessness in the U.S. during 2022 were unsheltered\nChronic homelessness has increased 15.5% since 2020\nVeteran homelessness has decreased by 11% since 2020 and more than 50% since 2010\nFamily and youth homelessness have both decreased since 2020\n50,767 families with children experienced homelessness in 2022\nSince 2020, unaccompanied youth homelessness has decreased by 12%\n6,398 parenting youth taking care of 7,898 children experienced homelessness in 2022, down 13% since 2020\nIn 2022, 37% of people experiencing homelessness identified as Black, while only 12% of the overall U.S. population identifies as Black\nFrom 2020 to 2022, the number of people who identified as Hispanic or Latino who experienced homelessness rose by 8%\nThe number of people who identify as Hispanic and experienced unsheltered homelessness in 2022 rose 16% since 2020",

It has since been reduced twice, first to $23.8 million, then again to its current price point of $19,995,000, according to The Toronto Star.\nMean Girls fans will recall exterior shots of the home’s lavish facade, as Regina George and the Plastics pull up to the front door in her convertible.\nThe listing describes the house as having a “soaring cathedral reception hall,” and “18,276 sq. ft. of living space as well as a detached coach house suite.”\nThe house also boasts staff quarters, a gym, spa and swimming pool, a tennis court, heated floors, a billiards table, a total of 26 parking spots and four additional below-grade bedrooms – on top of the above-grade nine.\nA musical remake of Mean Girls is set to hit movie theatres on January 12, unfortunately, Regina’s iconic house didn’t cut.",

    "text": "'One of the biggest milestones in life' reached for Warden grads\nWARDEN – Warden High School held its graduation ceremony last Friday to celebrate its students as they move on from high school and into their futures.\n“To the class of 2025, we did it. But more importantly, you did,” said Miliany Pruneda, Warden High School’s valedictorian. “You have accomplished one of the biggest milestones in life, high school graduation.”\nPruneda thanked her family for all the support and motivation that they have given her throughout her journey. She said her greatest motivation in earning the title of valedictorian came from her brother, whom she saw pushing himself every day.\n“I did what I could to be my best and this was my best,” said Pruneda.\nHer parents, Omar and Belinda Pruneda, are both extremely proud of her efforts in graduating and achieving valedictorian.\nMiliany said she plans on attending Washington State University to study Elementary School Education this fall. There, she hopes to get an English Language Learning endorsement and obtain her master's degree.\nGraciela Castillo said she wanted to give thanks to the faculty at the school for the time and energy they put into creating an environment that allowed the class to thrive in achieving better futures for themselves.\nOne of the greatest memories she has taken from her time in high school is her part in working on the mural they created at the elementary school in Warden.\n“Having all the kids and teachers come walking by the hallway and saying, ‘Oh my gosh, I want to do that,’” she said. “It really makes me happy seeing that I’ve hopefully inspired many other people to do the same thing.”\nCastillo said her love of art comes from her fascination with ancient Roman architecture while she took an independent study class in TRIO. She plans on attending the University of Idaho to get her master’s in architecture along with a minor in interior design, and afterward, she hopes to make a trip to Rome to visit the Pantheon, which has become her inspiration.\nFor some, the graduation brought both happy and sad feelings, such as for Yaretzi Catalan Ayala.\n“I feel really happy, but really emotional because I’m going to miss high school and my old teachers,” she said.\nOne of the moments she recalls being very proud of from her time in high school was her efforts in cross country as she pushed through her own struggles and still accomplished her goals.\n“It was a hard time doing cross country and I feel really accomplished that I did it,” she said.\nAnthony Gutierrez said that at the time, the feeling of finally being out of school hadn’t fully hit him yet.\n“It just feels amazing,\" he said. “I knew I was going to make it and just the hard work in the classroom, outside the classroom, everything, it all paid off to this day,”\nAt the end of her speech, Pruneda said the quote that their class chose came from Tim McGraw, where he said, “Chase your dreams, but always know the road that’ll lead you home again.” Pruneda said that the most important thing the class can do as they move forward is to remember where they came from and cherish the lifelong connections and friendships made along the way.\n“Now we are sitting here at the end of our high school journey, and I know many of us are starting to feel so many emotions about starting our new lives and that’s OK because it’s part of the process,” said Pruneda. “The best advice I could give to you is to close your eyes, breathe and believe in yourself because I know you can do it.”",

    "text": "È morto il rettore della Cattolica Anelli, il Papa: ha promosso i valori cristiani\nVatican News\nÈ morto ieri sera, 23 maggio, a Milano in circostanze ancora da chiarire il rettore dell'Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Francesco Anelli. Aveva 60 anni; il corpo è stato trovato nel cortile interno del palazzo in cui abitava. Secondo quanto ricostruito dai carabinieri - riferisce l'Ansa - il rettore si sarebbe lanciato dal sesto piano. Dal 2013 alla guida dell’Ateneo, era al suo terzo mandato prossimo alla scadenza.\nTelegramma del Papa\nAppresa la notizia del \"tragico decesso\", il Papa - si legge in un telegramma a firma del cardinale segretario di Stato, Pietro Parolin, indirizzato all'Università Cattolica e della Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS - esprime \"la sua vicinanza alla mamma, ai congiunti come pure all'intera famiglia dell'Ateneo e della Fondazione\". Ricordando \"l'impegno per la promozione dei valori cristiani in ambito universitario, favorendo il dialogo con le nuove generazioni\", Francesco affida Anelli alla misericordia divina e \"mentre invoca per quanti piangono la sua scomparsa il conforto della fede e della speranza crisitana\", invia la benedizione apostolica. Il Pontefice aggiunge pure \"l'espressione della mia partecipazione al lutto con un ricordo dell'altare\"\nCosternazione da Università e Fondazione Gemelli\n“Profonda costernazione\" la esprime pure in una nota la Comunità dell’Università Cattolica e della Fondazione Gemelli, alla quale, si legge, Franco Anelli \"ha dedicato la propria opera e l'intera sua vita\". Ateneo e Fondazione si raccolgono \"nel compianto e nella preghiera, esprimendo il più sentito cordoglio alla sua mamma e ai suoi cari”.\nIl cordoglio della CEI\nAnche il presidente della CEI, il cardinale Matteo Maria Zuppi, si unisce al dolore collettivo “per la tragica scomparsa del Magnifico Rettore” Anelli. “In questo momento di sgomento, a nome dell’Episcopato italiano – si legge in un comunicato -, esprimo cordoglio alla sua mamma, ai suoi cari e alla comunità tutta dell’Ateneo e del Policlinico, cui ha dedicato la sua esistenza. Assicuro la preghiera della nostra Chiesa, affidando il caro professor Anelli alla misericordia del Padre”.\nUna lunga carriera\nNato nel 1963 a Piacenza, Anelli era giurista e un avvocato. Laureato in Giurisprudenza nella Sede della Cattolica di Milano, dopo il dottorato di ricerca in Diritto commerciale, è divenuto professore associato di Istituzioni di Diritto privato presso la facoltà di Economia e commercio nel 1993, e quindi professore straordinario nella facoltà di Giurisprudenza dell'Università degli Studi di Parma nel 1996.\nNel 1998 diventa cassazionista dopo aver conseguito il dottorato di ricerca in diritto commerciale e l'esame per l'accesso all'avvocatura. Ha insegnato diritto civile prima nella sede piacentina della Cattolica, successivamente, dopo la nomina a rettore, aveva iniziato a seguire il corso di Istituzioni di diritto privato a Milano. Autore di diverse monografie e decine di articoli nell’ambito del diritto civile. È stato professore associato di Istituzioni di Diritto privato presso la facoltà di Economia e commercio nel 1993, e quindi professore straordinario nella facoltà di Giurisprudenza dell'Università degli Studi di Parma nel 1996. Inoltre era vice-presidente della Fondazione E4Impact, e tra i componenti del Consiglio di Amministrazione della Fondazione Policlinico Universitario “A. Gemelli” IRCCS e di “Avvenire Nuova Editoriale Italiana S.p.A”.\nIl professor Anelli è stato l’ottavo Rettore nella storia dell’Ateneo fondato da Padre Gemelli nel 1921. Il 13 maggio 2022 Papa Francesco aveva nominato Franco Anelli consultore della Congregazione per l’Educazione cattolica.\nUltimo aggiornamento alle ore 14 del 24 maggio 2024\nGrazie per aver letto questo articolo.
