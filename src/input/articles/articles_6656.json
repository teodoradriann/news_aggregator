    "text": "While the global cryptocurrency market rebounds from a recent decline, as the market cap rises by almost 2%, Bonk (BONK), the pioneering dog-themed coin on the Solana blockchain, has experienced a notable price decrease. As of January 29, 2025, BONK is priced at $0.00002531, reflecting a drop of 17.60% in the last week.\nThis drop follows BONK hitting its peak of $0.00005916 on November 20, 2024, prior to a pullback of 57.21%. As the meme coin faces a significant drop, Nebula Stride (NST), a new player concentrating on tokenizing real-world assets, is attracting attention as a possible profit generator.\nBONK Price: Market performance BONK price 7-day chart\nDespite recording nearly 17% and 14% in losses, over the past week and month respectively, BONK’s price has experienced substantial growth. Launched on December 25, 2022, under the motto “for the people, by the people,” BONK sought to restore liquidity to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) based on Solana.\nFifty trillion coins, representing half of its total supply, were airdropped to the Solana community, which included NFT creators, developers, and artists, to promote a community-focused ecosystem.\nThis effort not only increased the SOL token’s price by 34% within 48 hours of its launch, but also led to BONK’s trading volume skyrocketing to around $20 million on Orca, a DEX based on Solana.\nSince being listed on major exchanges on December 30, 2022, BONK has witnessed an astounding increase of more than 20,000%. This positrioned it as one of the best meme coins to invest, based on return percentages for 2023.\nIs BONK Price Bullish Reversal on the Horizon?\nDespite this recent downturn, BONK continues to engage its communit. With over 350 onchain integrations, it has recently concluded its “Year of The BONKdragon” event. Rewards from this event will be claimable from February 4th to February 18th, 2025, potentially benefiting all BONK holders.\nMoreover, technical analysis from market observers like @TheEuroSniper suggests a potential price reversal as the top dog-themed meme coin approaches a significant demand zone following a treble drive pattern, hinting at a possible bullish future.\nLooking for this on $BONK 🎯\nTreble drive into weekly demand! pic.twitter.com/iA7iqMHiW9\n— €ｕｒｏＳｎｉｐｅｒ (@TheEuroSniper) January 29, 2025\nNebula Stride (NST): The New Contender In the midst of BONK price fluctuations, another digital currency, Nebula Stride (NST), is attracting investor interest. NST is establishing its presence as one of top RWA tokens, by prioritizing user-friendly infrastructure that links the cryptocurrency domain with tangible economic assets.\nBy facilitating fractional ownership of physical assets, NST expands a multi-trillion-dollar market to a wider audience. This was once available solely to the affluent. This real-world asset (RWA) strategy might result in notable price increases. It might also help increase adoption, establishing NST as a likely front-runner in the sector.\nNebula Strides (NST) Tokenomics\nNST is currently trading at $0.02. Analysts are suggesting high potential returns as the platform expands and the concept of tokenization gains momentum. The token offers a low entry barrier, making it attractive as an early-stage cryptocurrency for both institutional funds and individual investors. It is appealing to those interested in diversifying into tangible assets supported by a comprehensive ecosystem in the RWA sector.\nFinal Thoughts: BONK vs NST as Two Diverging Paths in the Evolving Crypto Market As the crypto market continues to evolve, the contrast between BONK’s community-driven meme coin approach and NST’s focus on real-world asset integration presents two different visions for the future of digital currencies. While BONK price navigates through correction, NST comes in the limelight. NST’s innovative model might indeed make it the next big profit maker in the cryptocurrency landscape. Investors are watching closely as both tokens navigate their respective paths in this dynamic market.\n✓ Share:\nJane Lubale\nWith over four years of experience in the cryptocurrency, Fintech, blockchain, and Web3 industries, I bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise to every piece I write.

    "text": "An experimental liver-growing treatment is facing its biggest test in humans yet. This week, biotech company LyGenesis announced that it has just begun a phase II trial of its therapy designed to grow miniature livers inside a person’s lymph nodes. If the therapy works as hoped, it could potentially save the lives of many people with life-threatening liver disease who are unable to obtain a conventional transplant.\nThe treatment is currently called LYG-LIV-001. It’s derived from donated livers that otherwise wouldn’t be a match for any potential transplant recipient. Certain cells known as hepatocytes are collected from these livers and suspended in a solution. Using a combination of minimally invasive surgery and endoscopic ultrasound, the cells are then transplanted over to the recipient’s upper abdominal lymph nodes. From there, the lymph nodes are expected to act as living “bioreactors,” helping the hepatocytes grow and mature into functional, if ectopic (outside of its usual position in the body), liver tissue.\nLyGenesis is hoping to win approval for LYG-LIV-001 as a treatment for end-stage liver disease , or ESLD, a severe state of chronic organ damage. Though someone can live with ESLD for years, it’s estimated that about 2% of all deaths annually are caused by it. Liver transplantation can be an effective treatment, but many with the condition do not meet the criteria for becoming an organ recipient and about 17% of people on the waiting list for a new liver die annually . On Tuesday, LyGenesis reported that the first ESLD patient of its phase II trial has now received LYG-LIV-001.\n“This therapy will potentially be a remarkable regenerative medicine milestone by helping patients with ESLD grow new functional ectopic livers in their own body,” said LyGenesis CEO Michael Hufford in a statement. If our study is successful and we obtain FDA approval, our allogenic cell therapy could enable one donated liver to treat many dozens of ESLD patients, which could help to tilt the current organ supply-demand imbalance in favor of patients.”\nIt will take months before scientists can know whether the treatment has truly helped this first patient, however. And the trial—set to enroll 12 patients in total—is not expected to be completed until early 2026. But if this research keeps showing promise, then the sky might be the limit. LyGenesis is also developing its bioreactor technology to grow other organs, including the kidneys, thymus, and pancreas.",
