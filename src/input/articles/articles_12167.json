    "title": "In a profound act of love, Indian man cut through a mountain with hammer and chisel for 22 years",
    "text": "A man from Bihar spends 22 years carving through mountains to establish a shorter path between the village and its nearest hospital after his wife's death.\nLove knows no boundaries. It surpasses all human limitations and transforms ordinary individuals [into extraordinary beings](https://scoop.upworthy.com/food-delivery-rider-shows-extraordinary-bravery-by-jumping-off-bridge-to-save-a-woman-from-drowning) who break through impossible barriers. Dashrath Manjhi, fondly called the \"Mountain Man,\" is a prime example of someone who epitomized the profound truth of love through an [incredible act of determination](https://scoop.upworthy.com/20-year-old-redefines-determination-by-cycling-1500-km-from-italy-to-grandparents-house-in-england) for his late wife. While talking to [World Documentary HD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4_ex3ZB7S8), Manjhi revealed how his wife's unfortunate and untimely death turned his life upside down and motivated him to achieve the unbelievable.\nAfter his wife Falguni Devi's heartbreaking demise due to a lack of medical access because of the dangerous mountain, Manjhi embarked on an unbelievable journey. He single-handedly carved a 360-foot-long, 25-foot-wide passage through a rocky mountain to reduce the distance from 75 kilometers to 10 kilometers between his village and the nearest hospital. According to [My Modern Met, ](https://mymodernmet.com/dashrath-manjhi-mountain-man-path-carved/)Manjhi's wife fell from a mountain ridge in Gehlaur, Bihar, India, where the hospital was over 30 miles (approximately 48 km) away. While he saw his wife pass away from serious injuries, he was determined not to let anyone else lose their loved ones due to [inadequate medical assistance](https://scoop.upworthy.com/people-rally-around-doctor-who-refused-to-provide-medical-assistance-on-flight-for-a-valid-reason-ex1). That was how his journey to bring the hospital closer to his village by manually carving a path began.\n\"When I started hammering the hill, people called me a lunatic, but that steeled my resolve. Most villagers taunted me initially, but quite a few lent me support later by giving food and helping me buy my tools,\" Manjhi shared. With just a [hammer and a chisel](https://scoop.upworthy.com/people-cant-believe-granny-mistakenly-used-grenade-as-hammer-to-crack-walnuts-for-20-years), he worked tirelessly to reduce the distance that separated his village from essential services for 22 years. Manjhi's extreme dedication symbolizes the massive human determination that can turn an impossible challenge into a tangible path. \"I was sleeping beside a well. It was 12 in the night and I heard a voice from the sky asking me to break the mountain. Since then, I forgot to sleep. I started thinking about how to break the mountain,\" Manjhi shared with World Documentary HD.\nWith a twinkle in his eyes, Manjhi playfully reflected on his tremendous work and humorously suggested that had his wife been alive, he would have been preoccupied with pleasing her and possibly could not have accomplished such a task. \"If my wife was alive, I would have been busy pleasing her. How could I have done such a mammoth task? No, I am just joking,\" he added. Manjhi's legacy extends far [beyond carving the mountain](https://scoop.upworthy.com/everyones-grandmother-barbara-heralds-the-halloween-season-with-impressive-pumpkin-carving-hack). His determination was once again witnessed when he addressed the unstable river crossing that threatened villagers' lives.\n\"Do you see this river? We cross it every day to reach the market. During monsoons, it gets flooded. Once, I was crossing the river when I slipped and had a close escape from drowning. But that day, I thought how many must have drowned in this river. Then I started making a bridge on this,\" he revealed.\nWith exceptional dedication, Manjhi embarked on yet another astonishing journey, walking 1100 miles along railway lines to secure funding from the Indian government for bridge construction. It is important to note that Manjhi passed away on August 17, 2007, after [battling gallbladder cancer](https://scoop.upworthy.com/anchors-powerful-message-as-she-tearfully-admits-shes-battling-stage-3-breast-cancer-on-air-ex1) for a long time, as reported by [The Viewspaper](https://web.archive.org/web/20090227175828/http://theviewspaper.net/the-mountain-man/). After his demise, the local government built an official road over the path that Manjhi had carved through the mountain. Additionally, Manjhi was honored with a statue and a memorial in his hometown.",

    "text": "Luc Langevin woke up on Thursday morning not knowing what to expect. He fell asleep at 1:30 a.m. at the tail end of Hurricane Milton's peak.\nUnder the cover of darkness, he couldn't see the damage but felt his housing shaking around him.\n\"It's a 2017 house built with the new codes that are supposed to survive a hurricane, but you never know,\" said the Tampa resident.\nBy first light, he was able to survey his neighbourhood. Trees were uprooted, and a neighbour's sun porch was completely ripped off.\nLuckily, he lives in a newer development where the homes were designed to withstand strong winds.\nIn nearby Lakewood Ranch, FL, Daniel Tremblay spent most of his morning on the road.\nHe's a realtor and was out surveying the damage in Sarasota.\nHe shared pictures with CTV News of boats scooped up and dropped into parking lots and debris around the waterfront.\n\"It was so noisy it felt like a freight train,\" he said.\nBy contrast, for about an hour, his house was in the eye of the storm.\n\"I went out with my son and my two dogs. It was total quietness, it was so eerie to experience that.\"\nBoth Langevin and Tremblay count themselves as lucky.\nThere are 10 reported fatalities related to the storm. But the men remained safe with only some damage to their property.\nThey both said the worst part of the experience was the anticipation leading up to the Category 3 storm making landfall.\n\"You don't really know exactly where the storm will hit but you can see it getting bigger and bigger,\" said Langevin.\n\"The anticipation is the worst. It's a feeling of dread,\" added Tremblay.\nBoth said their communities have come together to help in the aftermath.\nLangevin was without power Thursday morning and stored his frozen food in a neighbour's freezer.\nTremblay was relaying messages to those who were under evacuation orders to give them updates on their property, as they now wait for the all-clear to come back and start the clean up.",

Además, los trenes han dejado de efectuar parada en la Estación del Arte, en la línea 1 sentido Pinar de Chamartín, también por la entrada de agua a los andenes.\nUn chaparroncillo, nada...... Pacífico, Madrid.— Jose4Fun (@FunJose4)\n[pic.twitter.com/Xmumdwppdj] [August 2, 2024]\nEl servicio de Cercanías también ha sufrido problemas. En concreto, la incidencia ha afectado desde las 15:15 horas a las líneas C-3 (Aranjuez-Chamartín) y C-4 (Parla-Colmenar Viejo), en ambos sentidos. La presencia de agua en las instalaciones estaba provocando demoras medidas de unos 12 minutos en ambas líneas, aunque no ha impedido la circulación de trenes.\nLas incidencias han comenzado sobre las 15 horas después de la breve pero intensa tromba de agua que ha caído en la capital. La situación en las carreteras, no obstante, no se ha visto especialmente afectada. La DGT ha informado que después de las 15.30 horas, los problemas circulatorios se concentraban a la salida de la capital por la A-42, a su paso por Getafe, debido a un alcance.\nTambién había tráfico lento en las salidas de Madrid por la A-1, a su paso por La Cabrera; en la A-2, a la altura de Torrejón de Ardoz y Rivas; y en la A-5, a la altura de Arroyomolinos. De la misma manera, se registraban complicaciones circulatorias en la M-40, cortada en sentido A-3, en la zona de Mercamadrid, en dirección a la A-4, han apuntado las mismas fuentes.",

    "text": "Dan Campbell has seemingly settled in pretty well since taking over as the coach of the Lions, but he’s been forced to relocate due to some fans who’ve been unable to respect his privacy.\nBeing a head coach in the NFL is a job that obviously comes with plenty of perks, but there are also more than a few downsides that tend to rear their ugly head when you’re in that particular line of work.\nWhile I can’t speak from personal experience, I can imagine the paycheck that accompanies that gig makes it a bit easier to tolerate the stress you have to deal with; Browns skipper Kevin Stefanski is reportedly the lowest-paid coach in the league but still makes $3.5 million a year, so it’s safe to say he and the rest of his colleagues are able to live pretty comfortably.\nThat group includes\nDan Campbell, who was making an estimated $4 million a year before he signed a contract extension with the Detroit Lions earlier this year that runs until 2027 (the team declined to release specific details concerning the financials, but you have to imagine it came with a pay bump based on the turnaround he’s staged since arriving in 2021).\nOne of the aforementioned downsides of being a high-profile sports figure is that there’s only so much you can do to protect your privacy, which is why many members of that group tend to reside in gated communities or exclusive apartment complexes; even if you try to keep the location of your home under wraps, it tends to turn into an open secret in the area.\nAccording to Crain’s Detroit, Campbell learned that lesson the hard way after purchasing a house in the Motor City suburb of Bloomfield Hills that was previously owned by longtime Red Wings center Igor Larionov, as he said he decided to put it on the market for $4.5 million thanks to a tiny group of Lions diehards who occasionally showed up to the property to voice their discontent:\n“The neighborhood, everything. There’s plenty of space, it’s on two acres, the home is beautiful. It’s just that people figured out where we lived when we lost.”\nSome people take sports way too seriously.",
