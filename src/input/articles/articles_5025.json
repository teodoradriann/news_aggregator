    "text": "New research suggests that despite widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in marketing, nearly half of these initiatives are failing to deliver expected business value. The Infosys CMO Radar 2024 report highlights that although 73% of enterprises have integrated AI technologies, only 52% are achieving the desired business outcomes. This discrepancy underscores a significant challenge in effectively harnessing AI's potential within marketing strategies.\nAI-fluency amongst Chief Marketing Officers (CMOs) is correlated with improved business outcomes. The report indicates that 62% of AI-fluent CMOs anticipate increased influence across corporate decision-making processes as they exploit AI tools to boost personalisation, optimise marketing campaigns, and enhance efficiency.\nHowever, CMOs continue to face obstacles in fully aligning AI strategies with wider business objectives and processes. The Infosys report categorises CMOs into three groups based on their AI fluency: Leaders (13%), Learners (60%), and Laggards (27%). This categorisation is based on their ability to derive business value from AI across varied marketing activities.\nThe research outlines four primary tactics that AI-fluent CMOs employ to generate business value from AI: embedding AI into business processes, aligning AI with broader business strategies, integrating risk management in AI-powered marketing solutions, and ensuring that MarTech infrastructures are scalable for AI applications.\nSatish H C, Executive Vice President and Chief Delivery Officer at Infosys, commented, \"Very early on, at Infosys, we saw how AI promises to disrupt the way B2B and B2C players think about customer experience, marketing productivity, and growth. The findings of the Infosys CMO Radar 2024 report point to how forward-thinking marketing leaders are adjusting to this new landscape.\n\"Central to this transformation is the reimagining of marketing end to end, embracing a holistic approach to innovation. By focusing on disintermediation for agility, businesses can swiftly adapt to changes and enhance their competitive edge.\n\"The report underscores the vital role of leadership in harnessing AI capabilities to drive marketing innovation and customer engagement. With Infosys Aster, we are already bringing the digital capabilities for marketing leaders to maximise operations, while taking advantage of advances in marketing effectiveness and personalisation in an AI-first future.\"\nSumit Virmani, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Marketing Officer at Infosys, added, \"CMOs face the dual challenge of fueling growth in the short-term while articulating the value of their brand investments in the medium term. They recognise AI's, especially generative AI's, potential to help them rewire marketing for greater effectiveness.\n\"They know it can also be a key amplifier of marketing impact to the business and its influence within the C-Suite. The Infosys CMO Radar 2024 unpacks the tactics that CMOs can embrace to get and stay ahead in these times of AI-powered transformation.\"\nThe research was conducted through an anonymous survey involving 2,600 marketing executives from various sectors including automotive, financial services, and healthcare across multiple regions such as Australia, Germany, the Nordics, the UK, and the US. It examined AI adoption across the marketing lifecycle, focusing on activities such as content creation, campaign management, and analytics.\nThe findings underscore the critical need for companies to not only adopt AI but to strategically align AI initiatives with overarching business goals to realise substantial business value.",

    "text": "LONDON/SEOUL (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines, British Airways and Lufthansa have increased their flights over Afghanistan after years of largely avoiding it now the Middle East conflict has made it seem a relatively safe option.\nThe carriers mostly stopped transiting Afghanistan, which lies on major routes between Asia and Europe, three years ago when the Taliban took over and air traffic control services stopped.\nThose services have yet to resume, but airlines increasingly consider the skies between Iran and Israel are riskier than Afghan airspace. Many had started routing through Iran and the Middle East after Russian skies were closed to most western carriers when the Ukraine war began in 2022.\n\"As conflicts have evolved, the calculus of which airspace to use has changed. Airlines are seeking to mitigate risk as much as possible and they see overflying Afghanistan as the safer option given the current tensions between Iran and Israel,\" Ian Petchenik, a spokesperson for flight tracking organisation Flightradar24, said.\nThere were more than seven times the number of flights over Afghanistan in the second week of August than during the same period a year ago, according to a Reuters analysis of FlightRadar24 data.\nThe shift began in mid-April during reciprocal missile and drone attacks between Iran and Israel. Flight tracking data from the time shows Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, British Airways and others began to send a few flights a day over Afghanistan.\nBut the main growth has been since the killing of senior members of militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah in late July raised concerns of a major escalation.\nSome pilots are concerned.\n\"You're depending on the analysis of your airline. Every time I fly out there, I don't like the feeling of flying over a conflict area where you don't know, actually, what is happening,\" said Otjan de Bruin, a commercial pilot and head of the European Cockpit Association.\n\"It's always safe enough, until proven otherwise.\"\nLufthansa Group told Reuters it decided to resume overflying Afghan airspace from early July.\nOther carriers that have increased overflights since April include Turkish Airlines, Thai Airways and the Air France-KLM group, data shows.\n\"Based on actual security information, KLM and other airlines currently safely overfly Afghanistan only on specific routes and only at high altitudes,\" KLM told Reuters.\nBritish Airways, Thai Airways, Turkish Airlines and Singapore Airlines did not respond to requests for comment.\nTaiwan's EVA Air began from late July, flight tracking data shows. EVA told Reuters it chooses routes based on safety, the current international situation and flight advisories.\nREGULATION'S ROLE\nThe route changes have been facilitated by aviation regulators easing guidance on Afghanistan.\nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in early July said planes could fly at a lower altitude over a sliver of north-eastern Afghanistan, the Wakhan Corridor, which is used to cross from Tajikistan to Pakistan - opening that path to more types of flights.\nA year earlier, the FAA lifted its ban on overflights for the entire country, but said planes must stay above 32,000 feet (9,753.6 m) where surface-to-air weapons are considered less effective.\nBut few started using Afghanistan until April.\nAlthough more traffic has been using the airspace without incident, there is no guarantee of crew or passenger safety if a plane has to land, flight safety group OPSGROUP said in July.\nIn the absence of air traffic control, pilots crossing Afghanistan talk to nearby planes over radio according to a protocol drawn up by U.N. aviation body ICAO and Afghanistan's Civil Aviation Authority.\nEuropean aviation safety regulator EASA said in a conflict-zone information bulletin re-issued in July that \"extremist non-state actor groups remain active and might sporadically target aviation facilities in multiple ways.\"\nThe industry is haunted by the memory of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, which was shot down over eastern Ukraine in 2014, as fighting raged between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces.\nCOST AND LIMITED CHOICE\nAirlines are under pressure to save money after the loss since 2022 of many shorter paths through Russian airspace, and as they re-build from the pandemic.\nThere are few international rules that dictate which areas of airspace are safe and airline safety decisions are left largely to the discretion of individual carriers.\nIf an airline cannot fly through Russia, Ukraine or Iran, central Afghanistan offers a more direct route into southern Asia from Europe.\n\"This route saved us a fair chunk of time and fuel,\" OPSGROUP reported from a pilot in July who flew from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur across central Afghanistan.\n(Reporting by Joanna Plucinska in London and Lisa Barrington in Seoul; Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard in Taipei; Editing by Barbara Lewis)\nBy Joanna Plucinska and Lisa Barrington\nShare © Reuters - 2024",

    "text": "Telephone takes a leap with its full entry into the cryptocurrency business. The telecom has announced a new virtual wallet from Bit2Me for the management of cryptocurrencies. He has thus presented the application Your Wallet which serves “to manage crypto assets in a simple and transparent way.”\n«This cryptocurrency wallet allows users to buy, sell, send and pay with a selection of cryptocurrencies that have the highest business volume in the market. The service is operated entirely by Bit2Me the first Spanish exchange registered with the Bank of Spain,” the company has indicated.\nLikewise, this is Telefónica’s first big move to bring the crypto world closer to consumers, but before they had already taken a small step in this segment. Precisely, they are shareholders of Bit2Me, the operator with which they are now partnering to launch this wallet.\nTelefónica adds that the ‘app’ “offers an accessible, secure and simple experience. It is now available for Android and iOS and to operate it will only be necessary to download the application and register with an email address and a mobile phone number. The service is aimed at any customer with a Spanish mobile number regardless of the operator of which they are a customer. The company has clarified that it will not be necessary to be a Telefónica customer but that the virtual wallet is open to the public.\nLikewise, the application gives the user a virtual card in collaboration with Mastercard with which the consumer can make payments with the cryptocurrencies they have stored. At the time of making the transaction, the ‘app’ itself converts the cryptocurrency to be able to pay the equivalent in euros.\n“Your Wallet is thus incorporated into the catalog of services and solutions of tu.com, Telefónica Innovación Digital’s commercial platform to offer the company’s most cutting-edge technological products and services,” Telefónica reported. Chema Alonso, chief digital officer of Telefónica and CEO of Telefónica Innovación Digital, stated during the presentation: «Tu.com is the platform that allows us to innovate in over-the-top digital products and services and bring them to the market quickly. It is, in reality, an incubator for innovation projects that allows us to be more disruptive and test new products that we market directly throughout the world and that we can eventually integrate into the offering of our commercial brands in the countries where Telefónica operates.\n#Telefónica #fully #enters #crypto #business #launches #virtual #wallet",

A lesão ocorreu na final do torneio. A expectativa é que o jogador de 21 anos volte a ficar à disposição apenas no final da temporada.\nHugo ganhou vários elogios do técnico Luis Zubeldía. O jogador estava em uma lista de atletas que subiriam para o time principal após o término da competição. O volante chegou a atuar em uma partida do Campeonato Paulista, na estreia contra o Botafogo-SP. Na ocasião, vários jogadores ainda estavam na pré-temporada nos Estados Unidos.\nO jogador chegou ao São Paulo por empréstimo do SKA Brasil, até o final de janeiro. Porém com o destaque do atleta e conquista do título, o São Paulo já adquiriu Hugo pelo valor de R$ 400 mil, por 80% dos direitos econômicos do volante.\nSiga nosso conteúdo nas redes sociais: Bluesky, Threads, Twitter, Instagram e Facebook.",

    "text": "[newsBot](/members/newsbot.9529/) Automated News Bot Staff member The suspect is identified as Rafee Al-Mansur, 33, of Waldorf, Maryland. Al-Mansur is charged with two counts of sexual solicitation of a minor. He was transported to the Anne Arundel County Detention Center. Beginning in April 2024, members of the Maryland Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force developed evidence of sexual solicitation of a minor in an online chat. An investigation led to the identification of a suspect, who believed he was communicating with a 13-year-old girl in an online chat. Investigators from the Maryland State Police Computer Crimes Unit with assistance from Homeland Security Investigations served a search warrant at the suspect’s residence in Charles County. Al-Mansur was arrested at the scene. The Maryland State Police Computer Crimes Unit coordinates the Maryland Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. This is a combined law enforcement effort involving police departments across Maryland that is made possible in part due to grant funds provided by the Governor’s Office for Crime Prevention and Policy and by a federal grant from the U.S. Department of Justice. Task force investigators focus on identifying those involved in child pornography via the Internet and other related crimes that victimize children. The investigation continues.
