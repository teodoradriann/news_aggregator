    "title": "Katie Price arrested at Heathrow Airport and to appear in court tomorrow - LBC",
    "text": "[ Clive Bull ](/radio/presenters/clive-bull/) 1am - 4am Katie Price arrested at Heathrow Airport and due to appear in court today 8 August 2024, 22:12 | Updated: 9 August 2024, 05:39 TV personality and former glamour model Katie Price has been arrested at Heathrow Airport following her return to the UK from Turkey. Listen to this article Loading audio... A warrant for the 46-year-old's arrest had been issued last month after she failed to attend court last week for a hearing relating to her bankruptcies. Price remains in custody and is due to appear in court on Friday, police authorities confirmed. On Thursday, the mum-of-five shared a statement on Instagram, saying she had been visiting Turkey to film a documentary. She revealed that when returning from work she would be \"detained at the airport\" as the \"courts feel is necessary\". When speaking about her 22-year-old son Harvey, who accompanied her to Turkey, she requested that they \"allow some dignity and protection for at least his sake as this will be extremely disturbing for him to see\". When acknowledging the \"severity\" of the matter, Price added she was being treated \"like a criminal\" and said the \"unfortunate financial circumstance\" did not mean she was a \"criminal or bad person\".

She went on to add that she would be paying off her debts, and wished that for \"Harvey's sake it's handled with care and compassion.\"It comes after she was told to pay £25,000 after being declared bankrupt two times. A judge at a previous hearing said Price risked being arrested if she did not go to further court dates, saying that evidence would be needed if she was not present. When issuing her arrest warrant, Judge Burton said she had \"failed to attend today's hearing\" and had provided no explanation for her absence. She said: \"It is in my judgment necessary that the court issue a warrant for Ms Price's arrest.\"She has no real excuse in failing to attend today's hearing.\" She continued: \"The reason for her absence today is irrelevant.\"Judge Burton said the arrest warrant was not issued \"lightly\" but Price had given only \"piecemeal co-operation\" and did not provide the \"most basic information\" regarding her bankruptcies. Beforehand, she was given an eviction notice that told her to leave her Mucky Mansion by the end of May, and went on to move into a Tudor-style property costing £5,000 per month. In March, she was declared bankrupt a second time due to an unpaid tax bill of £761,994.05, after initially being declared bankrupt in 2019. But at the end of July she insisted \"everything is sorted\" regarding her second bankruptcy having been evicted from her Sussex home. She jetted off to Turkey on 29 July, and shared a photo of herself on the plane just a few hours before her court hearing the following day. In Turkey she had her sixth face lift, which cost £10,000.It's thought she had the face lift at the Trio Clinic in Istanbul, with work done on her eyes and under her chin. She also underwent another dental procedure, and shared photos of new veneers on Wednesday. On Instagram, she posted snaps of her new dental work, wearing sunglasses with the name of the dental surgery 'Dentica' on. In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said: \"A 46-year-old woman from Surrey was arrested at Heathrow Airport at 19:45hrs on Thursday, 8 August for failing to appear at court. \"She has been remanded in custody at a west London police station to appear at the Royal Courts of Justice tomorrow, Friday, 9 August.\"",

The store manager at the Circle K at 3431 Southern Trace at Southern Trace Plaza was conducting an inventory on Wednesday morning and discovered that the store was $150 short on revenue from Florida Lottery tickets, according to an arrest report from the Sumter County Sheriff’s Office. The manager checked the in-store surveillance that showed the night shift employee, 41-year-old Vairley Ann Nickerson of The Villages, taking $170 worth of scratch-off tickets. She concealed the tickets in a garbage bag as she cleaned. At the end of her shift she cashed out a single $20 winning ticket. Nickerson was taken into custody when she showed up for the night shift on Wednesday. At the time of her arrest, she was found to be in possession of methamphetamine. She was taken into custody and booked on charges of theft and drug possession at the Sumter County Detention Center. Bond was set at $2,500.",

    "text": "It’s a little hard to believe we’ve gone through most of 2024 without a new Amazon Fire TV Stick. That is, until now. The Fire TV Stick HD has been announced, with the $35 device reducing the Fire TV Stick lineup from four to three and in the process replacing the two oldest sticks in the family. The $40 Fire TV Stick and the $30 Fire TV Stick Lite will still be around while they’re in stock. But after that, they’re gone.\nThe other two current devices remain the second-generation Fire TV Stick 4K , and the second-gen Fire TV Stick 4K Max , which we still consider to be the best Fire TV Stick to get .\nRecommended Videos There’s not a ton to write home about here. The Fire TV Stick HD, as the name implies, tops out at 1080p. It does support HDR , HDR 10, HDR10+, and HLG , but there’s no Dolby Vision , or Dolby Atmos for audio, for that matter. (It does support HDMI passthrough of Dolby-encoded audio, though.) It comes with the basic Alexa Voice remote, uses the older Wi-Fi 5 (that’s 802.11ac) standard, and has just 8GB of storage for apps and movies or whatever, along with 1GB of RAM . It’ll work with Amazon’s Luna cloud gaming service, but not Xbox Game Pass.\nRelated JBL wants you to ditch your soundbar for its affordable new home theater lineup LG rolls out its gamer-friendly M4 wireless OLED TV Nit Nerds News: Exciting new Apple TV 4K features, new Xbox consoles And it’s still using Micro USB for power. In 2024.\nIt’s also lacking other Fire TV OS features like the Ambient Experience , which allows for AI-generated artwork, and you won’t even get picture-in-picture support on this stick.\nSo this stick’s as much about Amazon consolidating things at the low end as it is anything else. Good for a spare room, perhaps, but probably not for your living room.\nEditors’ Recommendations Hisense prices its 65-inch CanvasTV way less than The Frame Apple TV’s InSight feature is ready to take on Amazon Prime Video’s X-Ray Game Pass is coming to your Amazon Fire TV, even if you don’t own an Xbox Apple apes a major Amazon Prime Video feature in tvOS 18 Samsung adds new sizes to its microLED TV lineup — and they start at $110K",

Or, ce n’était pas le cas du capitaine et des six membres d’équipage de l’«Elite Navigator», qui a coulé à environ 240 km des côtes aux premières heures du 18 juillet 2024, indique le rapport.\n«Le bateau transportait plus d’équipement de sécurité que ne l’exigeait la réglementation, et le capitaine et les membres d’équipage avaient pour pratique de discuter des scénarios et des interventions en cas d’urgence», lit-on dans le rapport du BST. «Pendant l’événement, ils ont aussi démontré des concepts issus de la formation sur la sécurité, en particulier leur utilisation de l’équipement de sauvetage.»\nUne alarme s’est déclenchée sur le bateau le 17 juillet 2024, quelques instants après que le capitaine eut communiqué par radio avec la côte pour annoncer qu’ils rentraient chez eux après une sortie de pêche au turbot. Le capitaine a remarqué de la fumée provenant de la salle des machines et un autre membre d’équipage a vu des flammes dans les conduits d’échappement, qui contenaient les tuyaux d’échappement du moteur principal et du générateur, selon le rapport.\nComme le bateau a ensuite coulé, les enquêteurs n’ont pas pu déterminer la cause de l’incendie. L’équipage n’avait aucun moyen de fermer rapidement la salle des machines et de déployer un système d’extinction d’incendie au dioxyde de carbone (CO2), mais ce système n’était pas exigé par la réglementation et son utilisation n’était donc soumise à aucune règle, ont indiqué les enquêteurs.\n«Si les bateaux de pêche sont équipés de systèmes au CO2, il est important que ces systèmes soient conçus de manière optimale pour les situations d’urgence, précise le BST. Par exemple, la ventilation de la salle des machines doit pouvoir être scellée rapidement.»\nLes tentatives de lutte contre les flammes ayant échoué, un membre d’équipage a saisi cinq combinaisons d’immersion – tout ce qu’il pouvait transporter – et les a remises à ses compagnons. Deux autres hommes ont été piégés par les flammes à l’avant du bateau, selon le rapport.\nLe capitaine a lancé des appels de détresse à l’aide du radiotéléphone VHF et du dispositif d’appel sélectif numérique VHF du bateau, mais le rapport indique que le navire était tellement loin au large qu’il était impossible que les signaux parviennent directement aux autorités des Services de communications et de trafic maritimes.\nCependant, le rapport indique qu’un radiotéléphone à moyenne fréquence, disponible à bord du bateau mais non utilisé, a une portée plus longue et aurait pu transmettre les appels de détresse avec succès.\n«Voilà pourquoi il est important que les marins connaissent les capacités des divers dispositifs d’alerte de détresse afin de pouvoir utiliser le dispositif qui convient le mieux au scénario donné», souligne le BST.\nLes cinq hommes en combinaison ont sauté dans l’eau glaciale, où les vagues atteignaient trois mètres de hauteur. Deux d’entre eux ont nagé jusqu’aux membres d’équipage bloqués à l’avant et les ont aidés à descendre du bateau et à monter dans les radeaux de sauvetage.\nIls dérivaient dans le radeau depuis plus de 50 heures lorsqu’ils ont aperçu un hélicoptère et des lumières provenant d’un bateau voisin et ont déclenché leur dernière fusée éclairante, selon le rapport. L’hélicoptère a perçu le signal et la Garde côtière canadienne les a secourus peu après.",

    "text": "00:08 PLACER COUNTY, Calif. – While hundreds of cases of beer on ice may sound like a dream, it was a nightmare for one truck driver who lost a load of beer on an icy mountain interstate Monday.\n\"Don&apos;t get any ideas,\" wrote the California Highway Patrol on social media after the crash Monday morning . \"This scene will be cleaned up.\"\nThe CHP had to close three miles of westbound I-80 and reroute traffic for over an hour to clean up a beer spill. The truck hit an icy patch and overturned, spilling Coors Light across the highway and snow in the California mountains.\nThe Golden State saw a very late-season snow storm over the weekend. The nearby Central Sierra Snow Lab got 26.4 inches of snow on May 5, which made the spring day the snowiest of the entire \"winter\" season.\nHOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER\n\"Apparently the mountains aren’t turning blue, but the cans are,\" joked the CHP referring to the mountains on the beer can turning blue when cold. \"Icy roads didn’t stop this driver from popping the top and emptying more than a few.\"\nUnfortunately for the driver, the beer featuring the Rocky Mountains now chilled out on the Sierra Nevada.\nThe driver and passenger were treated for minor injuries at a hospital and released, according to local media.\nThe CHP had another unusual clean up just a week earlier. This one a stickier situation near Fresno . Early on May 1, one truck hit another delivering several honey bee boxes.\nWATCH: BEES SWARM NEW YORK&apos;S TIMES SQUARE\nnext Image 1 of 4\nprev next Image 2 of 4\nprev next Image 3 of 4\nprev Image 4 of 4 \"Un-BEE-lievable scene overnight as a truck carrying a shipment of BEE boxes was struck, scattering thousands of buzzing bees and their homes all over the highway near Selma,\" the CHP posted. \"Our officers were stuck in a sticky situation for almost an hour with thousands of swarming worker bees.\"\nThe bee boxes smashed open across the highway. Upset worker bees buzzed around human workers for over an hour as officers loaded the bees onto another truck.\nThe CHP told local media that thousands of bees were saved. This driver did not have weather to blame.\nTags Transportation Winter Weather California",

    "title": "The Future of Athletic Training at UHS",
    "text": "The Athletic Students Training Program at University High School (UHS), initiated by head athletic trainer Julia Cendejas, is providing students interested in sports medicine with invaluable hands-on experience. Launched last year with just two students, participation has surged to about ten, with expectations of further growth as interest in the program increases. Students learn essential skills including basic anatomy, injury treatment, rehabilitation protocols, and practical applications like taping and ice bag preparation. The program stands out for its flexible, self-driven participation model, allowing students to coordinate their training around their schedules. By the Numbers- Program began with 2 students in the previous year. - Current enrollment is about 10 students, with expectations for growth. - The program operates without a fixed meeting schedule or membership requirements. - Students interested in participating independently express their interest and coordinate with the trainer. As interest grows, Cendejas hopes to expand the program further, potentially leading to the establishment of a comprehensive sports medicine curriculum at UHS. With additional student involvement, there may be enhanced athletic training support for UHS teams. Bottom LineThe establishment of the Athletic Students Training Program at UHS not only equips students with hands-on experience in sports medicine but also lays the groundwork for a more robust athletic training program, advocating the importance of this field in high school athletics.
