    "text": "Tele2 Sweden reported a sharp increase in SMS fraud attempts on customers during October, taking the total number of scam messages blocked by the operator to more than 18 million so far in 2024.\nIn October, the number of messages blocked by the operator was up 40 per cent compared with September, with an anticipation this would increase again around retail event Black Friday and in the run-up to Christmas, given historic data.\nA current theme identified was for scams claiming the recipient had made purchases at electronics retailers.\nIn a statement, Tele2 head of security Jonas Lindstrom noted: “Organised crime sees this type of fraud as relatively risk free and we see an increase in hoax text messages every year. We have also seen that, with the help of AI, people become more efficient and sophisticated in their fraud”.\nAI has been cited by Europol as helping criminals streamline fraud, Tele2 highlighted, causing issues for firewalls and making scams appear more convincing.\nLindstrom added the operator was using “information and technical solutions” in its battle to protect users. Among these initiatives is its use of AI to automatically identify patterns and threats, and block suspicious activity.",

    "title": "Nitish in Delhi amid ‘joining NDA’ talks",
    "text": "Bihar deputy chief minister and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has rubbished the rumours about the resignation of Lalan Singh New Delhi: Top leaders of the Janata Dal (United) are in New Delhi for the party’s national executive meeting on Friday. The two-day meeting was convened by JD(U) president Rajiv Ranjan Singh, popularly known as Lalan Singh, amid speculation that he could step down to make way for Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar to take over the reins of the party again. The JD(U)’s national office-bearers' meeting was held Thursday and this will be followed by national executive and national council meetings on Friday. However, Lalan Singh dismissed reports of his resignation, saying a “narrative” has been set by the media at the behest of the ruling BJP. Mr Singh said the meeting was a routine one, and stressed that his party remains united. “If I have to resign, I will call you (the media), and consult you about what to write in the resignation letter, so that you can go to the BJP office and get the draft. You are trying to set the narrative… JD(U) is one, and will remain united,” Mr Singh said. Speculation has been rife that Mr Singh may be asked to resign due to his alleged proximity to ally Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). A section of the media also claimed that after having dumped the BJP in August last year, Mr Kumar was now planning an about-turn. Mr Nitish Kumar asserted that the party’s meeting was a “normal and annual” affair with “nothing extraordinary” about it, rejecting speculation about turmoil in his party. He, however, ducked questions when asked whether Lalan Singh was likely to make a formal offer of his resignation at the meeting on December 29. He also evaded questions about the rumours of his joining the NDA. Bihar deputy chief minister and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has rubbished the rumours about the resignation of Lalan Singh. “These is all useless talk… Every party holds its national executive meeting. We also held our party’s national executive meeting in Delhi,” Mr Yadav said. At the national executive meeting venue, posters featuring Bihar CM Nitish Kumar reading “Pradesh ne pehchana, ab desh bhi pehchanega” (The state of Bihar recognised him, now the nation will) were put up. However, as the Lok Sabha elections draw closer, the BJP claims that a transfer of power in Bihar is in the offing, a claim strongly denied by the ruling coalition. Union minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh said: “Nitish Kumar ji will remain the chief minister of Bihar for just a few days. Lalu Prasad Yadav has created a ‘chakravyuh’ for this. The first step of this ‘chakravyuh’ was making Awadh Bihar the Speaker of the Bihar Assembly. Nitish Kumar will become former (CM) very soon… It is fixed that Nitish Kumar will not remain the CM anymore. In the next few days, Bihar is going to get a CM from the RJD…”",

In the lawsuit, [Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.tipranks.com/news/meta-platforms-ditches-controversial-fact-checkers-in-favor-of-x-inspired-community-notes) is accused of approving the use of pirated versions of copyrighted works to train the company’s [AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) systems.\nThe plaintiffs who are suing [Meta Platforms ](https://www.tipranks.com/news/article/amazon-and-meta-wolfe-chooses-the-best-internet-stocks-to-buy)claim that internal documents produced by the social media giant show that the company knew the works being used with its AI products were pirated and violated copyright laws.\nIntellectual Property\nA growing number of individuals such as Ms. Silverman and organizations such as The New York Times Co. [(NYT)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nyt) are suing tech companies over the unauthorized use of their copyrighted content to train AI models and applications.\nIn the case of [Meta Platforms](https://www.tipranks.com/news/meta-platforms-meta-switches-global-affairs-president-ahead-of-trump-inauguration), the authors involved argue that the company misused their books and other content to train its large language model called “Llama.” For their part, Meta and other defendants have argued that they made fair use of copyrighted materials.\nSo far, the legal actions have produced mixed results.

    "text": "By Holly Taylor ,\n6 hours ago Raequan Outlaw likes helping people. Sometimes that comes in the form of being a first responder, and sometimes it’s simply sharing knowledge and experiences with someone who needs it.\nNorthampton County native Raequan Outlaw currently works full time as a paramedic in Dare County while also serving in an officer’s role with the Woodland Volunteer Fire Department. Contributed Photo\nOutlaw is a Northampton County native who grew up in Conway. He recalled attending school at Willis Hare Elementary and Conway Middle School. When he got to high school, he transferred to the Roanoke Valley Early College, since Northampton’s district didn’t offer that kind of early college program at the time.\nHe was able to get his EMT certification through Roanoke Chowan Community College at the age of 17, and then his paramedic certification just two years later. Currently, he works full-time as a paramedic for Dare County EMS.\n“My job is to provide quality pre-hospital care to everybody in need,” he explained.\nOutlaw said many people see an ambulance and think merely of the transportation side of the job as the vehicle carries patients from one place to another. But inside, Outlaw and his coworkers stay busy treating their patients while in motion, doing everything from providing medications to performing small surgical procedures.\nOver the years, he’s learned how to handle all sorts of emergencies and utilize teamwork to get the job done.\n“If it was meant for only one person to do, they’d only send one person in the ambulance,” he explained.\nOutlaw also has two years of experience as a medical examiner, previously serving in the position a few years ago for Northampton, Hertford, and Halifax counties.\n“That was quite a rewarding experience,” he recalled. “I’ve got to say it was definitely one of the most challenging jobs I’ve ever done. It was a whole new realm of investigations.”\nIn that position, Outlaw worked to find out the cause of death through physical examinations and other tests, such as drawing blood for toxicology. He had to handle all kinds of deaths, including accidental ones, overdoses, suicides, and homicides.\n“It’s quite a bit of work. Definitely a lot of paperwork involved,” he added, noting that his line of work means he has to pay close attention to details.\nThat particular skill for detail is one that he first started developing at age 16 when he began volunteering with the Woodland Volunteer Fire Department, where he is now a lieutenant. He credited Woodland VFD Chief Chris Collier with being instrumental in showing him how to settle into the role of a first responder.\n“He was a huge role model for me when I first got to the fire department. He taught me the importance of being very thorough and methodical with a lot of things you do,” Outlaw explained.\nThe fire department experience has taught him how to be prepared for anything, and Outlaw said it’s opened the doors for all the other opportunities in his career.\nOutside of work, Outlaw enjoys spending time with his family, enjoying the outdoors, and traveling. But one of his favorite things is playing music.\n“I play with an excellent group of guys. It’s not anything about money when we get together. It’s just the collaboration of our talents, coming together for the sole purpose of making a good sound,” he said.\nThe group has played at some local restaurants, including Latin Soul in Murfreesboro. And their sound is a variety of several genres, just depending on what they want to play.\nOutlaw has played piano since he was 13, and can also play guitar as well. He said he enjoys pretty much any kind of music, ranging from gospel and classical to country, rock, and R&B. Unable to read sheet music, Outlaw plays everything by ear, and has fun when people challenge him to play a new song.\nHe said learning how to listen and appreciate music is like learning a whole other language.\nGrowing up in Northampton County, Outlaw said he was raised in a loving community, and he’s glad to see there are more opportunities available for people these days. But he wants to make sure those people know that those opportunities are actually out there.\n“They don’t know they can join their local fire department. They don’t know they can get their EMT training paid for from the local fire department because of continuing education,” he said, listing a few examples.\n“I’m not one to withhold knowledge,” he continued. “If I know something, you’ll know it too. You don’t want people to make the same mistakes you made. That’s part of growing. You don’t want to see people fail.”\nOutlaw said he believed that people go through tough times so that they can pass on their knowledge and experience later to others going through the same things.\nAs for the future, Outlaw already has a five-year plan in place to become a CRNA (certified registered nurse anesthetist).\nHe is currently taking nursing classes, which are set to finish next year. Then he plans to get his masters degree in nursing, and then attend East Carolina University for their CRNA program. Outlaw is looking forward to how much he will learn as he continues his education.\n“Everything that’s worth having has got to come with a little hard work,” he explained.\nSharing a bit of advice, Outlaw encouraged people to not be afraid to step out of their “comfort zone.” Because you never know… the opportunity might lead you to a more comfortable place than you were in before.\nThe post Black History Month Salute! appeared first on The Roanoke-Chowan News-Herald .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
