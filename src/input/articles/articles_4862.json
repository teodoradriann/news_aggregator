    "text": "Monsignor Susitino Sionepoe, from Wallis-and Futuna, was officially installed on Saturday as the new Archbishop of Nouméa, Wallis-and-Futuna, and Vanuatu.\nHe is the first Pacific Islander to access this key position, which had been held by 81-year-old Monsignor Michel-Marie Calvet since 1981.\nMonsignor Sionepoe's inaugural mass was held in the Saint Joseph Cathedral of Nouméa, in presence of thousands of Catholics, some of them coming from as far as New Zealand, where Wellington-based Mgr Gábor Pinter, the Nuncio of the Vatican, is based for the whole region.\nEleven bishops from the region, including Guam, Papeete, Port Vila, Kiribati and Wallis-et-Futuna, were also in attendance.\nOfficials from New Caledonia also included French High Commissioner Louis Le Franc, Senator Georges Naturel, Congress President Veylma Falaeo, Southern Province President Sonia Backès, the mayors of Nouméa Mayor (Sonia Lagarde), Mont-Dore (Eddie Lecourieux) and Dumbéa (Yoann Lecourieux) and pro-independence leader Roch Wamytan.\nDuring his inaugural homily, the new archbishop appealed to all Catholics, especially in New Caledonia, to remain \"artisan of peace\".\nCatholicism is a major religious denomination in New Caledonia, with a 182-year history in the French Pacific territory.\nIn the weeks following destructive riots that broke out on 13 May 2024, several Catholic missions throughout New Caledonia were targeted by arson and largely destroyed.\nAs he was officially and liturgically intronised and ushered into the Cathedral, 60-year-old Mgr Sionepoe, who was elevated to the position by Pope Francis on 15 January 2025, was surrounded by conches and drums from Lifou Island, as well as traditional singing and dancing from his native islands of Wallis-et-Futuna.\nThe ceremony was also attended by over six hundred Catholics outside the Cathedral on a giant screen.\nBack in Wallis-and-Futuna, the live broadcast was followed by thousands.\nMonsignor Sionepoe, from Wallis-and-Futuna, was ordained priest in 1993 and became Bishop of Wallis in 1998.\nDuring his career, he has also served in Tonga, in the North of New Caledonia and Fiji.",

    "text": "Applied Health Sciences master’s student Shamae Quinquito (BSc ’23) is one of 20 recipients of Brock’s 2023-24 Horizon Graduate Student Scholarship.\nNOTE: This is one in a series of articles on Brock’s 2023-24 Horizon Graduate Student Scholarship recipients. Read other stories in the series on\nThe Brock News.\nA year into her university studies, Shamae Quinquito (BSc ’23) received news that has had a lasting impact on her and her family.\nHer father lost his job due to COVID-19 pandemic layoffs, and she, her two sisters and mother had to take on additional work to support their already low-income family.\nThe money she had earned working full-time during a gap year between high school and university was already spent to cover the cost of her first-year courses, educational supplies and housing expenses to live away from her hometown, Kincardine.\nOn top of a full course schedule, Quinquito began working part time throughout the Fall and Winter Terms and worked 40-hour weeks during breaks so she could help her parents buy groceries and pay utility bills.\n“The sudden financial strain posed a significant challenge in my family,” said the Brock University Applied Health Sciences master’s student, who was in her first year of Brock’s Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Sciences program at the time. “I meticulously managed my time and finances — working and balancing my studies. It wasn’t always easy, and it required sacrifices and adjustments, but it taught me the importance of responsibility and looking out for my family.”\nThanks to the support she received from Brock’s student awards, such as the Dr. Yousef Haj-Ahmad Scholarship in Biology and Biotechnology, and the Horizon Graduate Student Scholarship, Quinquito has been able to financially support herself and help her family without sacrificing her education.\n“Brock helped me a lot throughout my journey,” she said. “The University is very supportive of students like me who are capable of doing well in school but are financially unstable.”\nThe financial support she received as an undergraduate student allowed her the time to focus on her studies, resulting in high academic marks and making the Dean’s honour list every year.\nQuinquito was also able to take on leadership roles in several academic-focused clubs that complemented her science education, such as the Faculty of Math and Science Council, the Human Anatomy Team program, Lab Links to Careers and Science Start. She became involved with the Interprofessional Education for Quality Improvement Program, where she evaluated the satisfaction and respite of clients and caregivers within Niagara Region’s senior program, and co-founded the Brock Learners Association, which hosted workshops to demonstrate strategies for effective learning, productivity, healthy habits and integrating technology into studying.\nAs she became increasingly interested in human anatomy and physiology, the opportunity to conduct research in her fourth year of undergrad set her on a path towards graduate studies.\nUnder the supervision of Assistant Professor of Kinesiology Stephen Klassen, Quinquito analyzed heart rate variability to understand the impact of long-term inactivity and presented her findings at the Mapping the New Knowledges Research Conference last year.\n“Defending my thesis in front of esteemed professors solidified my desire to continue conducting research in this field with Dr. Klassen,” she said.\nAs a master’s student, Quinquito is examining the cardiac physiology pathway and how different properties of blood vessels, like vascular compliance, contribute to exercise. She hopes it will offer greater insights into how humans increase blood flow to meet the metabolic demands of contracting muscles during exercise.\nShe is also enjoying learning about the specialized equipment needed to conduct her research, such as the ultrasound machine, and seeing pilot data that tells a new story about the mechanisms contributing to exercise\n“It’s a lot of fun because now I get to be hands on,” she said. “For my undergrad thesis, I focused on analyzing data, but now I’m the one actually running and using the equipment in the lab, and I think it makes a big difference knowing how the data came about.”\nLooking back at her journey to graduate studies, Quinquito says her experiences have made her resilient, financially independent and more confident.\n“I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished and who I’ve become,” she said. “Learning to manage my time effectively and understanding the importance of family support have shaped me into someone who can thrive in the face of adversity.”",

    "text": "Step 22 Adventure Travel Gear\nStep 22 Gear unveils aviation-friendly camping organizers at Sun ’n Fun, blending rugged design with smart storage solutions.\nA California company is at Sun ’n Fun this week, aiming to make fly-camping easier for pilots with innovative bags and organizers.\nStep 22 Gear—best known for its roll-up tool bags used in rugged races like the Baja 500—has been designing bags and organizers for hikers, campers, and adventure travelers for about five years. This year's Sun ’n Fun appearance marks its first foray into gear designed specifically for aviators.\nCompany representative Joel Moranton explains that while their competitors also offer traditional items like toiletry bags, Step 22 stands out by adding thoughtful extras. Their toiletry bag, for example, not only organizes items in a variety of ways but also features a bottom section that folds out into a mini shelf—ideal for holding a towel or toothbrush while searching for other items.\n“We do more than make adaptable systems that can carry just about anything in an organized way,” Moranton says. “Military-style MOLLE-strap systems are just the beginning. We also offer expandable hook-and-loop straps, closures, and folding or nesting setups that work for anything from cooking implements and consumables to clothing and electronic gear.”\nStep 22 also prioritizes durability without compromising weight. “You shouldn’t have to replace a bag after just one season—much less one trip,” Moranton emphasizes.\nLearn more about Step 22 Gear at step22gear.com.\nMark TimneyAuthor\nSubscribe to Our Newsletter\nGet the latest Plane & Pilot Magazine stories delivered directly to your inbox",

    "title": "Pope Francis Encourages Divine Mercy Novena Starting Good Friday, Calls for Global Participation",
    "text": "As the world prepares to embrace the solemnity of Good Friday, Pope Francis has urged the faithful to commence the Divine Mercy novena, a powerful nine-day prayer devotion that seeks to immerse souls in God's boundless mercy . Highlighting the novena's significance, Pope Francis reminisces on its origins through St. Faustina Kowalska and its profound ability to transform lives and foster peace and justice worldwide.\nAdvertisment Origins and Significance The Divine Mercy novena, introduced by St. Faustina Kowalska, serves as a conduit for God's mercy, drawing individuals closer to the divine through specific prayer intentions and the Chaplet of Divine Mercy. Initiated on Good Friday, this devotion aligns with Jesus Christ's sacrificial love, encouraging participants to reflect on mercy's role in personal and communal healing. Pope Francis, echoing his first Easter message, underscores mercy as an \"abyss beyond our comprehension,\" capable of revitalizing the driest of lands and souls.\nPrayer Structure and Intentions Advertisment Structured around the Chaplet of Divine Mercy, the novena comprises daily prayers, including the Lord's Prayer, Hail Mary, and the Apostles' Creed, followed by specific supplications for various groups such as sinners, priests, devout souls, and non-believers. Each day's intention is aimed at beseeching God's mercy for the world's hardships, especially at life's end. The pope's call to action emphasizes the novena's universal appeal, inviting the faithful to become agents of mercy and channels for divine grace.\nGlobal Participation and Impact Pope Francis' endorsement of the Divine Mercy novena reflects a broader vision for a world imbued with mercy, justice, and peace. By participating in this devotion, believers worldwide unite in a spiritual journey that transcends geographical and cultural boundaries, fostering a sense of global community and shared humanity. The pope's message resonates with a call to action, urging individuals to embody mercy in their lives and relationships, thus contributing to a more compassionate and equitable world.\nAs the Divine Mercy novena begins this Good Friday, the faithful are reminded of the transformative power of God's mercy. Through collective prayer and reflection, participants are invited to delve into the depths of divine love, seeking solace and strength in the midst of life's trials. Pope Francis' advocacy for the novena serves as a beacon of hope, encouraging a global embrace of mercy as a cornerstone for building a more just and peaceful world.",

    "text": "The Minns Labor Government has today unveiled its plan to deliver secure jobs and long-term funding to the state's community services sector-benefiting over a million people who rely on these essential support services each year.\nThe Secure Jobs and Funding Certainty (SJFC) roadmap sets out a vision for a strong, stable, and sustainable community sector-one where funding certainty and job security empower service providers to plan ahead, support their staff, and deliver outcomes for the communities who need them most.\nUnder the former Liberal-National Government, community service organisations were trapped in a cycle of short-term, insecure funding-forced to reapply for government grants, often every year. This uncertainty flowed directly to the workforce, with many frontline staff experiencing job insecurity.\nIn contrast, the Minns Labor Government is delivering long-term certainty with five-year funding contracts. This reform means organisations can plan ahead, invest in their workforce, and focus on helping the people who need it-not fighting their way through funding applications.\nWe know that many people across NSW are doing it tough right now-facing housing stress, cost-of-living pressures, and increased demand for critical support. Community service organisations are on the frontline, helping people navigate these challenges every day.\nThese key reforms will bring greater stability to the sector-through five-year funding contracts, less red tape, and more secure jobs, with a focus on permanent employment pathways. More than 7,800 non-government organisations across the sector are expected to benefit, along with the 240,000 workers they employ and over one million people they support each year.\nThese frontline workers-most of whom are women-play a critical role in supporting the most vulnerable people in our community. Their critical work has been especially vital during times of crisis, from natural disasters to the pandemic, and in responding to issues like homelessness and domestic and family violence.\nThis reform delivers on a key election commitment and was developed in partnership with peak organisations, government agencies and the Australian Services Union in consultation with the community services sector.\nThe NSW Government will continue working closely with the sector to turn this shared vision into lasting outcomes for communities across the state.\nUnder the SJFC roadmap, longer term contracts will be balanced by clearer performance and outcome expectations, ensuring taxpayer money is being used effectively and efficiently, and always for the benefit of the community.\nFurther information on the SJFC roadmap is available here: https://dcj.nsw.gov.au/service-providers/secure-jobs-and-funding-certainty-for-community-services.html\nMinister for Families and Communities and Minister for Disability Inclusion, Kate Washington, said:\n\"This is about backing the people who back our communities.\n\"The community services sector shows up every day for children, families, and vulnerable people across NSW-and they deserve the security to keep doing that vital work with confidence.\n\"This roadmap reflects a shift in how we work with the sector-towards longer-term partnerships built on trust, accountability, stability, and shared purpose.\n\"It's a foundational step in building a stronger, more sustainable sector-because when we support the people who care for our communities, everyone benefits.\"\nSecretary, Australian Services Union NSW/ACT, Angus McFarland said:\n\"The community sector workforce is made up of thousands of skilled and experienced workers, mostly women, who provide essential supports and services to the people of NSW.\n\"This roadmap is an important step in the government delivering on its election commitment to provide more permanent jobs for these workers via longer-term funding for the sector.\n\"The ultimate beneficiaries of these reforms are the people of NSW. Five-year funding contracts enable more permanent jobs in the community sector. This means greater stability for both the workers in the sector and for the community when accessing these vital services.\"\nNSW Council of Social Services CEO, Cara Varian said:\n\"We welcome the NSW Government's plan to give essential community workers secure jobs and stable funding.\n\"This plan shows that the government values the workers and organisations that spend their days helping the most vulnerable in our communities. They provide critical frontline services to support people facing homelessness, poverty, domestic violence, and trauma. This is essential work that strengthens communities and improves the health, wellbeing and resilience of NSW.\n\"This initiative represents a step change in the approach to human services contracting and commissioning in NSW. We commend this positive first step and look forward to building on this reform to strengthen and support the community services sector in NSW. We look forward to working with the Minister to make sure these services stay strong and continue changing lives for the better.\"\nhere.",
