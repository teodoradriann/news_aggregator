    "text": "ATLANTA — Believe it or not, the [northern lights](/article/weather/northern-lights-possible-over-georgia-tonight/85-8caec653-eaee-471a-a7ff-c3c12f944dac) were back over north Georgia on Thursday night! A phenomenon that is rarely seen this far south has now made two appearances in the Peach State here in 2024. But what is causing this? It is because there is a G4 geomagnetic storm reached the earth today. That is from a coronal mass ejection from the sun a couple of days ago. As this energy makes it to the earth, it disturbs the magnetic field, which can sometimes allow visibility of auroras in the sky. If you look north in the sky and see faint hues of red, purple, pink, or green -- that is the northern lights. Those in the state are sending in their magnificent photos of the northern lights in the clear, starry skies in Georgia. Keep sending in your photos on the 11Alive Weather Impact Facebook page or by using the \"Near Me\" section on the 11Alive app. Let's take a look at all the photos being sent in from 11Alive viewers across the northern part of the state:",

    "text": "Monseñor Nouel. El vertedero a cielo abierto donde depositan la basura el municipio de Bonao, lleva seis días afectado la salud de los moradores de varias comunidades, por la humareda que se desprende de un incendio.\nLa gran cantidad de humo que afecta a sectores como Hato Viejo, El Verde, Caribe y el municipio cabecera de Bonao, ha llevado a los alcaldes y encargados distritales que integran la provincia Monseñor Nouel tengan que solicitar la declaratoria del estado de emergencia.\nLos comunitarios mostraron su malestar debido a que la humareda empieza a provocar problemas respiratorios.\nMiguel Antonio Abad, capitán del cuerpo de bomberos de Bonao dijo que el denso humo y la contaminación derivada del fuego están afectando la calidad del aire y genera molestias respiratorias en la población.\n“No tenemos certeza de cómo se incendió el vertedero, lo que sí sabemos es que el basurero está fuera de control”, expresó Abad. En el lugar se encuentran bomberos de Bonao, Sabana del Puerto y de Juma.\nSe espera que se integren los cuerpos de bomberos de Maimón y Piedra Blanca. Los bomberos de Bonao evalúan si el siniestro fue provocado por manos criminales.\nLos alcaldes de las demarcaciones afectadas por el incendio del vertedero consideran urgente una solución al problema de la humareda. Ante el clamor, la gobernación provincial de Monseñor Nouel se comunicó con los alcaldes para manifestar su disposición a trabajar de manera mancomunada.\n“Ese humo nos acerca día y noche. Estamos en unas condiciones en las que podemos dormir en nuestras casas. Las autoridades que vengan y eliminen este vertedero y que no suceda lo mismo”, expresa Carlos Jiménez Peralta.\nEn ese sentido, Peralta está solicitando al presidente Luis Abinader intervenir para que sea clausurado el vertedero.\nEl Sindicato de Camioneros de Monseñor Nouel se ha sumado a los esfuerzos para contener la emergencia, colaborando con camiones cisterna y otras herramientas disponibles.",
