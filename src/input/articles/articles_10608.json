    "title": "NYC Congestion Pricing Is Seemingly Dead—In Favor Of Payroll Taxes",
    "text": "In a surprise reversal, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that planned congestion pricing in Manhattans Congestion Relief Zone will be shelved indefinitely—seemingly putting an end to what had been a contentious policy.\nThe plan, which was set to begin on June 30th, would have charged passenger vehicles up to $15 to enter Manhattan south of 60th Street. It would have been administered by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and was intended to curtail vehicle traffic in and below Midtown—specifically by out-of-state drivers.\nIn the near term, it seems lawmakers are considering raising taxes on local businesses to make up the financial difference, Bloomberg Tax reported.\nCongestion Pricing Shelved Hochul cited economic concerns and the lingering effects of the Covid-19 pandemic in support of her plan to shelve the congestion pricing policy. She primarily acknowledged the financial strain the policy would place on New Yorkers, noting the increase in the cost of living over the past five years.\nIn her address on affordability and cost of living, Hochul emphasized the $15 toll would burden working- and middle-class families and potentially hinder the city’s economic recovery.\nMORE FOR YOU Apple iPhone 16 Pro To Boast Record Breaking Design Leak Claims Samsung Issues Critical Update For Millions Of Galaxy Users Today s NYT Connections Hints And Answers For Thursday June 6 However, a payroll tax on local businesses as a means to aid the city’s economic recovery has its flaws and the proposal could exacerbate existing challenges. Small business are, as Hochul noted, already grappling with repercussions from the pandemic—introducing a payroll tax would increase their operational costs. As of 2022, small businesses account for 98% of New York State firms , and as such an added strain on small businesses is an added strain on business writ large.\nA payroll tax could further discourage new businesses from setting up in the city and prompt existing ones to relocate to more tax-friendly areas. In addition, jettisoning congestion pricing arguably would do nothing to ameliorate the cost to residents of additional traffic—ranging from environmental degradation to added transportation costs.\nInstead of fostering a conducive environment for business growth and recovery, a payroll tax pursued instead of congestion pricing would simply charge businesses an additional tax for the privilege of continuing to grapple with the same problems.\nCongestion pricing not only generates much-needed revenue for public transit improvements, but it also addresses the significant environmental and knock-on health effects associated with traffic congestion and pollution. By forcing drivers to internalize the externalities generated by their chosen method of transportation, such as increased emissions and traffic delays, the city can encourage a more sustainable transportation culture.\nOutlook Ultimately, the MTA board must decide whether to vote in line with the governor. The board is comprised of 23 members , with voting members nominated by the governor, New York City’s mayor, and one each from various county executive representing Long Island and communities just north of the city.\nKey decisions require the involvement and approval of the MTA Board, which is comprised of a chair and 16 other voting members, who are appointed by the governor with advice and consent of the state Senate. Substantial or general changes, in some cases, require a simple majority vote of the board. Consequently, it seems clear that a shelving of the board-approved congestion pricing plan will require a majority vote by the board.\nIf congestion pricing is shelved indefinitely, and absent a mechanism to internalize the cost of vehicle traffic, the burdens will continue to fall on the broader community, including those who do not use cars and opt for more environmentally friendly conveyances, like buses, subways and bicycles. Ultimately, this leads to a less efficient allocation of resources and burdens and perpetuates environmental degradation and health issues.\nAndrew Leahey Following",

    "text": "Portland Press Herald, Maine Strong winds cause power outages, displace Scarborough family Daniel Kool, Portland Press Herald, Maine Fri, January 3, 2025 at 4:59 AM UTC 3 min read\nJan. 2—Strong winds battered much of Maine on Thursday, breaking tree branches, knocking down power lines and forcing at least one family out of their home.\nScarborough firefighters responded to a report of a large tree branch crashing through the roof of 689 Route 1 late Thursday morning. Three people were in the home at the time, but no injuries were reported, Deputy Chief John Brennan said.\nThe house has been posted against occupancy \"out of an interest of safety,\" Brennan said. He added that Central Maine Power disconnected the building's electricity, as some outlets were ripped out of the wall.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement \"There were spots you could see up through to the sky,\" Brennan said. \"It did actually take the majority of the chimney as well.\"\nBrennan said the residents, who rent the home, are working with their landlord to find temporary accommodations while repairs are made. A licensed electrician will need to inspect and and fix the building's wiring before electricity can be returned.\nThat was the only significant property damage in town, though there were about a half-dozen other reports of fallen branches and downed lines, Brennan said.\nCMP reported roughly 5,400 outages statewide around 4:45 p.m. — with most located in Cumberland, Oxford and York counties. Versant Power, which operates mainly in the northern part of the state, did not report any outages.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Wind speeds hovered between 25 and 30 miles per hour with occasional gusts of up to 50 miles per hour anticipated.\nSugarloaf Mountain closed several lifts due to wind conditions, and additional wind holds are possible Friday morning, staff announced in the mountain's daily report.\nMichael Ekster, senior meteorologist at the National Weather Service's office in Gray, said the strongest winds appeared to be in the southern Maine. The Portland Jetport reported peak gusts of 49 miles per hour; but Augusta saw top speeds of just 35 miles per hour, he said.\n\"Right now, Portland looks like the highest,\" Ekster said around 4 p.m., noting that a final tally would be available later in the week.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in U.S. Pro-Ukraine special forces soldier shot himself before Cybertruck explosion The Telegraph Passengers kicked off flight with nowhere to go in travel nightmare: ‘People out on the streets like animals’ The Independent Historic ski resort announces immediate closure after battling decade of insurmountable conditions: 'Mother nature has not been kind to us' The Cool Down New Orleans attacker discussed plans to kill his family and join ISIS in chilling recordings. Here’s what we know CNN Maine usually sees windy bursts like Thursday around three to four times a winter, Ekster said. Typically, winds between 40 and 50 miles per hour do relatively little damage to the landscape, though they can create more problems in the summer and fall, when the trees still have leaves on them, he said.\n\"It's worse when there's leaves on the trees because they act like sails,\" Ekster said. \"A lot of times, the wind just kind of sails through the branches.\"\nThe wind is expected to die down overnight, coinciding with a drop in temperatures across the state. Ekster warned that windchills may dip into the negatives over the next few days, especially in inland and mountainous regions.\n\"The winds are going to be a lot less (Friday), but it's still going to be breezy,\" Ekster said. \"And that's going to coincide with the coldest air of the season.\"\nCopy the Story Link\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 25,399 people played the daily Crossword recently.
