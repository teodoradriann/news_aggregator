    "text": "Preamble of Constitution finds new readers after translation to local languages of Karnataka\nThe Alternative Law Forum has come up with translations of the Preamble to the Constitution in several of local Karnataka languages.\nExpress News ServiceBengaluru | June 12, 2025 13:14 IST\nThose familiar with the languages of Karnataka on a surface level might immediately think of Kannada, Konkani or Tulu, to name some, but these are just the beginning of the list. Dozens of languages are spoken by communities from district to district. The Alternative Law Forum, a collective of lawyers working on the accessibility of law, has produced translations of the Preamble to the Constitution in several of these languages.\nThese translations have so far been brought out in the languages Malame, Sanketi, Byari, Iruliga, Aruvu and Lambani. Iruliga is spoken by the Iruliga or Irula community, Lambani by the Banjara community, while Sanketi and Aruvu are Dravidian languages native to the state. Malame and Byari are spoken more in the region around Dakshina Kannada, with the latter being the language of the Byari/Beary Muslims. The ALF also plans to translate the Preamble into more languages as translators become available.\nAshwini Bodh, an ALF researcher working on the project, said, “We have translated the Preamble into these six languages so far.” She noted that the project has received a positive response from community members so far.\nShe added, “We conduct workshops about the Constitution across the districts to spread awareness. While travelling there, I saw people from these communities who were speaking these various languages and thought that nobody had done the translations into these languages.” Bodh noted that on the principle that something had to be done, whether it was a small or big language, she started the project with the help of translators.\nBodh added, “People do not know that much about the Preamble or the Constitution. At least if the Preamble is in their language, they feel that ‘this is ours’. We have planned several steps. One is the translation and poster design. The second is audio and video recordings via social media.”\nOne difficulty was the aspect of translation itself; subtleties of the language of the Constitution may not easily be communicated in different languages. Ashwini Bodh said, “Many people don’t have context for certain single values – such as liberty or fraternity. Many people may understand liberty as freedom – but it is not only freedom, it is a separate thing. Some words like that are a bit tricky and required proficiency, with three to four people working on translating and editing.”",

    "title": "Read the Original 32-Page Program for Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927) | Open Culture",
    "text": "One of the very first feature-length sci-fi films ever made, Fritz Lang’s Metropolis took a daring visual approach for its time, incorporating Bauhaus and Futurist influences in thrillingly designed sets and costumes. Lang’s visual language resonated strongly in later decades. The film’s rather stunning alchemical-electric transference of a woman’s physical traits onto the body of a destructive android—the so-called Maschinenmensch— began a very long trend of female robots in film and television, most of them as dangerous and inscrutable as Lang’s. And yet, for all its many imitators, Metropolis continues to deliver surprises. Here, we bring you a new find: a 32-page program distributed at the film’s 1927 premiere in London and recently re-discovered.\nIn addition to underwriting almost one hundred years of science fiction film and television tropes, Metropolis has had a very long life in other ways: Inspiring an all-star soundtrack produced by Giorgio Moroder in 1984, with Freddie Mercury, Loverboy, and Adam Ant, and a Kraftwerk album.\nIn 2001, a reconstructed version of Metropolis received a screening at the Berlin Film Festival, and UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register added it to their roster. 2002 saw the release of an exceptional Metropolis-inspired anime with the same title. And in 2010 an almost fully restored print of the long-incomplete film—recut from footage found in Argentina in 2008—appeared, adding a little more sophistication and coherence to the simplistic storyline.\nEven at the film’s initial reception, without any missing footage, critics did not warm to its story. For all its intense visual futurism, it has always seemed like a very quaint, naïve tale, struck through with earnest religiosity and inexplicable archaisms. Contemporary reviewers found its narrative of generational and class conflict unconvincing. H.G. Wells—“something of an authority on science fiction”—pronounced it “the silliest film” full of “every possible foolishness, cliché, platitude, and muddlement about mechanical progress and progress in general served up with a sauce of sentimentality that is all its own.” Few were kinder when it came to the story, and despite its overt religious themes, many saw it as Communist propaganda.\nViewed after subsequent events in 20th century Germany, many of the film’s scenes appear “disturbingly prescient,” writes the Unaffiliated Critic, such as the vision of a huge industrial machine as Moloch, in which “bald, underfed humans are led in chains to a furnace.” Lang and his wife Thea von Harbou—who wrote the novel, then screenplay—were of course commenting on industrialization, labor conditions, and poverty in Weimar Germany. Metropolis’s “clear message of classism,” as io9 writes, comes through most clearly in its arresting imagery, like that horrifying, monstrous furnace and the “looming symbol of wealth in the Tower of Babel.”\nThe visual effects and spectacular set pieces have worked their magic on almost everyone (Wells excluded) who has seen Metropolis. And they remain, for all its silliness, the primary reason for the movie’s cultural prevalence. Wired calls it “probably the most influential sci-fi movie in history,” remarking that “a single movie poster from the original release sold for $690,000 seven years ago, and is expected to fetch even more at an auction later this year.”\nWe now have another artifact from the movie’s premiere, this 32-page program, appropriately called “Metropolis” Magazine, that offers a rich feast for audiences, and text at times more interesting than the film’s script. (You can view the program in full here.) One imagines had they possessed backlit smart phones, those early moviegoers might have found themselves struggling not to browse their programs while the film screened. But, of course, Metropolis’s visual excesses would hold their attention as they still do ours. Its scenes of a futuristic city have always enthralled viewers, filmmakers, and (most) critics, such that Roger Ebert could write of “vast futuristic cities” as a staple of some of the best science fiction in his review of the 21st-century animated Metropolis—“visions… goofy and yet at the same time exhilarating.”\nThe program really is an astonishing document, a treasure for fans of the film and for scholars. It’s full of production stills, behind-the-scenes articles and photos, technical minutiae, short columns by the actors, a bio of Thea von Harbou, the “authoress,” excerpts from her novel and screenplay placed side-by-side, and a short article by her. There’s a page called “Figures that Speak” that tallies the production costs and cast and crew numbers (including very crude drawings and numbers of “Negroes” and “Chinese”). Lang himself weighs in, laconically, with a breezy introduction followed by a classic silent-era line: “if I cannot succeed in finding expression on the picture, I certainly cannot find it in speech.” Film history agrees, Lang found his expression “on the picture.”\n“Only three surviving copies of this program are known to exist,” writes Wired, and one of them, from which these pages come, has gone on sale at the Peter Harrington rare book shop for 2,750 pounds ($4,244)—which seems rather low, given what an original Metropolis poster went for. But markets are fickle, and whatever its current or future price, ”Metropolis” Magazine is invaluable to cineastes.

    "title": "Viral photo of forlorn Spiral Hot Dogs owner leads to booming business",
    "text": "An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for.\nDuring a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" Spirals: Hot Dogs & More ,\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral.\n\"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\"\nThe day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down.\nHosek wouldn't hear of it.\n\"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\"\n'I will always love you': See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her\nCustomer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance.\nNoticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\"\n\"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said.\nIn a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners.\nChappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit.\n\"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\"\nOwner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so.\nThe \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of.\nThe two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact.\nChappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family.\n\"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.\n1-cent Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger's are available at Wendy's this week. Here's how to get one.

    "text": "Mehr als 7.000 Schülerinnen und Schüler hatten sich in diesem Jahr an der Präventionskampagne der DAK-Gesundheit zum Thema Alkoholmissbrauch beteiligt. Bereits zum 16. Mal suchte die Kasse die besten Plakate gegen das Rauschtrinken. Bundesschirmherr ist der neue Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Sucht- und Drogenfragen Prof. Dr. Hendrik Streeck. Seit dem Start von \"bunt statt blau\" 2010 haben insgesamt rund 143.000 Schülerinnen und Schüler zwischen zwölf und 17 Jahren kreative Plakate gegen Alkoholexzesse gestaltet. \"Die Bundessiegerin macht mit ihrem Plakat Emotionen sichtbar: Junge Menschen, die sich durch Alkoholkonsum wie in Ketten gelegt fühlen und darunter leiden, stehen im Kontrast zu einem jungen Mädchen, das sich davon befreit hat. Es gelingt der jungen Künstlerin damit sehr gut zu veranschaulichen, wie positiv sich der Verzicht auf Alkoholkonsum auswirkt\", lobt Andreas Storm, Vorstandschef der DAK-Gesundheit das Plakat der Bundessiegerin Vivien Manzke. Gemeinsam mit dem Beauftragten der Bundesregierung für Sucht- und Drogenfragen Prof. Dr. Hendrik Streeck und Prof. Reiner Hanewinkel, Leiter des Instituts für Therapie- und Gesundheitsforschung (IFT-Nord), wählte Storm in der Bundesjury die ersten Plätze aus.\n\"Jede und jeder von ihnen hätte einen Preis verdient. Die Entscheidung fiel uns nicht leicht. Mein Glückwunsch an alle, die ausgezeichnet wurden\", sagt der Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Sucht- und Drogenfragen Prof. Dr. Hendrik Streeck. \"Als Schirmherr unterstütze ich diese Kampagne ausgesprochen gern. Wir brauchen viel mehr Aufklärung in den Schulen und natürlich auch zu Hause ein größeres Bewusstsein, wie gefährlich Alkohol für Kinder und Jugendliche sein kann. Da ist noch viel zu tun. Auch als Politik können wir unseren Beitrag leisten. Es ist richtig, dass wir endlich offen darüber sprechen, ob Regelungen wie das 'begleitete Trinken' noch zeitgemäß sind. Bier und Wein werden schließlich nicht gesünder, nur weil Erwachsene danebensitzen.\"\nMit dem Bundessieg kann sich Vivien Manzke über den Hauptpreis von 500 Euro freuen. \"Ich möchte mit meinem Bild zeigen, dass es einen Ausweg aus der Alkoholsucht gibt und dass die Hoffnung, insbesondere bei Jugendlichen, nicht stirbt, gesund zu werden und ein normales Leben zu führen\", beschreibt die 15-Jährige ihre Plakatidee. \"Mein Bild zeigt, wie sich ein Mädchen von den Ketten des Alkohols befreit. Es zeigt das Glücklichsein ohne den Alkohol, aber auch die Traurigkeit der Jugendlichen, die immer noch an Alkohol gekettet sind. Im Ganzen möchte ich mit meinem Werk Hoffnung zum Ausweg aus dem Alkohol für Jugendliche geben und auch klarmachen, dass niemand für immer in dieser Hölle stecken muss.\" Baden-Württemberg gewinnt in diesem Jahr Silber: Die 18-jährige Leonie Scholl aus Pforzheim holt sich Platz zwei. Bronze geht nach Hessen: Hier überzeugte die 18-jährige Eva Arkenbosch aus Hofheim am Taunus die Bundesjury. Der Sonderpreis in der Kategorie \"Junge Talente\" geht an Marlene Damm, 13 Jahre, aus Bremen. Beim Sonderpreis \"Social Media\" liegt Nordrhein-Westfalen vorne: Hier überzeugten Greta-Luise Schulte, Neele Radin und Leonie Steuerwald aus Lippstadt mit einem Videobeitrag auf YouTube.\n\"bunt statt blau - Kunst gegen Komasaufen\": Unter diesem Motto suchte die DAK-Gesundheit 2025 bereits im 16. Jahr die besten Plakatideen von Schülerinnen und Schülern zwischen zwölf und 17 Jahren zum Thema Rauschtrinken. Auch in diesem Jahr wurden zunächst in den Bundesländern Landessiegerinnen und Landessieger gekürt. Aus diesen Bildern wählte die Bundesjury die besten Plakate aus.\nZahlen des Statistischen Bundesamtes zeigen, dass die Zahl jugendlicher Rauschtrinkerinnen und Rauschtrinker weiter rückläufig ist. So mussten 2023 9.263 Jugendliche mit einem Rausch in Kliniken behandelt werden. Das war bundesweit ein Rückgang um 19 Prozent im Vergleich zum Vorjahr. 2022 waren es noch 11.472 Jugendliche gewesen. Dabei sanken die Zahlen in allen Altersgruppen (zehn bis unter 20 Jahre). Am stärksten nahm die Zahl der Rauschtrinkenden mit minus 21 Prozent bei den 15- bis 19-jährigen Jungen ab. Bei den Mädchen in dieser Altersgruppe sank die Anzahl der Rauschtrinkerinnen lediglich um 14 Prozent. Zum Vergleich: Der Auslöser zum Start von \"bunt statt blau\" im Jahr 2010 waren mehr als 25.000 Krankenhausbehandlungen von Minderjährigen mit einer Alkoholvergiftung.\nDer Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Sucht- und Drogenfragen Prof. Dr. Hendrik Streeck sagt ganz klar: \"Jeder junge Mensch, der mit einer Alkoholvergiftung in einer Klinik landet, ist einer zu viel. Darum brauchen wir weiterhin gute, passgenaue und vor allem frühzeitige Aufklärung in Kindertageseinrichtungen, Schulen, Sport- und Freizeitangeboten wie Vereinen und anderen Jugendorten. Kinder und Jugendliche sollen gar nicht zu Alkohol oder anderen Drogen greifen.\"\n\"Es ist ein gutes Signal, dass die Zahl der Klinikeinweisungen im Bereich Alkoholmissbrauch abnimmt\", sagt Andreas Storm. \"Die Entwicklung der Zahlen seit dem Start der Kampagne im Jahr 2010 macht deutlich, wie kraftvoll Präventionsinitiativen wie 'bunt statt blau' wirken können. Angesichts tausender Jugendlicher, die noch immer jährlich mit einem Vollrausch in der Klinik behandelt werden müssen, gilt es jedoch, dranzubleiben. Es ist wichtig, junge Menschen für die negativen Folgen von Alkoholkonsum zu sensibilisieren, aber ohne erhobenen Zeigefinger.\" Storm weiter: \"'Bunt statt blau' ermutigt Schülerinnen und Schüler dazu, ihren Umgang mit Alkohol zu hinterfragen. Der Schlüssel zum Erfolg ist eine Kommunikation auf Augenhöhe. Das macht 'bunt statt blau' so besonders.\"\nDie Präventionskampagne \"bunt statt blau\" ist eingebunden in die \"Aktion Glasklar\" des IFT-Nord, mit der die DAK-Gesundheit auch Lehrkräfte und Eltern über das Thema Alkohol aufklärt. Mit passgenauen Unterrichtsmaterialien wird das Thema Alkoholmissbrauch von Lehrerinnen und Lehrern aufgegriffen, bevor die Gestaltung der Plakate und Beiträge beginnt.\nWeitere Informationen: dak.de/buntstattblau\nPressekontakt:\nDAK-Gesundheit Pressestelle Telefon: 040/2364855 9411 Mail: presse@dak.de",

    "title": "Here's how credit card balances can cause holiday debt hangovers",
    "text": "By Cheryl Fiandaca ,\n1 hours ago\nHow to avoid paying soaring interest fees on credit card debt 02:52\nBOSTON - Credit cards are as important to the holiday shopping season as Christmas trees and wrapping paper.\nIf you're among the half of Americans who pay their credit card balance in full every month, you're ahead of the game. But, if you're in the other half who carry a balance, beware - interest rates have gone up and you'll be paying a lot more for those gifts.\n\"There's an industry saying that credit cards are like power tools, as in really useful or dangerous. It's all about how you use them,\" Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst at Bankrate, told WBZ-TV's I-Team. \"The point is that holiday debt hangover can be a nasty one and there's a lot of everyday pressure to spend. It's grocery bills. It's medical bills. It's gas. It's all these things that have already inflated credit balances. I would try not to make it worse around the holidays.\"\nCredit card balance math Here's the math on carrying a credit card balance:\nIf you owe $6,400, using the average credit card interest rate of about 20 percent and making just minimum payments, it will take 18 years and more than $9,000 in interest to pay it off.\nInterest rates on store credit cards are at an all-time high. The I-Team has learned that many big retailers, like Macy's, have been jacking up their interest rates to nearly 35-percent.\nPaying down credit card debt Companies like Affirm, Afterpay or Klarna can help a bit. They allow you to buy certain items and make payments over time.\n\"In many respects, they paint themselves as kind of the kinder, gentler alternative to a credit card,\" Rossman said. \"The key there is look at the total cost of ownership. Don't check yourself with the installments, think about what are you really paying and what are the terms? Sometimes it's interest-free over 6 weeks. Sometimes it's 20-percent interest over two years. That starts to feel more credit card like.\"\nSo what can you do if you end up in holiday debt?\nExperts say try to transfer your high interest rate balance to a no interest or zero percent card. If that's not possible, try to negotiate a lower interest rate from your credit card company. If that fails, look to get nonprofit credit counseling.\n\"We've actually found that about three-quarters of the time when people ask for a lower interest rate, they get it.\" Rossman said.\nMacy's did not respond to our request for comment. Consumer advocates also caution consumers about retailers offering discounts on purchases to customers who sign up for their store cards. Before agreeing, be sure you understand the terms. While there are no federal caps on interest rates, companies are required to disclose the card's interest rate, late fees and penalties.",
