    "text": "Maduro orders defensive military exercises before the arrival of a British ship to the coast of Guyana Venezuela moves troops in the area even as the neighboring country denies ‘plans for offensive action’ The president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, has ordered to start “defensive actions” in the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday after the arrival of a British warship off the coast of Guyana. The vice-president of that country, Bharrat Jagdeo, has shortly after denied “plans for an offensive” against its neighbor, who [claims sovereignty over the Essequibo, a jungle territory rich in minerals and oil.](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-12-11/resistance-from-essequibo-we-will-defend-ourselves-if-venezuela-dares-to-invade-us.html) “These are routine measures that are planned for a long time, they are part of building defense capabilities. We do not plan to invade Venezuela, President Maduro knows that. We have no plans to take offensive action against Venezuela,” Jagdeo added. Maduro, who spoke about the territorial conflict during his New Year’s message, has qualified the presence of the British Navy ship as a “threat [...] against peace and sovereignty”. His government also denounced it as an act of “hostile provocation” and a violation of [the bilateral agreements signed in mid-December in St. Vincent and the Grenadines](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-12-15/venezuela-and-guyana-agree-not-to-resort-to-arms-to-settle-essequibo-dispute.html). A couple of weeks of apparent calm followed the meeting between Presidents Maduro and Irfaan Ali, organized by Brazil with the support of the countries of the Caribbean Community (Caricom), to defuse the escalation of tensions between Venezuela and Guyana over control of the Essequibo. Now, the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry has said in a statement that the arrival of the military vessel HMS Trent is “extremely serious” and follows [the declarations of Guyana’s allies such as the United Kingdom and the United States](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-12-07/us-conducts-flight-operations-in-guyana-after-venezuelas-referendum-on-the-essequibo-region.html) in the territorial dispute. “Venezuela urges the Guyanese authorities to take immediate action for the withdrawal of the vessel and to refrain from continuing to involve military powers in the territorial dispute.” The Venezuelan Armed Forces announced the operational deployment of 5,600 soldiers on the country’s eastern coast, which includes disputed territorial waters. “We are going with the best disposition, with the best attitude of a trained combatant to guard Venezuelan territory and exercise sovereignty”, said Ashraf Suleiman Gutiérrez, head of the Strategic Region of Integral Maritime Insular Defense. The beginning of the mobilization of ocean patrol boats, ships, missile boats, F-16 and Sukhoi fighter planes, amphibious and anti-aircraft defense vehicles, among other equipment, was broadcast on television and authorized live by Maduro dressed in military attire. In the midst of an internal whirlwind after the primaries in which [the Venezuelan opposition closed ranks around candidate María Corina Machado](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-12-07/maria-corina-machado-and-the-conquest-of-the-chavista-far-west.html), Maduro has dusted off [a two-century-old conflict with Guyana over the sovereignty of the Essequibo](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-12-09/venezuela-and-its-territory-a-national-trauma.html), an extensive territory of 160,000 square kilometers, five times the surface of Belgium, with important mineral and oil riches. In the maps of 1777 the border of the Captaincy General of Venezuela included this area. But it was British Guyana, and later independent Guyana, which ended up occupying this territory. After the Paris Arbitral Award of 1899, a document considered rigged by Venezuela, Guyana’s border was moved westward to keep that portion within its limits. For decades, this controversy was mediated at the request of the United Nations in the framework of the Geneva Agreement of 1966 and five years ago led to the International Court of Justice, whose jurisdiction to settle this conflict is rejected by Venezuela. One day after the opposition primaries which mobilized more than two million Venezuelans, Maduro announced [ a referendum for December 3 in which the annexation of the Essequibo was approved,](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-12-04/venezuela-government-claims-victory-in-referendum-to-annex-essequibo-increasing-tension-with-guyana.html) albeit with participation levels that have been questioned, due to the low mobilization seen in the streets and the absence of disaggregated results on the votes. Alarm bells went off in Latin America and were even discussed in an informal session of the UN Security Council. In spite of this, [Maduro pushed forward](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-12-06/venezuela-guyana-dispute-maduro-mobilizes-the-army-and-announces-annexation-of-essequibo.html) and appointed authorities in the region, ordered the registration of its citizens and decreed a new map of the country with the Essequibo. Guyana, which in recent years has granted oil concessions in the disputed waters, also followed suit with the hoisting of its flag in the disputed sector and the mobilization of its allies in the field of diplomacy. This is a simmering tension that [might be politically exploited by Chavismo,](https://english.elpais.com/opinion/2023-12-08/nicolas-maduro-maneuvers-with-guyana.html) according to several analysts, [in order to suspend the 2024 presidential elections,](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-12-05/with-its-referendum-on-essequibo-venezuelas-government-opens-a-new-front-to-ensure-absolute-control-until-the-2024-presidential-elections.html) in which it would be at a disadvantage if it is forced to comply with the democratic guarantees demanded by the international community, under the argument that an escalation with Guyana would force it to declare a state of emergency. After the meeting in St. Vincent and the Grenadines on December 14, the parties agreed to continue in dialogue and to avoid taking measures that could further complicate the situation. A couple of weeks later, the small Caribbean country was also the venue for the exchange of U.S. prisoners for [the businessman Alex Saab, ](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-12-26/alex-saab-and-the-path-towards-fair-elections-in-venezuela.html)arrested for money laundering in the United States, which accuses him of being a frontman for high-ranking officials of the Maduro government, but that Venezuela claims as a diplomat. The issue of the Essequibo, on which the Government deployed an intense propaganda campaign, seemed to be buried for a few weeks following the new steps taken in the negotiating table between Chavismo and the United States, which has relaxed its sanctions, in order for Maduro to move towards competitive elections in 2024, such as the possible enabling of Machado to compete freely; a matter on which a decision of the Supreme Court is expected this last week of 2023, just when the waters between Venezuela and Guyana seem to be choppy once again.

    "text": "All homes that lost power as Storm Gerrit lashed Scotland have now been reconnected, bosses at power firm SSEN have confirmed. The electricity provider said its teams had worked through “particularly challenging conditions” to restore supplies to more than 48,000 homes. A final push by staff saw the last properties without electricity reconnected by 11pm on Friday, with customers in parts of Aberdeenshire, Perthshire and The Great Glen area in the Highlands all now with power again. Andy Smith, SSEN distribution’s operations director, said the storm had brought “serious disruption” with gale force winds having reached recorded speeds of 86mph in Inverbervie, Aberdeenshire and 84mph in Lerwick, Shetland. Mr Smith said: “Storm Gerrit caused serious disruption across the north of Scotland, and I would like to say thank you to our customers for their patience while we worked through some particularly challenging conditions to reconnect them, as quickly and safely as possible. “I’m very proud of the work undertaken by SSEN’s operational teams, and for being out at all hours and in all weathers to find and fix the faults over the past few days. “I would also like to extend my gratitude to our contract partners and fellow network operators for how they supported our response.” SSEN is now encouraging customers who were left without power to apply for compensation, depending on how long they were without electricity for. Completion of work to restore electricity supplies comes ahead of the latest weather alert, with a yellow warning for rain and snow having been issued for much of Scotland on Saturday. As a result of that Network Rail Scotland said speed restrictions will be in place on the West Highland Lines from 10am today until 9am on Sunday.",

    "text": "Secciones Servicios Destacamos EP Viernes, 13 de septiembre 2024, 11:46 Necesitas ser suscriptor para acceder a esta funcionalidad. Opciones para compartir El sindicato de los trabajadores de Boeing en en la región de Seattle (EE.UU.) ha convocado una huelga por primera vez en 16 años y ha rechazado la oferta del fabricante para subir un 25% los salarios. Según recoge DPA, el 94,65% de los trabajadores votaron que no a la oferta que lanzó Boeing para evitar los paros, que contemplaba una subida salarial del 25% en cuatro años, mejorar en las coberturas sanitarias y las jubilaciones, dado que el sindicato IAM había pedido inicialmente un incremento del 40% en los salarios. Además, el 96% apoyó la convocatoria de huelga. La huelga ha comenzado a las 00.00 hora local de este viernes para unos 30.000 trabajadores. Los representantes sindicales han señalado en una rueda de prensa recogida por 'Bloomberg' que los puntos del acuerdo no eran lo suficientemente buenos y que la oferta no compensaba los 16 años de estancamiento salarial, el aumento de los gastos sanitarios y la deslocalización de miles de empleos sindicales. Por su parte, Boeing ha emitido un comunicado en el que muestra su compromiso para restablecer la relación con los trabajadores y el sindicato, además de volver a la mesa para alcanzar un nuevo acuerdo. Boeing atraviesa una crisis de reputación, de seguridad y económica desde 2019, cuando dos aviones 737 MAX sufrieron accidentes fatales. Tras esto, se han producido otros incidentes, como la caída de una parte del fuselaje de un avión de Alaska Airlines a principios de este año.

    "text": "By Helen Regan and Kocha Olarn, CNN Oct 3, 2024 Oct 3, 2024 Updated 2 mins ago Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Bangkok (CNN) — Flash floods swept through a popular elephant sanctuary in northern Thailand on Thursday, forcing the evacuation of about 100 elephants and trapping dozens of tourists, amid urgent pleas for help.\nDramatic video and images from the Elephant Nature Park near the city of Chiang Mai showed dozens of elephants wading through belly-deep water to find safety on higher ground.\n“It was the biggest evacuation we have ever done to save their lives, the water rose rapidly,” Saengduean “Lek” Chailert, founder of Elephant Nature Park, told CNN, calling the floods the most severe the park has ever experienced.\nVideo showed park staff who work with elephants, known as mahouts, shouting, “Go go, keep going” as they urged the huge pachyderms out of their pens and through the high floodwaters.\nWhile many of the animals found shelter on a nearby mountain overnight Thursday, come morning, Saengduean said the danger was far from over.\n“There are some animals we could not evacuate yesterday. Thirteen adult elephants are still trapped in their quarters. They are panicking,” said Saengduean.\nNorthern Thailand has suffered severe flooding and landslides in recent weeks due to torrential rains brought by Typhoon Yagi, Asia’s most powerful storm this year, which left dozens dead as it swept across the region in mid-September.\nAuthorities in Chaing Mai, a popular tourist destination in Thailand, have issued alerts for potential flooding as water levels along the Ping River, which runs through the city, reach dangerous levels.\nWith extensive flooding around the park and waters still rising, the sanctuary’s founder said they are facing the unwelcome prospect of having to evacuate the animals a second time.\n“The situation is a lot worse than yesterday,” she said, adding that she has requested urgent help from Thai authorities.\nA priority is getting hold of boats so the mahouts can stay with the remaining elephants at the park to keep them calm, she said.\n“We urgently need volunteers and animal cages as we must move the animals to the mountains due to the roads being completely cut off in both directions,” the park said in a post on Facebook.\nAbout 30 foreign volunteers are also trapped at the sanctuary, including five Americans, some of whom have been working at the park for several weeks, Saengduean said.\nThe Elephant Nature Park is an elephant rescue and rehabilitation center in the Chiang Mai countryside that has rescued more than 200 elephants from the tourism and logging industries since its inception in the 1990s. It also runs tours and volunteering programs that allow visitors to observe the animals or help with conservation work.\nMany of the elephants are blind or have physical injuries, which have hindered their ability to escape and complicated evacuation efforts.\n“Among the evacuated animals, there are many sick elephants, some barely walk. We had to help them to get to the foot of the mountain. We are in desperate need for help,” Saengduean said.\nAs well as elephants, the park is home to about 5,000 rescued animals including dogs, cats, horses, pigs and rabbits – some of which were evacuated in recent days after authorities issued a flood warning.\nThe head of Thailand’s Department of National Parks said that dozens of officers have been dispatched but have been unable to reach the park due to flooded roads, according to the state-run National Broadcasting Television. Atthapol Charoenchansa said they urgently need flat-bottomed boats and volunteers to help evacuate the remaining animals.\nSeveral villages in Chiang Mai’s Mae Rim district have been inundated by water from upstream runoffs, local media reported Thursday.\nElephants, Thailand’s national animal, have seen their wild population decline in recent decades due to threats from tourism, logging, poaching and human encroachment on elephant habitats.\nExperts estimate the wild elephant population in Thailand has dwindled to 3,000-4,000, a decline from more than 100,000 at the beginning of the 20th century.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "Amazing software, with an interesting collection of oddities.\nAmazing software, with an interesting collection of oddities.\nPosted Apr 2, 2025 23:24 UTC (Wed) by himi (subscriber, #340)Parent article:\nCatching up with calibre\nThat said, the reason it's the default recommendation isn't that it's beautiful, user-friendly, intuitive or even necessarily entirely coherent - it's the default recommendation because *nothing* comes close to it for functionality and support. Outside the server space it's hard to think of any other piece of Free Software that's so dominant in its niche.\nThere a definitely a lot of oddities about the way it works - the article discussed many. The one that bit me for ages was the behaviour of the downloadable installation script: it wanted to install to system locations, and didn't provide any way to configure this - in particular, attempting to install as a regular user into ~/.local resulted in either a partially broken (but still usable) installation, or needed to be run as root so that it could install some desktop customisation files into locations under /usr. After a bunch of digging into the script I figured out a way to resolve the issues and get it all installed happily under ~/.local - mostly a matter of doing an \"isolated\" install into ~/.local/libexec and then running the calibre_postinstall script separately. I did make an effort to implement some changes to the way the installation script is generated to improve things, but Life(tm) got in the way . . .\nThe statistics collection is something I'd never heard of, and definitely counts as another oddity - it's hard to care too much about *this* particular minor privacy breach (from a personal perspective) in this day and age, but such things should certainly be made more visible.\nAnd Kovid Goyal definitely deserves much respect for his work - calibre is an amazing piece of software and an extraordinarily successful project, and kitty is an excellent terminal, and as a project has been very influential in helping modernise terminal emulators in general.",

    "text": "Unresolved ethnic grievances have always led to violence throughout history, no matter how long they stay dormant. And ashes, they say, sometimes, cover some hot spots that can trigger fires and flames, as so do, ethnic disparities and injustices in countries.\nThey often lead to a breakdown of systems and governance followed by violence and eventually a breakdown of countries into their constituent ethnic groups. Former Yugoslavia is generally taken as an example of one of the most recent countries which broke down into its component parts through a violent process.\nThe Soviet Union also broke down into many parts although the process there was not violent as the center understood it would lose more than keeping together its varied component communities, although the consequences of such breakdown in the Soviet Union is currently manifested in the Russian/Ukraine war.\nIf the leadership of a country which consists of nations brought together in the past through force are not wise enough to keep them together through creation of a nation state where all are equal and where one group does not dominate the others, it is bound to confront an opposition and once that opposition turns to violence, it can lead to a breakdown and the seeking by the aggrieved parties of total independence.\nEthiopia is one such country that was created through conquests. It was kept together as a country through an imperial system which was replaced by a military dictatorship, followed by a dominant ethnic group in an ethnic-based federal system, held together always by military force.\nThis was replaced by the current continuing federal government, which put in power the largest ethnic group in the country, in the hope this would calm the boiling ethnicity in the country. In the beginning, everything went as well as it could.\nThe new administration freed all political prisoners, brought back exiled opposition groups, made peace with one of its arch enemies, Eritrea. It earned the Prime Minister a Nobel Peace Price in a short period of about a year. He came in 2018 and got the price the next year in 2019.\nUnfortunately, he started a war the next year in 2020 with one of the ethnic states of the country, Tigray, which is reported to have killed people in the hundreds of thousands if not in the millions. Nobody knows exactly how many people died directly through bullets or through the aftereffects of war through hunger, diseases, and through shear fatigue, specially the old, the young, the mothers and those who had physical disabilities.\nThe war with Tigray was followed by the continuing war with the Amhara State, where again thousands are being reported to have died so far. The Benishangul-Gumuz is not at peace and there are wars in the Oromia State, where violence dating back to decades has been going on.\nThe state against state wars in the country have increased.The Somali and Afar States have been at war with each other over claims and counterclaims of land, and the Somali/Oromia states are not at ease. The Ahara and the Tigrayans have been fighting each other over the past three years while there is no love lost between the Amhara and the Oromo who are also fighting each other while all of them are fighting the Ethiopian state.\n The push by the Oromo into Somali territories is not liked by Somalis and could trigger another violent war at any time, especially in the Faafan province, with Jigjiga as its capital. Somalis are not happy that Dire dawa is already removed from its territory, as a federally administered city instead of being the Somali city it was always.\nThis has tarnished the Nobel Peace Price earned by the Prime Minister. It has also led to a weakening of the economy, allowing the world’s multilateral financial institutions of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to intervene and promise to support the country financially through conditioned financing. One of such conditions included the devaluation of the Ethiopian Birr, moving away Monetary control of the Central bank of the country, the National Bank of Ethiopia, and bringing in market forces to determine the price of the currency.\nIt all looks good on appearance and at first sight but instead of leading the country to stability, it may lead to more instability. All the promised funds would not be disbursed at once but would be calibrated to conditions that the Ethiopian government should meet on an agreed schedule. This may lead to poverty, inability of people, and especially the large poor populations of the country, to be able to acquire or buy what they need to survive in terms of food, shelter, clothing and even for those with some capital to import and build houses or capital goods and equipment. Its export revenues would certainly not cover its import bills.\nAs a pivotal nation in the region, Ethiopia would have to maintain sufficiently large armed services. Would she be able to do so, with an economy that is bound to falter or with the continuing violence in the country? This is bound to become more complicated, as its foreign policy has, lately, been making all the wrong moves.\nIt has antagonized practically every country in the region from Eritrea to Djibouti to Somalia. It is the countries that it needed most to be on its side. They are the countries with whom it should have formed the Horn of Africa States as an economically integrated region. It also antagonized Egypt which is dependent on the Blue Nile waters as a source of most of its freshwater.\nBut more than that, it has joined the BRICS and appears to have taken sides, when it should have stayed a neutral state in the uncertain world of today. It has, therefore, in one stroke offended the countries that have always been on its side through out the past hundred and fifty years, allowing it to even expand to its current geographical space.\nRelying on military might, as it did in the past, to suppress the many ethnic groups of the country, may not work in the future. It is still unable to pacify Tigray and the Amhara War. The Benishangul unrest and the other conflicts in the country, are all going on, leading to a divided nation, which may not meet all the stringent conditions of the IMF and the World Bank.\nAll of these and many others, point to the need for Ethiopia to change course, and perhaps the easiest one, which is of its own making is to walk back away from the MoU it signed with one of the regions of Somalia and the fantasy that it should have access to a sea. Although it may not remove the hostilities created, it would reduce the impact and the drain of the worsened relationship with Somalia.\nIt should also abandon the unfeasible and unreasonable desire to have access to a sea. No country in the region will give up its territorial lands and waters to another, even through long term rents, which represent a stealthy way to acquire a sea connection. The declarations of the Ethiopian Prime Minister over various media outlets perfectly make it clear what he wants for his country, and this is not possible, at least, in these present times. The Prime Minister could have negotiated better terms through an integrated regional economic system, but unfortunately, he only made matters harder. But a walk back from this unwarranted overt want to have access to a sea, would certainly ease some of his problems.\nThis would enable him to deal with the other internal issues with more concentration, not through force but through reasoning and common sense. The best way to deal with a fellow human being is to treat him as you would expect him to treat you. He should make peace in his country in the place of exporting violence and chaos to others. He should also make peace with all the neighboring countries and should learn to deal with some countries like the United Arab Emirates with its paycheck diplomacy at arms length.\nHe should learn from the mistakes of the Ethiopian administration before him, which was marked by domination by one ethnic group in both the public and private affairs of the country. He should not allow his ethnicity to do the same although it is currently apparent he did not deviate from that wrong path. He could certainly move away from the policies he followed over the past five years and go back to his first year in office and learn lessons from there.",
