    "text": "News Article\nFebruary 27, 2025 Study Finds Radon Exposure Increases Odds of Gestational Diabetes Key Takeaways Higher radon exposure is linked to increased gestational diabetes risk in nulliparous pregnant individuals, with a 37% increase in odds at levels ≥2 pCi/L. The study examined interactions between radon, smoking, and PM2.5, finding increased GD odds in high-radon and high-PM2.5 or smoking environments. Radon exposure may induce oxidative stress, inflammation, and placental damage, contributing to gestational diabetes development. Further research is needed to confirm findings and assess individual-level residential radon exposure impacts on gestational diabetes risk. SHOW MORE Radon exposure during pregnancy was significantly linked to increased odds of gestational diabetes.\nNew study findings published in JAMA Network Open announced that higher radon exposure is linked with greater odds of developing gestational diabetes (GD) among nulliparous pregnant individuals, emphasizing the importance and awareness needed around environmental risk factors in maternal health strategies. 1,2\nImage credit: tonefotografia | stock.adobe.com\n“Our primary objective was to examine the association between county-level radon exposure and the risk of GD in a large, racially and ethnically diverse sample of pregnant individuals in the US. We also explored the interactions of radon exposure with smoking and PM 2.5 given the potential shared pathways related to the development of GD,” the study authors said in a news release. 1\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, GD impacts approximately 10% of pregnancies annually in the US. 1 Similar to other types of diabetes, GD affects how the cells use glucose, causing high blood sugar that affects the health of the pregnancy and offspring. While symptoms of GD often go unnoticed, they can present as increased thirst and more frequent urination. 2 GD could also increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease among mothers and increase the risk of childhood obesity. 1\nEnvironmental influences like fine particle matter air pollutants (PM 2.5 ) and smoking have been greatly recognized and connected with GD risk, suggesting a potential link between radon and GD; however, evidence involving radon exposure to GD is limited. The radioactive gas seeps into homes and is known to cause lung cancer, emphasizing the need to establish other potential health risks it can trigger. 1\nThe researchers conducted a multicenter, population-based cohort study using data from the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be (nuMoM2b) cohort, which included nulliparous pregnant participants from 8 US clinical centers between October 2010 and September 2013. A total of 9107 individuals were included and analyzed from September 2023 to January 2024. Among the 9107 individuals, 3782 individuals never used tobacco. 1\nThe study authors noted that Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory compiled county-level radon data from the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) home assessments, categorizing exposure into 3 levels: under 1, 1 to under 2, and 2 or more picocuries (pCi/L). To investigate potential shared biological pathways, the study further categorized participants by combined radon and smoking status, as well as combined radon and PM 2.5 levels. 1\nClinical diagnosis of GD was measured based on the glucose tolerance test (GTT) and information from medical record abstraction. Additionally, various logistic regression models were used to evaluate the connection between radon exposure and GD. 1\nThe results demonstrated that among nulliparous pregnant individuals, the average county-level radon concentration was 1.6 pCi/L, with 4.2% experiencing GD. After adjustments, individuals in counties with radon levels of 2 pCi/L or higher showed 37% increased odds of GD (OR 1.37, CI 1.02-1.84), which remained similar after accounting for PM 2.5 (OR 1.36, CI 1.00-1.86). 1\nFurther results demonstrated that ever smokers in high-radon counties had 209% increased odds of GD (OR 2.09, CI 1.41-3.11), and those in high-radon and high-PM 2.5 counties had 193% increased odds (OR 1.93, CI 1.31-2.83), although interactions between these factors were not statistically significant. 1\nThe findings suggest a significant link between county-level radon exposure during pregnancy and increased odds of GD, especially when combined with high PM 2.5 levels or smoking. The results highlighted radon’s ability to induce oxidative stress, inflammation, and potential placental damage as contributing factors to GD. However, the study authors noted that further research is needed to confirm the findings and assess individual-level residential radon exposure. 1\nREFERENCES 1.

    "title": "Washington State Wants Pharmacists to Prescribe Dangerous Abortion Drugs That Kill Babies and Harm Women - LifeNews.com",
    "text": "What if a pharmacist could not only dispense abortion pills, as the Biden administration has recently made possible, but prescribe them? Pharmacists in the state of Washington, taking advantage of provision in state law allowing pharmacists to prescribe drugs, are completing a training program that will enable them to be certified to prescribe and deliver abortion pills to women in their state, says Patrick Adams in a January 22, 2024, report for National Public Radio (NPR).\nThe vision is not simply to expand abortion pill access in Washington State, but to serve as a model for other states.\nTaking advantage of newer FDA rules\nIt was only about a year ago when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), at the behest of the Biden administration, announced new regulations allowing for pharmacies to be certified to dispense mifepristone, the abortion pill.\nBesides needing to have a designated person to fill out and manage all the paperwork, this person had to be familiar with the prescribing information, insure that prescriptions came from certified prescribers whose information was on file and confirm with the prescriber that the drug was appropriate for the patient.\nFollow LifeNews on the MeWe social media network for the latest pro-life news free from Facebook’s censorship!\nThis essentially means that prescriber and pharmacist both have to make sure that the patient has been appropriately screened for various conditions or drug allergies, making sure they are within the appropriate gestational range (no more than ten weeks past a woman’s last menstrual period), and making sure that they do not have an ectopic pregnancy, which the drugs do not treat.\nThe pharmacist who is planning to ship these drugs to women’s homes has to track and record all shipments and guarantee their delivery within four calendar days.\nAny patient deaths are to be reported back to the prescriber, who in turn is to report these to the distributor, who reports these to the FDA.\nAt one point, prescriptions were limited to doctors, but under regulations in place since 2016, these can be prescribed by any “certified healthcare provider.”\nUnder those terms, the drugs can be prescribed by any doctor, nurse, physician assistant, or any other healthcare provider –- such as a pharmacist.\nSo long as they meet the certification requirements, largely mirrored in the pharmacy certification conditions, they can receive certification and FDA permission to prescribe and distribute the drugs.\nIf there is a difference in the two certifications, it is that the prescriber has to certify that they personally have the ability to accurately date pregnancy, diagnose ectopic pregnancy, provide or refer for any necessary surgical intervention, and can assure patient access to medical facilities equipped for blood transfusion.\nThey also need to make sure the patient is fully briefed on mifepristone risks, has any questions answered, and signs appropriate agreements.\nAbortion pill advocates have sought to interpret these very loosely. They claim these tasks can be accomplished without an in-person physical exam (or ultrasound) in a teleconference, or even a phone call, or a online questionnaire. As of January 2023, the FDA appears to be allowing if not endorsing that interpretation with its new protocol.\nState of Washington takes advantage\nUnder the new regulations, it isn’t clear why any pharmacist in any state might not be able to qualify as a prescriber. But Washington state’s law explicitly authorizing pharmacists to prescribe medications certainly makes it easier.\nMore than forty years ago, Washington passed a law setting up “collaborative practice agreements,” or CPAs. These allowed licensed prescribers such as to physicians or nurse practitioners to delegate authority to a pharmacist to prescribe or administer certain drugs. This enabled the state to use pharmacists to provide some limited healthcare and boost immunization rates among underserved Native American communities in the state.\nDon Downing is a pharmacy professor who was part of that program in the 1970s and served as a pharmacist medical provider on area reservations. This past spring, shortly after the Biden administration announced the new certification system, Downing and several of his colleagues set up the Pharmacy Abortion Access Project. This focused on training community pharmacists to screen chemical abortion patients, prescribe abortion pills, and dispense them from their stores.\nDowning told NPR that most women live close to their community pharmacy and see their pharmacist twice as often as they do their primary physician. Being more familiar, Downing seems to feel, women may be more comfortable seeking abortion pills from their local pharmacist than their doctor. Pharmacists are also more accessible to patients, with drug stores being open in the evenings, on weekends and holidays, often available without need for any appointment.\nTen pharmacists are part of Downing’s first “class,” and he expects them to be prescribing abortion pills sometime in the next few weeks. No word on how Downing means to ensure that the FDA grants certification within that time frame. However, his training program includes not only instruction on how to screen patients remotely without ultrasound, pelvic exam, or bloodwork, but also how to implement the treatment regimen and handle follow-up care.\nDowning believes Washington’s program can be a model for other states.\nNPR’s Patrick Adams writes about a bill being considered in New York state that would grant pharmacists authority to prescribe abortion pills there. Researchers in San Diego, California recently published results of a pilot study claiming to show that pharmacists could safely and effectively prescribe abortion pills in that state.\nNPR believes that there are already a few pharmacists in California who received advance practice certification and are legally allowed to prescribe the abortifacient pills.\nExperts offer differing opinions\nNaturally, like so many other propaganda pieces encouraged by the abortion establishment, the article wraps up with statements by industry “experts” that chemical abortions are “extremely effective and extremely effective.”\nPro-life doctors who challenged the FDA’s new laxer prescription criteria in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA , the case being heard by the Supreme Court in April this year, know better.\nWhen the FDA expanded the prescriber pool to include non-physicians and dropped requirements for in-person visits, those doctors claimed this made misestimations of gestational age more likely, decreasing effectiveness and increasing the likelihood of complications.\nThey also believed this increased the risk of undetected ectopic pregnancies, which can prove deadly to the mother if they rupture.\nThis is in addition to the risks of hemorrhage, infection, and failure normally faced by users of the abortion pill.\nIf the Supreme Court rules in favor of pro-life doctors, it could mean that pharmacists in Washington and elsewhere will not be writing these prescriptions.\nLifeNews.com Note: Randall O’Bannon, Ph.D., is the director of education and research for the National Right to Life Committee .",
