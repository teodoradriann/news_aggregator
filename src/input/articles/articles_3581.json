    "text": "Sir Alex Ferguson: Paul Scholes says it was 'distasteful' and 'disrespectful' to end legend's ambassador role Published 24/10/2024 at 20:01 GMT Paul Scholes has called the decision of INEOS and Manchester United to cut Sir Alex Ferguson's ambassadorial contract as \"distasteful\" and \"a little bit disrespectful.\" The United legend, who won 38 trophies in a 26-year reign as manager, saw his role as ambassador terminated by INEOS as part of a cost-cutting procedure that has seen hundreds of club staff lose their jobs. Paul Scholes has reacted to INEOS' decision to terminate an ambassadorial contract with Sir Alex Ferguson, calling the move \"distasteful\". Ferguson is Manchester United's most successful manager, winning 38 trophies over 26 years, and was appointed as an ambassador following his retirement in 2013. Company accounts in 2014 show that the Scotsman's role earned him a salary of £2.16 million, and that agreement lasted for over a decade. But his role has been terminated as part of cost-cutting measures at Old Trafford. \"I felt it was a little bit distasteful for what that man has done for the club, almost a little bit disrespectful,\" Scholes said on TNT Sports. \"But they're new owners and new owners make changes, and they think what they're doing is best for the club. \"Now if they think they can save whatever money it is, I know it's been said about £2m, I don't know if that's correct, but if they think they can use that elsewhere then so be it. \"But this club owes a lot to Sir Alex Ferguson, it's where it is now mainly because of the success he had for so many years. \"And probably the timing of it was a little bit poor as well, because they're in a really bad run of form. Could you have waited or done it before the season started, done it at the end of the season? \"The publicity wasn't great around it, but Sir Alex will be fine, he'll go on, he'll still be the best ambassador this club could ever have.\" It is understood that Ferguson and the club reached an amicable agreement to cease his duties at the end of the current season, and that he will continue to remain as a non-executive director on the club's board. The decision marks a major step forward in Jim Ratcliffe's cost-cutting drive at United after 250 staff members were removed from the [club's payroll in the summer.](https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/05/sir-jim-ratcliffe-cuts-250-jobs-to-save-manchester-united-about-10m-a-year)TNT Sports will show over 500 matches from the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League and the UEFA Conference League across the 2024-25 season.

Lo rende noto la Gendarmeria Vaticana. Il Papa ha parlato di guerra (e di pace), di donne, della situazione di Haiti e del Ramadan.\n“Preghiamo per la pace nella martoriata Ucraina e in Terra Santa. Cessino al più presto le ostilità che provocano immani sofferenze nella popolazione civile” ha detto Bergoglio. “Seguo con preoccupazione e dolore la grave crisi che colpisce Haiti e i violenti episodi avvenuti negli ultimi goirni. Sono vicino alla chiesa e al caro popolo haitiano che da anni è provato da molte sofferenze. Invito a pregare perché cessi ogni sorta di violenza e tutti offrano il loro contributo per far crescere la pace e la riconciliazione nel paese con il sostegno rinnovato della comunità internazionale”. E ha aggiunto: “Stasera i fratelli musulmani inizieranno il Ramadan. Esprimo a tutti loro la mia vicinanza”.\n ",

    "text": "ROME— Pope Francis on Thursday washed the feet of 12 prisoners at a prison facility in Rome, with the pontiff continuing a regular tradition of holding the Mass of the Lord’s Supper at local penitentiaries.\nThe Holy Father told female inmates at the Rebibbia correctional facility, located about six miles from Vatican City, that Jesus “never tires of forgiving” but rather “we are the ones who get tired of asking for forgiveness.”\n“We all have our small or big failures — everyone has their own story. But the Lord always awaits us, with his arms open, and never tires of forgiving,” the Holy Father said, according to Vatican News.\nThe pope during the Mass washed the feet of 12 of the female prisoners present. The dozen inmates were of “different nationalities,” the Vatican said.\nThe pope subsequently “met with the inmates and staff of the penitentiary” and received several gifts including products from the prison complex’s farm.\nIn years past, Francis has traveled to prisons and other facilities in and around Rome to wash the feet of marginalized individuals.\nIn 2023 he washed the feet of 12 young men and women at the Casal del Marmo juvenile detention center on Rome’s outskirts.\nFrancis instituted the custom shortly after the start of his papacy. After visiting the Casal del Marmo youth detention center in 2013, he presided at Holy Thursday Masses at a center for the disabled in 2014, the Rebibbia New Complex Prison in 2015, a center for asylum seekers in 2016, Paliano prison in 2017, Rome’s historic Regina Coeli prison in 2018, and Velletri men’s prison in 2019.\nThe Holy Father skipped the tradition in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "text": "Pro-Palestinian protesters blocking the Van Wyck Expressway by JFK Airport on Dec. 27, 2023. Stephen Yang for NY Post\nFormer NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton is right: The city needs to start treating unruly pro-Hamas “protesters” as the goons they are — especially as they’re mobilizing to target the iconic New Year’s Eve celebration in Times Square.\nPolice officers should not be treating the volatile, traffic-snarling, antisemitic “Flood NYC for Palestine” demonstrators with kid gloves.\nThey’re not simply exercising their free-speech rights: They’re attacking civic life.\nThey’ve done their best to disrupt the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade, the annual tree lighting at Rockefeller Center, Christmas services at St. Patrick’s Cathedral and caroling in Washington Square Park.\nThey’ve targeted commuters by aiming to close Grand Central and blocking the Brooklyn Bridge, and harassed holiday travelers by closing traffic at JFK.\nThis isn’t speech, it’s intimidation and blackmail.\nAs Bratton advises, the city should be hitting them with criminal charges that can “screw them up for the rest of their damn lives.”\nHe’s also right that the city gave up crucial public-order ground in settling the lawsuit over the also-unacceptable “protests” after the 2020 death of George Floyd.\nBad enough that City Hall agreed to pay $13 million — nearly $10K per rioter arrested during that summer’s looting and arson; worse that the Adams administration put an end to NYPD “kettling” of disruptive crowds, which allowed for orderly resolution of civic-blackmail efforts like the pro-Hamas crew is pulling now.\nMayor Adams defended that as ensuring that “we are both protecting public safety and respecting protesters’ First Amendment rights”; now he admits it has made officers “hesitant” in handling large, out-of-control marches.\nHe blames the advice of city lawyers for accepting the kettling ban; sorry, sir, the buck stops at your desk.\nIt’s time to tear up that agreement and let Police Commissioner Edward Caban and the NYPD’s ranks do their job.\nThese “protesters” are warring on your city, Mr. Mayor: Stop the pre-emptive surrender.",

Os conselheiros de campanha de Trump e aliados próximos o escreveram – e estão fazendo tudo o que podem para elegê-lo para que ele possa executar seu manual imediatamente”, diz o texto de apresentação do portal.\nA proposta, segundo a campanha democrata, dá diretrizes a serem implementadas por Donald Trump caso o candidato republicano vença as\neleições deste ano.\nDe acordo com a campanha de Biden, a agenda política proposta por aliados de Trump é uma ameaça à Constituição dos EUA, além de usar a presidência para se vingar de inimigos pessoais e de controlar os “freios e contrapesos democráticos” do poder presidencial.\nO debate entre Joe Biden e Donald Trump acontece nesta quinta-feira (27/6), a partir das 21h (horário de Brasília).",
