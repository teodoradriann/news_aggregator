    "text": "Some 538 people with flu and 282 with Covid-19 were treated in emergency departments this week\nThe number of people attending emergency departments with Covid-19 infections doubled this week, with 54 outbreaks of the disease reported in hospitals and nursing homes across the country.\nThere was also a 72 percent increase in the number of patients presenting with flu in the past seven days, and the Health Service Executive (HSE) has warned that infection numbers are likely to continue rising in the coming weeks.\nSome 538 people with flu and 282 with Covid-19 were treated in emergency departments this week, compared to 312 and 144 respectively during the preceding seven days.\nThe HSE has said everyone must play their part to protect hospitals from becoming overwhelmed.\n“Hospitals and community services around the country have put a sustained effort into ensuring hospitals are positioned for the traditional post-Christmas demand,” said a spokesperson.\n“However, the rise in flu and Covid infection is very steep, and we would urge the public to attend the ED only for major health emergencies. Use all other options in non-emergency situations.”\nPeople are advised to use their local pharmacies and visit the HSE.ie website before going to their GP or ED if they have respiratory symptoms. The HSE is also advising people to get vaccinated at their GP clinic or pharmacy.\n“If you are unwell, you should stay at home until 48 hours after your major symptoms have resolved; avoid visiting people who are more vulnerable if you are unwell, especially avoid visiting hospitals or nursing homes.”\nDr Colm Henry, the HSE’s chief clinical officer, said the rise in flu and Covid rates in the coming weeks would put “significant pressure” on hospitals and residential care facilities.\n“Our emergency departments are expected to encounter significant pressures as a result and we know from experience that a delayed peak in flu season such as we are seeing now, will inevitably lead to further pressures throughout the healthcare system with heightened risk of outbreaks in all facilities and delays discharging patients to nursing homes or step down facilities if they have flu or Covid,” he said.\n“Vaccination remains the best way to reduce the incidence of these respiratory illnesses. The HSE is urging every eligible person to get vaccinated against flu and Covid as soon as possible.”\nThe new JN.1 variant of Covid-19 is fast becoming the dominant strain, and is more transmissible, resulting in more infections, according to Dr Éamonn O’Moore, director of national health promotion.\n“We are still collating data in Ireland and internationally on whether it will result in more illness requiring hospital care but at this time we are not seeing that signal. However, with more infection around, there is greater risk some people who are vulnerable could become ill and require hospital care and we still need to protect our vulnerable members of society, children and adults, by doing what we can to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.”\nJoin the Irish Mirror’s breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

Y, en el mismo sentido, la misa del jubileo de los diáconos, que se celebrará el domingo, ha sido delegada en el monseñor italiano Rino Fisichella, pro-prefecto del Dicasterio para la Evangelización.\nCuadro clínico complejo\nEl Papa ha impuesto un gran hermetismo alrededor de su hospitalización. Apenas se sabe que el Pontífice, que en los últimos días había pasado por una gripe, sufre una infección respiratoria \"polibacteriana\" que le ha obligado a cambiar de medicación dos veces en los últimos días. En los partes del lunes, también se informó de no sufre fiebre, aunque el cuadro clínico es \"complejo\".",

    "text": "Equipes dos bombeiros enfrentam desde a segunda-feira um grande incêndio no centro histórico de Lima, que afeta vários edifícios comerciais e pode se prolongar até o fim de semana, informou nesta quarta-feira (5) um dos chefes do órgão responsável pela emergência.\nPor ora, as autoridades não reportaram mortes nem feridos.\nO fogo, ativo há 48 horas, começou na tarde de segunda-feira em um depósito de brinquedos e alimentos envasados que funcionava sem licença em um edifício de Barrios Altos.\nAs chamas se propagaram rapidamente por entre as ruas estreitas de um setor onde “os armazéns estão misturados com as casas”, disse ao Canal N o brigadista Carlos Malpica, da Corporação Geral de Bombeiros Voluntários do Peru.\nDe acordo com o balanço divulgado nesta quarta, são cinco edifícios mais “afetados”, que têm entre cinco e oito andares em média.\n“Estamos no centro histórico de Lima, [e aqui] tudo são armazéns. Nossas residências estão no meio de uma bomba-relógio”, disse à AFPTV Zulli Cabanillas, que teve que deixar sua casa.\nMesmo diante da magnitude das chamas, vários moradores conseguiram sair a tempo com alguns pertences como geladeiras, cadeiras e colchões.\nO fogo gerou uma fumaça preta e tóxica – causada pela queima de materiais como plásticos – visível a vários quilômetros de distância.\nA televisão registrou o colapso de pelo menos quatro edifícios, que segundo Carlos não respeitavam “nenhuma normativa”.\nAlém disso, os prédios não contam com escadas de emergência, “não há acessos com facilidade”, nem sistema contra incêndios ou aspersores, segundo o chefe dos bombeiros.\nE dos poucos hidrantes que há, nem “todos estão funcionando”. É necessário oito ou dez vezes mais água para lidar com o incidente, explicou.\nDadas essas condições, Carlos afirmou que o incêndio “vai” até domingo, o que o tornaria um dos de maior duração em Lima em épocas recentes.\nOs bombeiros inflaram várias piscinas na área do incêndio, que funcionam como cisternas, mas ainda assim o volume de água es insuficiente.\nQuase 50 unidades, que somam cerca de 300 efetivos no total, respondem à emergência.\nSegundo Mario Casaretto, designado pela prefeitura de Lima para o gerenciamento da emergência, a área foi evacuada rapidamente, o que evitou uma tragédia maior.\nContudo, há “11 famílias atingidas”, sustentou Casaretto em uma coletiva de imprensa transmitida pelos meios de comunicação.\nljc-vel/ag/rpr",

    "title": "3 Simple Ways to Eat Asian Pears - The Tech Edvocate",
    "text": "Introduction:\nAsian pears, also known as nashi or apple pears, are a delicious and healthy fruit native to East Asia. They have a unique texture that is both crisp and juicy, making them a refreshing snack or a versatile ingredient in various dishes. If you’re looking for ways to enjoy this delightful fruit, here are three simple methods to incorporate Asian pears into your diet.\n1. Enjoy them raw as a healthy snack:\nOne of the easiest ways to eat Asian pears is simply to enjoy them raw. They make for a tasty and nutritious snack that can be eaten at any time of the day. Just follow these steps:\n– Rinse the pear under cold water to remove any dirt or debris.\n– Pat it dry with a clean towel.\n– Using a sharp knife, slice off the top and bottom of the pear.\n– Cut the remaining fruit into wedges or slices.\n– Optionally, you can remove the core and seeds before eating.\nKeep in mind that Asian pears bruise easily, so handle them with care when slicing and storing.\n2.

    "text": "CNA Staff, Dec 29, 2023 / 06:00 am (CNA). Pro-life institutions continued to be targets of pro-abortion attacks in 2023 following the landmark Supreme Court decision in June 2022 overturning Roe v. Wade. Roe, the 1973 case that legalized abortion nationwide, was struck down on June 24 — the solemnity of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus — with the decision on the Mississippi abortion case Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. “The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each state from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives,” the majority opinion in the case said. Before Roe’s downfall, news of the imminent Dobbs opinion was [leaked to the media](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251115/supreme-court-will-overturn-roe-v-wade-according-to-draft-opinion). Enraged pro-abortion activists began [targeting Catholic churches](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251169/ruth-sent-us-abortion-group-threat-catholic-masses) as opportunities to disrupt worship. Some [defaced churches](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251185/tabernacle-stolen-catholic-church-defaced-pregnancy-clinic-vandalized) with threatening graffiti, while others disrupted Mass by screaming and [chanting pro-abortion slogans](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251531/nearly-naked-protester-disrupts-mass-in-michigan). Just weeks before Roe’s overturn, an armed California man [was arrested](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251490/armed-man-arrested-supreme-court-justice-brett-kavanaugh-home) near the residence of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh for threatening to kill him. Kavanaugh sided with the majority in the Dobbs decision. Pregnancy resource centers and other pro-life institutions [came under attack](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251174/threats-to-catholic-masses-mothers-day) as well. Some organizations were burned in arson attacks. Others were left threats written in graffiti. Many clinics had their windows smashed. The attacks only got worse once Roe was officially overturned in June, and they continued throughout 2023, with the latest reported act of vandalism occurring this fall at a group of Catholic churches. The attacks In January, St. Stephen Catholic Church in Riverview, Florida, had a pro-life sign on its grounds vandalized, according to [The Patch](https://patch.com/florida/bloomingdale/fl-church-responds-prayer-abortion-issue-divides-communities). The sign, which said “Abortion stops a beating heart,” was graffitied with the words “Save the pro-choice mom.” That same month, two hooded individuals were caught on camera vandalizing a pro-life pregnancy center in Houston. The leader of the clinic [told CNA](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/253552/leader-of-houston-pro-life-pregnancy-center-says-pro-abortion-vandalism-was-racist) that the vandals wrote “Abortion for all” on the front of the clinic and glued the locks on the entrance of the facility. In March, vandals smashed the windows of First Care pregnancy center in Minneapolis and spray-painted it with graffiti, saying: “If abortions arn’t safe neither r u” and “Jane was here.” “ [Jane’s Revenge](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251518/what-is-janes-revenge-pro-abortion-vandalism),” or iterations of it, such as “Jane was here,” became a calling card of sorts for dozens of pro-abortion vandals after the May 2022 leak from the Supreme Court. One clinic in New York that was spray-painted with “Jane’s Revenge” graffiti in 2022 in an [arson attack](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251477/police-investigation-fire-graffiti-at-upstate-new-york-pro-life-pregnancy-center) was [vandalized](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/253893/ny-pregnancy-center-that-was-set-on-fire-is-hit-again-with-jane-s-revenge-rhetoric) again this past March. The word “liars” was spray-painted in red capital letters across CompassCare’s sign at its 1230 Eggert Road, Amherst, location. The same month police arrested 39-year-old Hannah Kamke in connection with the crime and charged her with one count of criminal mischief in the third degree, which is a Class E felony and holds a [maximum penalty](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/70.00) of up to four years’ imprisonment. Kamke entered a plea agreement and avoided jail time, agreeing to pay $2,580 in restitution, according to [Buffalo News](https://buffalonews.com/news/compasscare-hannah-kamke-vandalization-abortion-clinic/article_e5013582-53f0-11ee-b2f9-ab736913de2d.html). The vandals who set that clinic on fire last year and caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages still have not been identified by police or the FBI, despite the bureau’s offer of a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. The following month, in April, the words “Liars,” “Fake clinic,” “Jane’s Revenge,” “Fund abortion,” and “Abort God,” were scrawled across Bowling Green Pregnancy Center, also known as HerChoice, in Bowling Green, Ohio. Federal charges were filed against a 20-year-old college student in Ohio, Whitney Durant, who goes by the name Soren Monroe, for allegedly vandalizing the clinic. Durant pled guilty this month in federal court to a misdemeanor under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act and faces a maximum of one year in prison. Her sentencing is set for April 9, 2024. The FACE Act [prohibits](https://www.justice.gov/crt/protecting-patients-and-health-care-providers) “violent, threatening, damaging, and obstructive conduct intended to injure, intimidate, or interfere with the right to seek, obtain, or provide reproductive health services.” Durant’s prosecution under the FACE Act is a milestone for the Department of Justice, which has [disproportionately targeted pro-life activists](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/255433/republicans-urge-repeal-of-weaponized-face-act-due-to-anti-pro-life-bias) under the statute. Kristen Clarke, assistant attorney general of the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, said that “defacing facilities that provide reproductive health services will not be tolerated in our society” after Durant’s guilty plea. In the past five months alone, the DOJ [convicted](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/256036/elderly-pro-life-activist-with-significant-medical-issues-convicted-on-face-act-charge) nine pro-life activists under FACE Act charges related to the Oct. 22, 2020, sit-in in which they blocked access to the clinic’s abortion services, according to prosecutors. During the blockade of the clinic, which was livestreamed on Facebook, some of those who sat inside the clinic can be seen praying the rosary and singing hymns to the Blessed Virgin Mary while refusing to leave. The most recent of the nine to be convicted is [Paulette Harlow](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/256036/elderly-pro-life-activist-with-significant-medical-issues-convicted-on-face-act-charge) of Kingston, Massachusetts, 75, who has severe health issues and could face up to 11 years in prison. In May, a Catholic-based clinic, JMJ Pregnancy Center in Orlando, Florida, had three mutilated animals left on its property consisting of a chicken, a large bird, and baby lamb. The director of the clinic [told CNA](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/254329/mutilated-animals-left-on-pro-life-pregnancy-centers-property-in-orlando) at the time that he thought “there was probably some kind of ritual that was involved.” In July, a pregnancy center in Las Vegas was attacked with graffiti that said “Fraud,” among other words, according to [8 News Now](https://www.8newsnow.com/news/local-news/vandals-target-las-vegas-pregnancy-center/). The “a” in fraud was drawn in the shape of an anarchist symbol. In October, there were a series of pro-abortion attacks at Catholic churches in Ohio ahead of the state’s November referendum to enshrine abortion rights into law. That referendum ultimately passed. Churches in Centerville, Cincinnati, Clifton, and Oxford [had signs targeted](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/255889/pro-abortion-vandals-target-ohio-catholic-churches-schools-before-issue-1-vote) that were encouraging Ohioans to vote no on the referendum. Incarnation Catholic Church in Centerville was targeted with graffiti in addition to its signs being vandalized. CNA has [counted](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251553/map-vandalism-attacks-continue-at-pro-life-centers-across-us) more than 60 pro-life pregnancy centers and almost 40 Catholic churches that have been targeted since the overturning of Roe v. Wade. In January, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a [resolution](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/1233/text) condemning recent attacks on pro-life facilities, groups, and churches. The resolution also called on the Biden administration to use law enforcement to keep the institutions safe.

    "text": "Trending:\nNASA Warns Of Big Aeroplane-Sized Asteroid To Make Close Contact With Earth Tomorrow: Are You Safe?\nA Big 91-foot asteroid is set to make its close distance towards Earth tomorrow. Is it potentially hazardous? Know all the details.\nAsteroid\nNASA has issued an alert concerning an asteroid known as 2024 VC4, which will fly close to Earth on November 16, 2024, at 1:42 IST. The space stone is as big as a large airplane and is 91 feet in diameter. Passing at a staggering speed of 69,486 km/h, it will fly at a distance of 2,500,000 kilometres from Earth.\nWhat Is Asteroid 2024 VC4?\nAsteroid 2024 VC4 is a Near-Earth Object (NEOs) belonging to the Apollo group. Such asteroids have orbits that sometimes cross with the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Though large and close, 2024 VC4 does not qualify as a \"potentially hazardous asteroid\" in terms of size or proximity.\nCould Asteroid 2024 VC4 Pose a Threat?\nNASA defines “potentially hazardous asteroids” as those larger than 492 feet in diameter and passing within 7.5 million kilometres of Earth. While 2024 VC4 comes relatively close, its size is much smaller than the threshold for a significant threat. Nevertheless, scientists remain cautious, as even minor deviations in an asteroid's orbit could alter its trajectory.\nOngoing Monitoring and Preparedness\nNASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) is dedicated to tracking NEOs like 2024 VC4. Advanced tracking systems and global observatories, including Pan-STARRS and NASA’s NEOWISE, provide precise data to ensure early detection of potential threats. These efforts also help refine our understanding of asteroid behaviour and readiness for any future risks.\nAlthough 2024 VC4 will pass safely by Earth, NASA’s vigilance in monitoring space rocks underscores the importance of early warning systems and preparedness in safeguarding our planet. Rest assured, there’s no reason for concern with this celestial flyby.\nGet\n[Latest News](https://www.timesnownews.com/latest-news)Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from[Technology Science](https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science)and around the world.Trending:\nEnd of Article\nSubscribe to our daily Newsletter!\niPhone SE 4 Release Date, Price In India, Specifications: What To Expect From Apple In 2025?\nWhat Google's Antitrust Case Reveals About Apple’s Secret Ad Plans\nDigital Arrest Scam Costs IIT Bombay Student Rs 7.29 Lakh: What Is It, How To Stay Safe\nNASA Alert! 130-ft Airplane Sized Asteroid Racing Through Space At Over 62000 kmph: Are We Safe?\nGoogle Parent Alphabet Gets Green Light To Buy Stake In Flipkart, Deal Details Inside",
