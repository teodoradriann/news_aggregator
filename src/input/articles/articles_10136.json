    "title": "Google abandons the Pixel Tablet 2 and possibly the tablet market",
    "text": "History is repeating itself at Google which once again seems to be throwing in the towel on the tablet market. After the relative failure of the Pixel Tablet launched in 2023, the Mountain View giant has reportedly decided to cancel the development of its successor. News which is strangely reminiscent of the abandonment of 2019, when Google had already given up on this segment following negative reviews of its Pixel Slate. This is yet another product that the research specialist is about to abandon.\nA commercial failure that leads to abandonment According to cross-information from Android Authority And The Verge Google has reportedly made the decision to stop development of the Pixel Tablet 2, codenamed “kiyomi”. This decision would be motivated by disappointing sales of the first generation and fears of financial losses on a new model. However, recent rumors still mentioned the arrival of a keyboard accessory and new features.\nThe Pixel Tablet, marketed at €599 with its docking station (currently at €349 alone), will therefore not have succeeded in establishing itself against Apple’s iPad. A situation which is reminiscent of the historical difficulties of Android in the tablet market, where the system still suffers from a lack of optimized applications compared to iPadOS.\nOn the other hand, confusion remains over the fate reserved for the Pixel Tablet 3 planned for 2027. We do not know if the development of this one has been abandoned to the extent that some sources claim that it would still be on track. We will know more in a few months, but its future is clearly uncertain.\nWhat future for large screens at Google? If Google seems to abandon classic tablets, the company could refocus its efforts on other formats. The Nest division could notably take over by developing new fixed screen devices, in line with the current Nest Hub and Hub Max. The idea would be to push home automation to compete with the Amazon Echo and a potential connected touch screen from Apple. It also wants to strengthen its computers under ChromeOS.\nThis news once again confirms the domination of the iPad in this market. While Apple’s tablet is celebrating its 13th anniversary with constant success, Google is still struggling to offer a viable Android alternative in the long term, despite some promising attempts like the Nexus 7 at the time. It is interesting to note that this decision comes in a context where Apple continues to dominate the tablet market, with a market share exceeding 36% last quarter according to IDC. The difficulty for Google to compete with the iPad/iPadOS ecosystem therefore seems to have got the better of its ambitions in this sector. It is clear that in the tablet market, it is essential to have perfect mastery of the software and hardware to hope to succeed, and Apple has a big head start.\nSource",

    "title": "Steve Garvey, California GOP SILENT in Face of Draft Dodging Claims",
    "text": "Last Updated on December 28, 2023 Steve Garvey, the California GOP, and the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball organization are SILENT in the face of claims that Steve Garvey, a Republican candidate to be the next US Senator from California, dodged the Vietnam War draft with help from the aptly-named Los Angeles Dodgers, for whom he was playing professional baseball at the time. National File has reached out to [Steve Garvey](https://nationalfile.com/tag/steve-garvey/) directly for comment but after confirming that it was indeed Steve Garvey who answered National File’s phone call, the California US Senate candidate hung up when questioned about his alleged Vietnam War draft dodging. [CLAIM: Steve Garvey Falsified Medical Records to Dodge Vietnam Draft, With Help from LA DODGERS!](https://nationalfile.com/claim-steve-garvey-falsified-medical-records-to-dodge-vietnam-draft-with-help-from-la-dodgers/) Likewise, National File has reached out to multiple members of the Los Angeles Dodgers front office and media team but has received no response on claims that the storied ball club helped Steve Garvey dodge the Vietnam War draft when he was playing first base at Dodger Stadium. As shown in the [exclusive National File X post](https://twitter.com/NationalFile/status/1740083965136900416) below, among others, Erik Braverman, the Senior Vice President of Marketing Communications, and Broadcasting for the Los Angeles Dodgers, has opened multiple emails regarding the organization’s alleged role in Garvey draft dodging claims but has refused to respond. The email continues to be read. [pic.twitter.com/MRbbktu80R] — National File (@NationalFile) [December 27, 2023] In addition to the Los Angeles Dodgers, National File has made California GOP Chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson [aware](https://twitter.com/NationalFile/status/1740097785406353497) of allegations that Garvey, the leading GOP Senate candidate who’s backed by California’s McCarthy-linked GOP establishment, dodged the Vietnam War draft to save his baseball career. Like Garvey and the Dodgers, Jessica Millan Patterson has refused to comment on the Garvey situation and refuses to disclose the California GOP’s role in Garvey’s campaign, or whether or not the party supports Garvey’s alleged draft dodging scheme. You are now aware that Steve Garvey is a DRAFT DODGER. (screenshot below) You're aware Steve Garvey may or may not have enlisted the help of the LA Dodgers in his scheme to dodge US Military service, and that there is PRIMARY SOURCE DOCUMENTATION in… — National File (@NationalFile) [December 27, 2023] As National File has reported, in addition to Steve Garvey’s alleged draft dodging, a litany of personal scandals are expected the plague his campaign for the US Senate seat vacated by the late Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein – A seat that many believe Republicans are in a unique position to compete for thanks to a jungle primary process and a fractured California Democrat Party. [Read More: Garvey Scandals Could Tank California GOP Hopes in 2024](https://nationalfile.com/garvey-scandals-could-tank-california-gop-hopes-in-2024/) What’s more, Garvey has been slammed by a prominent California conservative insider who says that Garvey’s campaign is meant to get him elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, not the US Senate. As National File reported: Former California Republican Assembly President Stephen Frank blasted Steve Garvey in a write-up published on Frank’s website, [CA Political News and Views], saying that Garvey’s run for the US Senate is actually a campaign for the Baseball Hall of Fame. “STEVE GARVEY STARTING HIS ACTIVE CAMPAIGN – FOR BASEBALL HALL OF FAME,” the write-up’s headline reads. “Even [Garvey’s] ‘campaign’ logo looks like an effort to remind the MLB Veterans Committee to vote him into the Hall of Fame,” Frank wrote, also noting that in a campaign email blasted out last month, Garvey neglected to mention anything he’d actually do as a US Senator.

There are differing reports on the accident, with insidethegames.biz reporting that the 29-year-old was struck by an “unlicensed motorcyclist,” while AgenciaBrasil reports that she was struck by a car. (Based on CNN’s reporting, it would appear that the driver collided with both Baptista and another motorcycle.)\nBaptista’s team said that she had “suffered an accident when she was training on Saturday morning on a road in the district of Santa Eudoxia, in São Paulo,” according to the AgenciaBrasil report. “A car that was coming along the track collided head-on with the bicycle the athlete was riding and the driver fled the scene without providing assistance.”\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ge.globo/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=808b8e4e-73f2-4074-adea-1f8b3b0ea3fa\nBaptista is currently 52nd in the World Triathlon Olympic rankings. In addition to her individual gold medal from the Pan Am Games, Baptista helped the Brazilian team take gold in the mixed relay at the 2019 Games, too. Baptista has also excelled at middle-distance races, taking the win at Ironman 70.3 Pucon in 2022 and finishing eighth at this year’s Professional Triathletes Organization European Open last May.\nThis article originally appeared in\nTriathlon Magazine",

    "text": "\"El poder, al servicio del pueblo\" Programa de Obra Pública es resultado de la austeridad y transparencia: Delfina Gómez Álvarez La gobernadora del Edomex, Delfina Gómez, inicia obras de infraestructura deportiva y vial en Tenango del Valle, Rayón, San Antonio la Isla y Chapultepec Resultado de la política de austeridad que impulsa el gobierno del Estado de México, ahora se destinan recursos de manera transparente al Programa de Obra Pública, lo que permite el desarrollo equitativo de la entidad y el bienestar de las y los mexiquenses, aseguró la gobernadora Delfina Gómez Álvarez. “Estas obras que estamos realizando en todo el territorio estatal son posibles gracias a una política de austeridad y de transparencia con la que trabajamos como gobierno estatal”, indicó Delfina Gómez Álvarez En gira de trabajo por los municipios de Tenango del Valle, Rayón, San Antonio la Isla y Chapultepec, la titular del Ejecutivo estatal dio banderazo de inicio a diversos proyectos del Programa de Obra Pública 2024 integrado por 125 propuestas y una inversión total de mil 500 millones de pesos. “Esta medida de austeridad y manejar los recursos adecuadamente, nos ha permitido liberar recursos que ahora se destinan a la realización de obra pública que beneficia directamente a nuestras comunidades, demostrando con hechos que el poder está al servicio del pueblo”, puntualizó la gobernadora Delfina Gómez Álvarez. Además, dijo que estas obras tienen vocación social y humanista, particularmente los trabajos de rehabilitación de parques y unidades deportivas, que permitirán “tener espacios, no solamente para convivir, sino practicar un deporte, y también fortalecer los valores y lograr la paz mental que tanto nos hace falta como sociedad”, manifestó Delfina Gómez Álvarez. En Tenango del Valle, la mandataria estatal agradeció al gabinete estatal por trabajar con austeridad, señalando que una de las acciones realizadas desde el inicio de su gobierno fue la disminución de salarios en beneficio del pueblo mexiquense. Respecto de las obras, se realizará la rehabilitación del Parque Municipal en Tenango con una inversión de 24.7 millones de pesos, en atención a las necesidades de los 90 mil habitantes de este municipio; además, durante los trabajos de construcción se generarán 928 empleos directos e indirectos. Se remodelará la cancha de futbol rápido, la trotapista, el ciclopuerto, la ciclovía, el módulo sanitario, el área de calistenia, la zona de patinaje y juegos infantiles, las áreas verdes y de mascotas; así como el teatro al aire libre, la construcción de gradas nuevas y un estacionamiento para motocicletas.

Se rehabilitará el pórtico de acceso, las canchas de frontenis, basquetbol y futbol; se construirá un gimnasio al aire libre, un salón de yoga, y dos canchas de pádel. Mediante este proyecto se crearán mil 820 empleos directos e indirectos. Mientras que, en San Antonio la Isla, Delfina Gómez Álvarez anunció la pavimentación de la calle Francisco I. Madero con una inversión de 14 millones de pesos en beneficio de más de 46 mil personas.

    "title": "Obispos españoles expresan su preocupación por el Papa y rezan por su pronta recuperación",
    "text": "Los obispos españoles han expresado su «preocupación» por la salud del Papa Francisco, hospitalizado desde el pasado viernes 14 de febrero tras varios días con una bronquitis, y han renovado este miércoles su petición a los fieles para que recen por su «pronta recuperación».\nEste martes, la Santa Sede informó de que Francisco sufre una «neumonía bilateral» y que presenta un cuadro clínico «complejo». Si bien, esta mañana han comunicado que ha pasado una noche «tranquila» y ha desayunado.\nEl arzobispo de Mérida-Badajoz ha hecho pública este miércoles una nota en la que pide a todos los fieles y a las comunidades oraciones por el Papa Francisco.\n«Oremos por el Pastor Universal de la Iglesia. Hagámoslo en nuestra oración particular, así como en nuestra oración comunitaria, particularmente en nuestras parroquias y comunidades eclesiales, especialmente durante las celebraciones de la Eucaristía», ha pedido.\nPor su parte, el obispo de Ávila, Jesús Rico, ha mostrado su «preocupación» y ha expresado «la cercanía» de toda la diócesis con el Papa Francisco.\nEn efecto, todos los cristianos de Ávila compartimos esa lógica preocupación por el estado de salud del Santo Padre, al que nuestro obispo nos pide acompañar espiritualmente con nuestra oración y nuestro cariño filial», reza el comunicado de la diócesis de Ávila.\nEn este sentido, anima a todos los diocesanos a pedir por «la pronta recuperación del sucesor de Pedro», e invita a todos los sacerdotes a que, «de un modo concreto, en la Misa diaria, realicen una petición por esa intención».\n«Todos los fieles, las familias, las comunidades religiosas, las parroquias, los movimientos eclesiales, estamos llamados a elevar esas oraciones para pedir por la pronta recuperación del Santo Padre, para que pueda seguir guiando a la Iglesia con sabiduría», subraya.\nSe suman así a otros prelados que ya habían pedido oraciones por el Papa, como el obispo de Getafe, Ginés García Beltrán, que pidió que «el Señor le ayude en estos momentos y asista a los médicos que se están haciendo cargo». «¡Santo Padre estamos con usted!», expresó García Beltrán en su cuenta de la red social ‘X’.\nPor su parte, la Archidiócesis de Madrid animó a todos los fieles «a permanecer unidos en la oración»; la Diócesis de Alcalá envió un comunicado en el que reza por el restablecimiento de la salud del Papa y pide a todos los fieles que oren por su recuperación y desde la Archidiócesis de Toledo piden «la intercesión de María» para su curación.\nAdemás, el obispo de Vitoria, Juan Carlos Elizalde, ha animado desde su cuenta de ‘X’ a seguir rezando por el Papa Francisco y desde la Diócesis de Coria-Cáceres han animado a los fieles católicos a permanecer unidos en la oración.\nAsimismo, la diócesis de Almería pide «fortaleza» para que el Pontífice pueda «continuar guiando en la caridad y la comunión» y el obispo de Mallorca anima a la comunidad diocesana, las parroquias, los movimientos católicos y a todos los fieles que recen para «fortalecer el apoyo espiritual al Papa en este momento delicado».\nSegún el Obispado, Francisco ha sido informado de los numerosos mensajes de cercanía y afecto que ha recibido durante estos días de convalecencia y ha pedido que se siga rezando por él.\nLos obispos se suman así desde sus diócesis a la invitación realizada el pasado sábado por la Conferencia Episcopal Española (CEE) a rezar «por el pronto restablecimiento del Papa Francisco» y a hacer una petición expresa en las misas por su salud.",

    "title": "Waubonsee Voices: A gift that keeps giving",
    "text": "Sometimes, the greatest gifts arrive in the most unexpected ways. Recently, I received a message from a former participant of Waubonsee Works, a program funded through the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. The news brought more joy than the most expensive present. “I got the job,” the email exclaimed. While it is exciting news to hear someone received a new position, this email was particularly exciting, as I knew this job would change his life, his family members’ lives, and so many others.\nWaubonsee Works is designed to help participants transition from where they are, to self-sufficiency with a high-wage, high-demand job. As the Waubonsee Works Program Manager, I strive to help students reach that level of success each year. Achieving career goals can feel out of reach, especially for young adults and youth who lack basic skills and face barriers to their employment such as poverty, a disability, justice system involvement, or those who have dependents.\nHowever, this is where the Waubonsee Works Program and WIOA come into play to provide wrap-around services to support these individuals. WIOA-funded programs build bridges to success through funding, training, employer partnerships, and personalized case management. Program participants work with a case advisor to plan their own unique path to success. If the student lacks the skills needed to obtain a high-wage job, WIOA funds can pay for Occupational Training or a Paid Work Experience in industry that will allow them to get those skills and get to work. In addition to these services, WIOA funding provides broad financial support for participants, including tuition and books, transportation costs to get to class or a job site, childcare expenses, utilities, uniforms and tools, and even legal fees. Whatever services a participant needs to help them stay engaged and employed, WIOA has a way.\nFor the participant who emailed me, WIOA funding helped him complete his Associate of Applied Science in Welding and provided meaningful paid work experiences that led to him obtaining full-time employment in his desired industry. While that could have been the successful end to his story, it wasn’t. Before he exited the Waubonsee Works Program, we discussed a road map that would allow him to pursue his passion for teaching. After working for some time in his field, he used his industry hours and paid work experience hours to obtain a Career and Technical Educator license. He applied and was hired as a welding instructor at Indian Valley Vocational Center in\nSandwich. Recently, an adjunct welding position opened at Waubonsee, and I sent him the job posting. He applied and that is when I received the amazing email. He will start working at Waubonsee in the spring of 2024 while continuing his full-time role at IVVC.\nThat is the gift that WIOA gives. This funding opens doors that would otherwise forever remain closed. This funding changes lives and helps put participants on a path to success that continues long after they exit the program, and often, like with my participant, their successes will continue to touch and inspire others in unexpected ways.\n• Jennifer Lara is Waubonsee Works Program Manager at Waubonsee Community College.",
