    "text": "Este 12 de marzo, el Grupo Agroindustrial Riopaila Castilla anunció que recibió la certificación de los primeros 11.524 bonos de carbono generados a partir de un modelo de colaboración con la Fundación Cataruben y Ecopetrol en un proyecto conocido como Orinoco2, en el departamento del Vichada.\nGuillermo Carvajal, gerente de Asuntos Corporativos de la firma, contó más detalles sobre la iniciativa, en la que la empresa estatal de energía se quedaría con los bonos de Riopaila como mecanismo para compensar su huella.\n“Nosotros iniciamos este trabajo a partir de un modelo que hemos desarrollado en colaboración con la Fundación Cataranben y con Ecopetrol, en el que ellos pusieron toda la base científica para la medición. Es como un mecanismo financiero a través del cual se certifican las labores de conservación y esas certificaciones se traducen en unos bonos o créditos de carbono que nosotros los podemos comercializar y adquirir recursos para reinvertir, principalmente, en más programas de este tipo”, introdujo.\nLa empresa logró demostrar, según los datos entregados por la Fundación Cataruben bajo la metodología Gold Standard, que las medidas implementadas en las 1.083 hectáreas de bosque natural, entre los años 2018 y 2022, han aumentado la captura de carbono en más de 300 %.\n“Las acciones de conservación que hemos realizado en efecto han se han traducido en un beneficio ambiental positivo y esto es lo que la metodología de crédito de carbono nos reconoce a través de la emisión de los de los bonos de carbono”, dijo Carvajal.\nRecomendado: Riopaila cerró el 2024 con una facturación de $1,65 billones: ¿Qué viene para 2025?\nEs importante anotar que Riopaila, tiene un amplio espacio para seguir creciendo en términos de certificaciones de conservación, pues el área que se avaló de Orinoco2, solo corresponde al 17 % de las 6.400 hectáreas con las que dispone en el Vichada para estas iniciativas.\n¿Quién se quedará con los bonos de carbón de Riopaila Castilla?\nSi bien los bonos de carbono pueden ser comercializables por Riopaila Castilla tras recibir esta certificación, Carvajal cuenta cómo será la destinación final de este mecanismo.\n“Como parte de la alianza con Ecopetrol, nosotros nos comprometimos a que esos bonos en esta en esta instancia los se los venderíamos a ellos. A Ecopetrol le serviría esto para compensar su huella su huella de carbono y a nosotros nos sirve para que utilicemos esos recursos para la implementación de medidas de compensación ambiental en nuestras operaciones”, afirmó.\nEl gerente de asuntos corporativos de la compañía insistió en el compromiso de la empresa por hacer parte de proyectos cada vez más sostenibles en cada uno de sus proyectos.\n“Dentro de Riopaila tenemos una puesta por las prácticas que llamamos prácticas ASG (ambientales, sociales y de gobernanza) y esto es algo en lo que venimos trabajando para asegurar que, tanto nuestra producción alimentos, como de energía verde y biocombustible sea realizada de la forma más sostenible posible en una agroindustria”, afirmó.\nDentro de los temas la empresa tiene diferentes apuestas y una de ellas es, precisamente, lo que denominan ‘La ruta 2030′ que es el camino para llegar a 2030 con la carbono-neutralidad en sus operaciones.\nEso significa “tener la capacidad de compensar las emisiones y poder terminar en balance cero, por así decirlo, a final de año. Y para eso hemos tenido que implementar una serie de acciones que van desde combustibles, transportes, proveedores, proyectos ambientales que tenemos y debemos implementar, crecer y mejorar”, finalizó.",

    "text": "China's Queqiao 2, or Magpie Bridge 2, relay satellite is ready to provide communication service to missions operating on the Moon's far side, according to the China National Space Administration.\nThe administration said in a press release on Friday morning that the spacecraft has finished in-orbit communication tests. Ground controllers assessed the results and determined that the satellite's framework and mission payloads were running normally. Its capability and performance have proved to be good for signal relay tasks for Chinese and foreign lunar expeditions, the release said.\nQueqiao 2 was lifted atop a Long March 8 carrier rocket from a coastal launchpad at the Wenchang Space Launch Center in China's southernmost island province of Hainan.\nThe spacecraft carried out a series of maneuvers, such as a midcourse trajectory correction and a braking operation, before it entered an elliptical frozen orbit on April 2 to become the world's second relay satellite above the Moon.\nAfter its arrival in the predetermined orbital position, Queqiao 2 conducted two-way communication tests with the Chang'e 4 probe, which is on the lunar far side, and Chang'e 6, which is waiting to be launched at the Wenchang center, to examine its performance. All of the tests were completed before Wednesday, according to the administration.\nCurrently, the satellite is revolving around the Moon about every 24 hours and will soon start relaying signals for the Chang'e 4 and the upcoming Chang'e 6, it noted.\nThe Chang'e 4 probe, which landed in the South Pole-Aitken Basin in January 2019, is the world's first spacecraft that has landed on the Moon's far side, which never faces Earth.\nThe Chang'e 6, if everything goes according to plan, will embark on its journey in coming weeks and touch down in the South Pole-Aitken Basin. It is tasked with collecting dust and rock samples and sending them back to Earth. That will be a groundbreaking endeavor that is challenging, sophisticated and has never been done before.\nCommunication services between the Chang'e 4 and 6 probes and Earth require relay satellites due to their special locations.\nRelated news China's relay satellite Queqiao-2 enters orbit around the moon\n2024-03-25 Rocket sends Queqiao 2 relay satellite to lunar orbit\n2024-03-20 Relay satellite Queqiao plays key role in exploring moon's far side\n2019-01-07",

    "text": "Written by Muhammad Ayman Tuesday, January 2, 2024 04:00 AM\nReceive the company’s\nweather app Apple A major design overhaul, thanks in part to a number of features brought over from the popular weather app Dark Sky, which Apple acquired in 2020, according to macrumors.com.\nThese features made the\nweather app’s interface more detailed and expanded existing sections to include things like Weather maps Precipitation, air pressure and more.\nApple has also redesigned the 10-day\nweather forecast to include more at-a-glance information, and if you’re wondering what the horizontal bars mean, they simply provide a view of the likely temperature range over the course of each day.\nThe longer the horizontal bar for any given day, the greater the temperature change over the 24-day period, and you can get a better idea of this when looking at today’s temperature at the top of a 10-day\nweather forecast. The white dot on the bar is where the temperature fits Current with expected range.\nWhat do the colors of the temperature range mean?\nDark blue: extremely cold (below 0°C)\nLight blue: cool (0°C to 15°C)\nGreen: slightly cool (15°C to 20°C)\nYellow: slightly warm (20°C to 25°C)\nOrange: warm (25°C to 30°C)\nRed: extremely hot (30°C and above)\nA legend for these color codes can also be found when opening the temperature index map for the location.\nIn Apple’s revamped\nWeather app, you can also sign up for next-hour precipitation notifications that will alert you when rain, snow, or hail falls in the next hour at your current location, or at another location you’ve added to the Weather app.",
