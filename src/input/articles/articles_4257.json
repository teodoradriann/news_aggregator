Discover which therapies are expected to grab the major gene therapy in ophthalmology market share @ Gene Therapy in Ophthalmology Market Report\nGene Therapy in Ophthalmology Overview\nGene therapy is becoming a promising solution for retinal degenerative illnesses, particularly due to the retina's suitability for studying and treating eye conditions. Remarkably, it has pioneered approved gene therapy for inherited disorders in the United States, marking a significant advancement in medical treatment. Gene therapy presents a distinctive chance to address and potentially cure retinal degenerative illnesses, bringing optimism to millions impacted by genetic disorders or carrying mutations causing disease. Nevertheless, numerous hurdles must be overcome before gene therapy can be widely accessible for ocular conditions. Key areas such as determining the best timing for intervention, establishing standardized methods for evaluating outcomes, managing inflammation, raising awareness, and ensuring fair access are crucial for progressing treatments for inherited retinal diseases and transforming the outlook for visual impairment.\nGene Therapies in Ophthalmology Epidemiology Segmentation\nIn the US, the highest number of diagnosed prevalent cases comprised of diabetic retinopathy with approximately 5.1 million , while the lowest cases comprised of LHON in 2023.\nIn EU4 and the UK, Germany accounted for the highest number of retinitis pigmentosa-treated cases with approximately 24K in 2020.\nThe gene therapies in ophthalmology market report proffer epidemiological analysis for the study period 2020-2034 in the 7MM segmented into:\nTotal Diagnosed Prevalent Cases of Selected Indications for Gene Therapies in Ophthalmology Eligible Cases of Selected Indications for Gene Therapies Treated Cases of Selected Indications for Gene Therapies Gene Therapies in Ophthalmology Treatment Market\nIn recent years, gene therapy has garnered significant attention in research, especially concerning its application in ocular treatments. The eye is notable among the body's organs as it has gained approval from the FDA for gene therapy, distinguishing it from others in this regard. LUXTURNA , also referred to as voretigene neparvovec-rzyl, is a singular genetic therapy designed to address vision loss caused by a genetic anomaly in both instances of the RPE65 gene. The FDA approved Spark Therapeutics' LUXTURNA in December 2017, while the European Commission (EU) followed suit in November 2018. This authorization extends to all 28 EU member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. The approval of LUXTURNA for individuals diagnosed with inherited retinal dystrophy due to biallelic RPE65 mutations, where there are still functional retinal cells, marks a significant advancement in the progress of ocular gene therapy.\nThe main treatment for AMD and DME entails administering injections of anti-VEGF . Vision decline in both ailments arises from unregulated expansion and fluid seepage of retinal blood vessels. Anti-VEGF treatments work by obstructing the overgrowth of these vessels. Current clinical studies are investigating the potential of introducing genes into retinal cells. This method seeks to prompt cells to independently manufacture anti-VEGF, effectively turning retinal cells into small-scale production units for needed proteins. The overarching goal is to reduce the need for frequent injections during treatment.\nResearchers remain deeply engaged in the field, yet concerns persist regarding potential immune and inflammatory reactions that could undermine the effectiveness or safety of treatments. The eyes, being particularly prone to inflammation, are especially vulnerable to such issues. The severity of these reactions depends largely on the choice of vector and how it is administered. Various preclinical and clinical investigations have highlighted a link between the dosage of the vector and the level of immune response and inflammation in the eye. Moreover, the method of administration directly impacts the intensity of these reactions. For example, subretinal delivery tends to elicit a less pronounced immune response compared to intravitreal injection. Nevertheless, studies have suggested that subretinal delivery may trigger a more vigorous inflammatory response.\nTo know more about gene therapy in ophthalmology, visit @ Gene Therapies in Ophthalmology Analysis\nGene Therapies in Ophthalmology Pipeline Therapies and Key Companies\nBOTARETIGENE SPAROPARVOVEC: JOHNSON & JOHNSON INNOVATIVE MEDICINE /MEIRAGTX AGTC-501: BEACON THERAPEUTICS MCO-010: NANOSCOPE THERAPEUTICS GS030: GENSIGHT BIOLOGICS 4D 125: 4D MOLECULAR THERAPEUTICS CTX PDE6B: COAVE THERAPEUTICS OCU 400: OCUGEN BS01: BIONIC SIGHT LUMEVOQ: GENSIGHT BIOLOGICS NR082 (NFS-01): NEUROPHTH THERAPEUTICS ADVM-022 (AAV.7M8-AFLIBERCEPT): ADVERUM BIOTECHNOLOGIES JNJ-1887 (AAVCAGSCD59/JNJ-81201887): JOHNSON & JOHNSON INNOVATIVE MEDICINE EYS 606: EYEVENSYS 4D 150: 4D MOLECULAR THERAPEUTICS EXG102-031: EXEGENESIS BIO AAV-RPE65: MEIRAGTX/JOHNSON & JOHNSON INNOVATIVE MEDICINE AAV-CNGB3: MEIRAGTX/JOHNSON & JOHNSON INNOVATIVE MEDICINE AAV-CNGA3: MEIRAGTX/JOHNSON & JOHNSON INNOVATIVE MEDICINE NFS-02: NEUROPHTH THERAPEUTICS 4D 110: 4D MOLECULAR THERAPEUTICS ATSN-101: ATSENA THERAPEUTICS ATSN-201: ATSENA THERAPEUTICS OCU410: OCUGEN OCU410ST: OCUGEN AGTC-402: BEACON THERAPEUTICS AGTC-401: BEACON THERAPEUTICS ABBV-RGX-314: ABBVIE/REGENXBIO SKG0106: SKYLINE THERAPEUTICS HG 004: HUIDAGENE THERAPEUTICS OPGX-001: OPUS GENETICS Learn more about the FDA-approved gene therapy in ophthalmology @ Gene Therapies in Ophthalmology Treatment\nGene Therapies in Ophthalmology Market Dynamics\nThe dynamics of gene therapy in ophthalmology market are expected to change in the coming years. AAVs have emerged as the predominant vectors for delivering genes of interest to target tissues with improved specificity, efficiency, and safety , leading companies to offer innovative payment plans for one-time gene therapies, which can enhance the uptake of gene therapies. Additionally, larger firms , leveraging their resources and expertise, have gained an edge in the gene therapy industry by organizing intricate development pathways. The exponential advancements in the field of gene therapy for eye disease over the past few decades hold the potential to treat most eye diseases caused by genetic mutations.\nFurthermore, many potential gene therapies are being investigated, and it is safe to predict that the treatment space will significantly impact gene therapy in ophthalmology market during the forecast period. Moreover, the anticipated introduction of emerging therapies with improved efficacy and a further improvement in the diagnosis rate are expected to drive the growth of gene therapy in ophthalmology market in the 7MM.\nHowever, several factors may impede the growth of gene therapy in ophthalmology market. Even when a rare disease therapy is available, the out-of-pocket cost to patients can be prohibitive, as orphan drugs are priced higher than common treatments to generate sufficient returns on investment despite small patient populations. Simply delivering the product to the desired tissue can be a physical challenge due to the isolated nature of the eyes and the delicate nature of diseased tissue , while gene therapies may face more rivalry for production capacity as more companies join the market, potentially increasing prices or reducing its utility as a treatment choice. A potential crisis with gene therapies for rare disorders is looming in Europe, as many companies have failed to secure reimbursement in the EU and withdrawn the drug after approval.\nMoreover, gene therapy in ophthalmology treatment poses a significant economic burden and disrupts patients' overall well-being and QOL. Furthermore, the gene therapy in the ophthalmology market growth may be offset by failures and discontinuation of emerging therapies , unaffordable pricing , market access and reimbursement issues , and a shortage of healthcare specialists . In addition, the undiagnosed, unreported cases and the unawareness about the disease may also impact gene therapy in ophthalmology market growth.\nOf the target indications, Retinitis Pigmentosa and Wet AMD are anticipated to generate the most revenue by 2034 due to the highest level of clinical development and authorization of gene therapies. Apart from AMD, ocular diseases associated with diabetes may offer the most commercial potential for gene therapy because millions of people with diabetes suffer from ocular issues. Among them include diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema.\nGene Therapies in Ophthalmology Market Report Metrics\nDetails\nStudy Period\n2020-2034\nCoverage\n7MM [the United States, the EU4 (Germany, France, Italy, and Spain), the United Kingdom, and Japan].\nGene Therapy in Ophthalmology Market CAGR\n(2020-2034)\n57.8 %\nGene Therapy in Ophthalmology Market Size in 2020\nUSD 50 Million\nKey Gene Therapy in Ophthalmology Companies\nBEACON THERAPEUTICS, NANOSCOPE THERAPEUTICS, COAVE THERAPEUTICS, BIONIC SIGHT, GENSIGHT BIOLOGICS, ADVERUM BIOTECHNOLOGIES, EYEVENSYS, EXEGENESIS BIO, MEIRAGTX, JOHNSON & JOHNSON INNOVATIVE MEDICINE, NEUROPHTH THERAPEUTICS, 4D MOLECULAR THERAPEUTICS, ATSENA THERAPEUTICS, OCUGEN, ABBVIE, REGENXBIO, SKYLINE THERAPEUTICS, HUIDAGENE THERAPEUTICS, OPUS GENETICS, and others\nKey Pipeline Gene Therapies in Ophthalmology\nBOTARETIGENE SPAROPARVOVEC, AGTC-501, MCO-010, GS030, 4D 125, CTX PDE6B, OCU 400, BS01, LUMEVOQ, NR082 (NFS-01), ADVM-022 (AAV.7M8-AFLIBERCEPT), JNJ-1887 (AAVCAGSCD59/JNJ-81201887), EYS 606, 4D 150, EXG102-031, AAV-RPE65, AAV-CNGB3, NFS-02, 4D 110, ATSN-101, OCU410, OCU410ST, AGTC-401, ABBV-RGX-314, SKG0106, HG 004, OPGX-001, and others\nScope of the Gene Therapies in Ophthalmology Market Report\nTherapeutic Assessment: Gene Therapy in Ophthalmology current marketed and emerging therapies Gene Therapies in Ophthalmology Market Dynamics: Key Market Forecast Assumptions of Emerging Gene Therapy in Ophthalmology Drugs, Conjoint Analysis, and Market Outlook Competitive Intelligence Analysis: SWOT analysis and Market entry strategies Unmet Needs, KOL's views, Analyst's views, Gene Therapy in Ophthalmology Market Access and Reimbursement Discover more about gene therapy in ophthalmology in development @ Gene Therapy in Ophthalmology Clinical Trials\nTable of Contents\n1.\nGene Therapies in Ophthalmology Key Insights\n2.\nGene Therapies in Ophthalmology Report Introduction\n3.\nGene Therapies in Ophthalmology Executive Summary\n4.\nGene Therapies in Ophthalmology Key Events\n5\nGene Therapies in Ophthalmology Epidemiology and Market Forecast Methodology\n6\nGene Therapies In Ophthalmology Market Overview at a Glance in the 7MM\n6.\nGene Therapies in Ophthalmology Disease Background And Overview\n7.\nGene Therapies in Ophthalmology Epidemiology And Patient Population\n8.\nGene Therapies in Ophthalmology Marketed Drugs\n9.\nGene Therapies in Ophthalmology Emerging Drugs\n10.\nGene Therapies in Ophthalmology: 7MM Analysis\n11.\nUnmet Needs\n12.\nSWOT Analysis\n13.\nKOL Views\n14.\nMarket Access and Reimbursement\n15.\nAppendix\n16.\nDelveInsight Capabilities\n17.\nDisclaimer\n18.\nAbout DelveInsight\nRelated Reports\nGene Therapy Competitive Landscape\nGene Therapy Competitive Landscape -

    "text": "By Bill Thornley ,\n16 hours ago\nSPOONER — And now the “dead of winter” is upon us.\nWe got a taste of it recently as late January slapped us in the face with numbing 29-degree-below-zero temperatures. And as January melts into February, we know that there is likely more to come. This is Wisconsin in the winter months.\nBut look around, take a little time to slow down and observe. Mother Nature in January, February and March is far from “dead.” Life goes on even as the harshness of the season makes survival a constant challenge.\nIn nature, winter is a time of survival. But it can also be a time of beauty. Look quickly — a weasel scampers across a frozen pond, his fur as white as the snow, only the black tip of his tail giving him away. He is there for an instant, then he is gone, his tiny tracks in the snow giving the only evidence that he ever was there at all.\nAt the front yard feeder, a cardinal offers a flash of brilliant red against a background of endless white as it drops in for a meal.\nLong ago, the black bear retreated to her den to sit out winter in a kind of pseudo-hibernation. Cold, mild, it doesn’t matter how the winter plays out. She doesn’t have to deal with any of it. And in the blackness of the den, she will give birth to tiny cubs which will sleep with her until spring arrives once more.\nTracks in the snow tell stories of various creatures that have passed by unseen. On a back road, tracks tell the story of a flock of wild turkeys crossing. Snow is brushed away where the birds gobbled up some gravel. Their trail leads into a stand of pines where they flew up to roost.\nAs the day passes, the temperature drops when nightfall arrives. Northern Lights dance across the sky with wave after wave of color. Whites, purples, reds, pinks, greens and blues pulsate and glow dance across the sky, filling the darkness with color before fading away.\nThe night stretches out, bitterly cold with the rising moon casting shadows on the snow. The only sound is the lonely and haunting cry of a barred owl.\nEventually, morning arrives, welcomed by tiny chickadees flitting here and there, eating seeds and dried berries. How do these tiny bundles of energy manage to not only survive the frigid nights but also seem cheerful?\nThe day progresses. Afternoon brings a filtered yellow light and deep blue shadows as the cold hangs on. The rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat of a busy downy woodpecker echoes through the stillness of the woodlands. It is a familiar sound in winter. Trees once loaded with leaves stand naked against the horizon as the final light fades of day fades.\nNight brings a full moon and the temperature plummets as the dead of winter flexes its chilling muscles. Trees pop and thick breath forms frost on the face of the red fox huddled under a blown-down cedar. She is hungry. She found no fat cottontail rabbits or deer mice to feed on. Perhaps tomorrow.\nMorning eventually arrives once more, and life continues in the dead of winter. The chickadee breaks into a happy chirping song, finding birdseed and bread crumbs at a bird feeder. Such feeders keep countless birds going through a hard winter, as well as such species as squirrels and rabbits. In nature, life itself is reason to celebrate. During winter, the celebration is hard and day to day.\nA blue jay puffs itself up against the cold. Nearby, a noisy red squirrel chatters, its tail bobbing as it chews on a small pinecone. A coal-black raven sits high atop a tall oak, giving him a commanding view of all that passes below.\nDays are heavy and dark in the dead of winter. Redpoles, juncos, sparrows, nuthatches and grosbeaks shiver against the wind. Deer move little, conserving their energy. A porcupine nibbles on tree bark high in the branches of a sugar maple. Canada geese swim in a shrinking open stretch of river water.\nMother Nature in January and February can be angry and harsh, like a biting wind roaring across a northern lake. A lonely ice fisherman takes shelter in an ice shack as the wind burns his face and numbs his fingers. The wind passes right through him no matter how warmly he dresses.\nWhen the wind dies down, the harsh land is quiet. The wilderness is bathed in silence, catching its breath. The only sound one might hear is the overhead cackle of the crow as it takes wing, a sound well-known to anybody who has ever shivered on a deer stand.\nSometimes on a winter morning, the sun breaks through, shining brightly. But it offers no warmth to man or nature. The brilliant blue sky highlights the bone-chilling cold below.\nAs winter stretches on, many deer have use up the fat reserves they entered the season with. This is the time when the “dead of winter” can live up to its name. Some will not make it to spring, even during a relatively mild winter. The old and sick and weak will pass.\nYet with the death of some, other creatures will live. The raven will find a meal and survive. So will the porcupine and the mouse who soon come across a downed deer. The coyote, fox and fisher will dine on his flesh. Nature supports itself.\nSeason after season, year after year, life goes on. Mother Nature endures. And somehow, even as we shiver in the cold and snow of January, February and March, we can take comfort in knowing that the “dead of winter” will pass.\n1",

Si un misil tira uno de esos aviones se van a vengar matando a 1000 ciudadanos inoventes de la zona, nosequé del talión y el daño deduplicado lo llaman los pedazo de hijos de puta.\n[#16](c16#c-16) Paciencia, paciencia.\nTodo llega, o acaso crees que esto no les va a explotar en la cara?\nEs cuestion de tiempo\nCuando los sobrevivientes a todo esto, se ultra-radicalicen y eduquen a sus hijos desde el radicalismo, y estos crezcan, ya veras la que se va a armar. Luego Israel llorara porque no se que bebes degollados...\n[#23](c23#c-23) Oh, qué mono y tierno, cuéntanos, ¿Qué tal se siente la ilusión de creer vivir en un mundo donde hay justicia? ¿Reconfortante?\n[#17](c17#c-17) O estoy yo muy desfasado o Irán tenía un programa de desarrollo de armamento nuclear, no armamento nuclear.\nPor otra parte, con USA detrás, Irán y Siria son como dos chistes malos para Israel. Los allanan en dos días los americanos.\nHace mucho de eso pero en la guerra Irán-Irak no estaban a muy distintos niveles e Irak la arrasaron en dos días. Siria porque les echo una mano Putin que si no se la cepillan usando al ISIS (armado por occidente) y poco más.\nCuidado, que la noticia es que cazas israelíes violaron el espacio libanés, y Líbano respondió con misiles... pero lo que cualquiera entendería como una defensa legítima de su espacio aéreo ante una incursión enemiga con nada menos que cazas de combate, como el bueno indudablemente es Israel mejor lo titulamos como que \"Hizbulá dispara misiles contra cazas israelíes\". Y luego por aquello de blanquear y relativizarlo todo un poco más, que es lo que toca cuando los buenos inician el ataque, dentro de la noticia hace referencias al ataque en un marco de \"escalada entre las partes\" y dice que están \"enzarzados en intensos enfrentamientos\".\nComo decía Cañita Brava.... borchenoso.\n[#20](c20#c-20) Alguien me explicará algún día porque merece tantos millones invertidos Israel.\nLo digo porque aunque en EEUU haya mucho judío acaudalado sionista que sea partidario de esta mierda, la cantidad de millones que debe costar no sólo el armamento sino toda la maquinaria propagandística debe ser desorbitante. Enjuagar a tanto periodista a nivel mundial no debe ser barato.\nY sí, los judíos serán muy acaudalados, pero todo tiene sus límites y cuando a un millonario le pides que se rasque el bolsillo más allá de las migajas le suele escocer y se le cura el activismo sionista, nacionalista o lo que sea en un pis pas. Por eso son millonarios, claro.\nLa posición estratégica de las tierras Palestinas puede justificar parte de todo lo que mete USA allí, pero nunca he entendido por qué tanto.\n[#6](c6#c-6) Lo cierto es que esto es peccata minuta comparado con lo de Gaza. Yo si tengo que elegir, elijo que me aterroricen antes que me masacren con bombas, hambre, sed, frío, etc.\nSuma, pero poco. Da más miedo el hecho de que esto tiene visos de ir a más y acabar en guerra. El Líbano debería ir agarrándose los machos.",

    "text": "A Muslim woman in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, faced harassment and humiliation at the hands of her family, religious leader and other co-religionists for putting a saffron stoll over her niqab. She showed up at the police commissioner’s office with a saffron dupatta covering her headscarf and narrated her ordeal in front of the media. She [revealed](https://www.aajtak.in/uttar-pradesh/story/kanpur-women-wear-saffron-colored-hijab-shehar-kazi-got-angry-threatened-woman-met-cm-yogi-lcla-1845225-2023-12-24), “I had gone to meet with the Chief Minister with concerns about harassment and property conflict. However, many people told me that I am now a Hindu and hence as per Sharia, I am not eligible for any assistance going forward.” The victim is from the Moolganj area and notified the chief minister about her predicament on 23rd December while wearing the saffron dupatta. She disclosed that her brothers want to kick her out of the house because of a property dispute. Furthermore, the people in her neighbourhood harass her when she goes out. She complained about it to the authorities in 2022. She then visited CM Yogi after which the cops intervened. The photograph of the encounter became viral creating problems for her. Her brothers stopped feeding her, took all of her belongings including sweaters and blankets and left her to fend for herself in the winter with just her dupatta. She unveiled that she was mocked for wearing the stoll and taunted that she had become like Yogi Adityanath. Her brothers instructed her to go to him because she is Hindu now. They threw her out of the house after assaulting her and she is currently living with her mother. Additionally, everything their father left behind, including the property, cash and jewellery was transferred into their names by her brothers. The city cleric Abdul Quddus Haji initially promised to help her, however, when she called upon him on 29th November 2023, he claimed that she had converted to Hinduism after meeting with the chief minister in saffron. He ordered her to get out of the place. She added, “I told him that I have no resources to manage my expenses according to Sharia Law.” He hurled abuses at her, grabbed a stick and shooed her away when she pleaded for help to survive. Furthermore, the meagre assistance from her brothers was also discontinued. She was supposed to receive Rs 3000 and Rs 2000 from her two brothers respectively along with the fulfillment of her basic requirements like food and clothes. Following the incident, she complained to Jamiat Ulema e Hind’s national president Arshad Madani and protested about the same, but he brushed her off and alleged that the city clergy would take care of this since it was a local problem. She also presented the audio of the conversation to the media. The woman submitted a report to the police commissioner’s staff officer Ashok Kumar Singh who informed that the task of conducting the probe had been entrusted to Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (ADCP) Anita Singh. He proclaimed, “The woman and her brothers are already at odds. She has complained about it many times. The police have registered a First Information Report (FIR) and taken action.” Meanwhile, the cleric has alleged that the accusations against him are false. “How can I even think of such a thing to stop her from going to meet the chief minister,” he asked.",

Los jóvenes no deben ser instrumentalizados para poner en práctica ideas ya decididas por otros o que no responden realmente a sus necesidades. No. Hay que responsabilizar a los jóvenes, implicarlos en el diálogo, en la planificación de actividades, en las decisiones. Debemos hacerles sentir que son parte activa y plena de la vida de la Iglesia; y sobre todo que ellos mismos son los primeros anunciadores del Evangelio a sus coetáneos\", ha señalado.\nDel mismo modo, ha asegurado que el discernimiento es \" un arte que deben aprender en primer lugar los agentes pastorales : sacerdotes y religiosos, catequistas, acompañantes, los propios jóvenes que siguen a otros jóvenes\".\nPara el Papa, es un arte que no se improvisa, \"que hay que profundizar, experimentar y vivir \". \"Para un joven, encontrar a una persona capaz de discernir es encontrar un tesoro. En el camino de la fe y en el descubrimiento de la propia vocación, un guía sabio ayuda a evitar tantos errores, tantas ingenuidades, tantos momentos de desconcierto y de parálisis\", ha señalado.\nEl Pontífice ha lamentado que hoy \" prevalece el individualismo \". \"Cada uno sigue su propio camino, cada uno atribuye sentido a la vida, cada uno establece sus propios valores, sus propias verdades\", ha argumentado.",
