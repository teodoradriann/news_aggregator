    "text": "疥瘡是由一種小蟲「疥蟲」感染引起的皮膚病，常透過密切接觸傳播，尤其在家中、安養院或監所最容易群聚感染。感染後的潛伏期可長達2至6週，一開始沒症狀，但等身體產生過敏反應後，就會開始出現劇烈搔癢，尤其晚上特別嚴重。\n一般疥瘡病人身上可能只有10～15隻蟲，但像這位阿公的「結痂型疥瘡」，身上可能上千隻蟲，不但症狀嚴重，傳染力也非常強。這種病容易和其他皮膚病搞混，所以得靠醫師用皮膚鏡找出蟲隧道，或刮皮膚檢查來確診。\n治療疥瘡得靠外用藥或口服藥來殺蟲，重點是同住家人就算沒症狀也要一起治療，避免持續傳染。衣物、床單、毛巾也都要高溫清洗或封袋放置。北榮皮膚科提醒，如果全家都開始奇癢無比，別再拖了，趕快找皮膚科檢查清楚。\n點擊閱讀下一則新聞\n軍人優先「升等商務艙」4大問題！是否按軍階排序、長短程空位有限",

This led me to believe they wanted to have these things ready for the premiere of Amazon's [amazing](https://www.gamereactor.eu/fallout-season-one-1378413/) Fallout show. It seems like that was the plan, but that they just needed a bit more time. We're [told](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4s2bXQEbpcrsdCZhUYLHAi/fallout-4-is-getting-free-updates) that Fallout 4's free next-gen update will become available on the 25th of April, and that this obviously also means PS5 and Xbox Series versions will launch the same day. These versions of the game will let us choose between a Performance mode with 60 fps and a Quality mode with increased resolution, while offering improved stability improvements and other unspecified fixes. Not that those still enjoying themselves on PS4 or Xbox One have to feel left out, as the last-gen versions will also get a free update on the 25th of April that delivers stability improvements, login and quest fixes. All updates will also include a bunch of free Creation Club items, so I think it's safe to say Fallout 4's [increased popularity leading up to the show](https://www.gamereactor.eu/report-fallout-4-is-becoming-increasingly-popular-as-the-tv-series-approaches-1371553/) was just be beginning. Will you be returning to or finally purchase Fallout 4 now?",

I have heard of your bravery whenever I have gone on review of Naxal operations in these areas,” Shah said.\nSpeaking on the role of the SSB in eliminating terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, the Union Home Minister said, “In Jammu and Kashmir, the SSB has laid down their lives while fighting together with the CRPF, BSF, Jammu and Kashmir Police and the Indian Army against terrorists.”\nAmit Shah said that the government has released a postal stamp to mark the occasion of the 60th Raising Day of SSB.\n“Today on the occasion of the 60th Raising Day of Sashatra Seema Bal, the Government of India also released a postal stamp. It will keep the SSB’s devotion to duty alive in front of the people of the country forever.”\nShah said that the central government has taken several steps for the welfare of all the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) including the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and other organizations.\n“In the last nine years, Prime Minister Modi has taken several steps for the welfare of all the CAPFs, be it CRPF or all the other organizations deployed on the border like the SSB,” Shah said.\nSpeaking about the history of the SSB, Shah said, “The SSB has a rich history of being immersed in the service and protection of our country. After the India-China war, SSB was established in 1963 and after Atal ji (Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee) implemented the policy of ‘One Border One Force’, SSB has been dutifully protecting the India-Nepal border since 2001 and the India-Bhutan border since 2004.”\nThe Union Home Minister attended the 60th Raising Day of Sashatra Seema Bal at SSB Complex in Tezpur along with Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.
