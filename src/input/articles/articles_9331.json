    "text": "Secciones\nServicios\nEl Consistorio de Pilar de la Horadada pretende acometer una serie de obras de mejoras del alumbrado público en varias calles, un proyecto enmarcado en el Plan de Inversiones y Financiación de Infraestructuras de la provincia de Alicante (Planifica). Para ello, ha sacado a licitación un contrato con un presupuesto de 423.207,25 euros (IVA incluido), teniendo un plazo de ejecución de cuatro meses.\nMediante estas actuaciones, el Ayuntamiento busca sustituir las luminarias actuales de vapor socio alta presión por luminarias de mayor rendimiento y eficiencia de tecnología de iluminación led, con varios niveles de reducción de potencia mediante equipos electrónicos con regulación, controlables y programables. El número total de luminarias sustituidas será de 1.318 unidades, correspondiendo 842 unidades al recambio de todo el conjunto de la luminaria y 476 unidades sólo a la lámpara. Las zonas en las que se llevarán a cabo las actuaciones comprenden el sector UE-10, ubicado entre la plaza Nueva y el supermercado Dialprix de la Torre de la Horadada, así como todas las calles pertenecientes a la zona de El Mojón y Las Higuericas. Estos cambios supondrán un 73,57% de ahorro energético en todo el término pilareño, según indican fuentes municipales.\nPublicidad\nPublicidad\nPublicidad\nPublicidad\nEsta funcionalidad es exclusiva para suscriptores.\nReporta un error en esta noticia",

    "text": "2023 Witnessed Continued Attacks on Pro-Life Pregnancy Centers, Churches Attacks continued throughout 2023, with the latest reported act of vandalism occurring this fall at a group of Catholic churches. Pro-life institutions continued to be targets of pro-abortion attacks in 2023 following the landmark Supreme Court decision in June 2022 overturning Roe v. Wade. Roe, the 1973 case that legalized abortion nationwide, was struck down on June 24 — the solemnity of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus — with the decision on the Mississippi abortion case Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. “The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each state from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives,” the majority opinion in the case said. Before Roe’s downfall, news of the imminent Dobbs opinion was [leaked to the media](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251115/supreme-court-will-overturn-roe-v-wade-according-to-draft-opinion). Enraged pro-abortion activists began [targeting Catholic churches](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251169/ruth-sent-us-abortion-group-threat-catholic-masses) as opportunities to disrupt worship. Some [defaced churches](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251185/tabernacle-stolen-catholic-church-defaced-pregnancy-clinic-vandalized) with threatening graffiti, while others disrupted Mass by screaming and [chanting pro-abortion slogans](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251531/nearly-naked-protester-disrupts-mass-in-michigan). Just weeks before Roe’s overturn, an armed California man [was arrested](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251490/armed-man-arrested-supreme-court-justice-brett-kavanaugh-home) near the residence of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh for threatening to kill him. Kavanaugh sided with the majority in the Dobbs decision. Pregnancy resource centers and other pro-life institutions [came under attack](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251174/threats-to-catholic-masses-mothers-day) as well. Some organizations were burned in arson attacks. Others were left threats written in graffiti. Many clinics had their windows smashed. The attacks only got worse once Roe was officially overturned in June, and they continued throughout 2023, with the latest reported act of vandalism occurring this fall at a group of Catholic churches. The Attacks In January, St. Stephen Catholic Church in Riverview, Florida, had a pro-life sign on its grounds vandalized, according to [The Patch](https://patch.com/florida/bloomingdale/fl-church-responds-prayer-abortion-issue-divides-communities). The sign, which said “Abortion stops a beating heart,” was graffitied with the words “Save the pro-choice mom.” That same month, two hooded individuals were caught on camera vandalizing a pro-life pregnancy center in Houston. The leader of the clinic [told CNA](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/253552/leader-of-houston-pro-life-pregnancy-center-says-pro-abortion-vandalism-was-racist) that the vandals wrote “Abortion for all” on the front of the clinic and glued the locks on the entrance of the facility. In March, vandals smashed the windows of First Care pregnancy center in Minneapolis and spray-painted it with graffiti, saying: “If abortions arn’t safe neither r u” and “Jane was here.” “ [Jane’s Revenge](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251518/what-is-janes-revenge-pro-abortion-vandalism),” or iterations of it, such as “Jane was here,” became a calling card of sorts for dozens of pro-abortion vandals after the May 2022 leak from the Supreme Court. One clinic in New York that was spray-painted with “Jane’s Revenge” graffiti in 2022 in an [arson attack](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251477/police-investigation-fire-graffiti-at-upstate-new-york-pro-life-pregnancy-center) was [vandalized](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/253893/ny-pregnancy-center-that-was-set-on-fire-is-hit-again-with-jane-s-revenge-rhetoric) again this past March. The word “liars” was spray-painted in red capital letters across CompassCare’s sign at its 1230 Eggert Road, Amherst, location. The same month police arrested 39-year-old Hannah Kamke in connection with the crime and charged her with one count of criminal mischief in the third degree, which is a Class E felony and holds a [maximum penalty](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/70.00) of up to four years’ imprisonment. Kamke entered a plea agreement and avoided jail time, agreeing to pay $2,580 in restitution, according to [Buffalo News](https://buffalonews.com/news/compasscare-hannah-kamke-vandalization-abortion-clinic/article_e5013582-53f0-11ee-b2f9-ab736913de2d.html). The vandals who set that clinic on fire last year and caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages still have not been identified by police or the FBI, despite the bureau’s offer of a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. The following month, in April, the words “Liars,” “Fake clinic,” “Jane’s Revenge,” “Fund abortion,” and “Abort God,” were scrawled across Bowling Green Pregnancy Center, also known as HerChoice, in Bowling Green, Ohio. Federal charges were filed against a 20-year-old college student in Ohio, Whitney Durant, who goes by the name Soren Monroe, for allegedly vandalizing the clinic. Durant pled guilty this month in federal court to a misdemeanor under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act and faces a maximum of one year in prison. Her sentencing is set for April 9, 2024. The FACE Act [prohibits](https://www.justice.gov/crt/protecting-patients-and-health-care-providers) “violent, threatening, damaging, and obstructive conduct intended to injure, intimidate, or interfere with the right to seek, obtain, or provide reproductive health services.” Durant’s prosecution under the FACE Act is a milestone for the Department of Justice, which has [disproportionately targeted pro-life activists](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/255433/republicans-urge-repeal-of-weaponized-face-act-due-to-anti-pro-life-bias) under the statute. Kristen Clarke, assistant attorney general of the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, said that “defacing facilities that provide reproductive health services will not be tolerated in our society” after Durant’s guilty plea. In the past five months alone, the DOJ [convicted](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/256036/elderly-pro-life-activist-with-significant-medical-issues-convicted-on-face-act-charge) nine pro-life activists under FACE Act charges related to the Oct. 22, 2020, sit-in in which they blocked access to the clinic’s abortion services, according to prosecutors. During the blockade of the clinic, which was livestreamed on Facebook, some of those who sat inside the clinic can be seen praying the rosary and singing hymns to the Blessed Virgin Mary while refusing to leave. The most recent of the nine to be convicted is [Paulette Harlow](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/256036/elderly-pro-life-activist-with-significant-medical-issues-convicted-on-face-act-charge) of Kingston, Massachusetts, 75, who has severe health issues and could face up to 11 years in prison. In May, a Catholic-based clinic, JMJ Pregnancy Center in Orlando, Florida, had three mutilated animals left on its property consisting of a chicken, a large bird, and baby lamb. The director of the clinic [told CNA](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/254329/mutilated-animals-left-on-pro-life-pregnancy-centers-property-in-orlando) at the time that he thought “there was probably some kind of ritual that was involved.” In July, a pregnancy center in Las Vegas was attacked with graffiti that said “Fraud,” among other words, according to [8 News Now](https://www.8newsnow.com/news/local-news/vandals-target-las-vegas-pregnancy-center/). The “a” in fraud was drawn in the shape of an anarchist symbol. In October, there were a series of pro-abortion attacks at Catholic churches in Ohio ahead of the state’s November referendum to enshrine abortion rights into law. That referendum ultimately passed. Churches in Centerville, Cincinnati, Clifton, and Oxford [had signs targeted](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/255889/pro-abortion-vandals-target-ohio-catholic-churches-schools-before-issue-1-vote) that were encouraging Ohioans to vote no on the referendum. Incarnation Catholic Church in Centerville was targeted with graffiti in addition to its signs being vandalized. CNA has [counted](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/251553/map-vandalism-attacks-continue-at-pro-life-centers-across-us) more than 60 pro-life pregnancy centers and almost 40 Catholic churches that have been targeted since the overturning of Roe v. Wade. In January, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a [resolution](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/1233/text) condemning recent attacks on pro-life facilities, groups, and churches. The resolution also called on the Biden administration to use law enforcement to keep the institutions safe. - Keywords: [pro-life pregnancy centers](https://www.ncregister.com/tag/pro-life-pregnancy-centers)",

    "title": "I Am Worried About EA's Skate Revival",
    "text": "If everything that’s planned to release in the next eight months hits its target, 2025 will be one of the best years for skateboarding video games. We already got the skateboarding action roguelite Helskate back in January, with a trio of bangers set to come out in the coming months, including Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 and Skate Story. Arguably, the most exciting skateboarding game slated to release in 2025, though, is Electronic Arts’ and Full Circle’s Skate (stylized “skate.“). Although it is currently just slated for an early access release in 2025, it has already drawn the attention of many skaters and gamers alike.\nVideos by ComicBook.com\nThis is a comeback story 15 years in the making. The last entry in the series was Skate 3 back in 2010. Fans have been clamoring for Skate 4 for years. At one point, there was a fan-led social media campaign that saw almost every comment on EA’s social channels simply say, “Skate 4.” When it was finally revealed that Full Circle, a newly formed team consisting of developers who worked on previous entries, was working on what is now Skate, there was a lot of excitement. It was awesome to see a beloved franchise be revived. However, the more I’ve seen and heard about this entry has me worried that this may not be the revival I was hoping for.\nMy Skate dilemma is partially tied to the gameplay. The first bit of footage from the “Still Working On It” video from 2022 was promising. The animation looks incredible. Specifically, I loved the nollie hardflip down the big drop over the handrail. It’s clear the developers watch a lot of skateboarding and are probably skaters themselves. However, the first signs of trouble were in that video.\nThere is a moment where a huge ramp is shown with players just jumping off of it, some of whom don’t have a board in hand at all. This is followed by footage of a giant human pachinko structure, and a player traversing rafters like its monkey bars at your local playground. I thought this was pretty odd. Some of the first footage shown of the highly anticipated return of the Skate franchise, a series about skateboarding, was players without skateboards jumping off a huge ramp like it was a slide.\nThis may seem like such a small detail to focus on, but it’s one that I think impacts the entire game in a pretty major way. The reason this is so troubling to me is how I, and probably many others, perceive the Skate series. My earliest memory of this franchise was when footage was shown on MTV’s Rob & Big starring former pro skater Rob Dyrdek and the late Christopher Boykin. Before Skate, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater dominated the skateboarding game genre. Although it was loved by thousands of gamers and skaters, even influencing some of today’s pros, Skate promised something different. It promised realism.\nThe first footage showed a skater simply pushing towards a rail, doing a frontside 50-50, and then doing a nollie heelflip through a statue. Compared to Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, this was a much tamer, realistic line, which is indicative of what this series is built on: realistic skateboarding. It’s the reason I gravitated towards Skate. It allowed me to continue the activity I loved doing after a session and portrayed it like the skate videos I watched incessantly at the time (shout out Enjoi’s Bag of Suck and Foundation’s Cataclysmic Abyss).\nAs time went on, players found creative ways to play Skate, resulting in some truly impressive footage that took hours, maybe even days, to get right. Most of these clips are totally unrealistic, with skaters dropping down a 100-foot dam, launching off a ramp, and doing a McTwist through a bridge. It’s pretty sick, honestly. It’s not how I would play, but it’s rad that people can do crazy stunts like this in Skate.\nRELATED: 10 Pro Skaters That Should Be in Skate\nHowever, these crazy stunts were awesome because it felt like people were finding creative ways to interact with what seemed to be a more realistic approach to skateboarding controls. When I played the first Skate demo on Xbox 360, I never once imagined people shooting off a ramp like a rocket, threading every needle they could find, and launching hundreds of feet in the air, only to miraculously land what seems to be a quarter of the map. Seeing how creative people can get with Skate‘s limited controls is indicative of what actual skateboarding is. So, even the most unrealistic line someone did was sick because you knew that was them stretching their creative muscles to figure out how to execute something that seemed impossible.\nThese are the main draws for the Skate franchise. It offered a realistic approach to skateboarding video games when there was nothing like it available at the time, and it allowed players to think creatively when executing a line with its somewhat limited controls. The trailer spotlighting on-foot traversal and parkour mechanics tells me there is a focus on implementing features so any given clip can become viral, like the Steezus Christ memes I see to this day.\nIf there is truly a focus on creating these viral moments in the upcoming Skate game, that is a problem. I like the “Hall of Meat” challenges in the original entries, but potentially having more missions like that would be frustrating and boring. In turn, that would also affect how much players skate, which is incredibly silly to think that a series named Skate would stray away from the actual activity of skateboarding.\nThis could also impact map design. If there is a focus to bring an experience more akin to the popular memes that have floated around in recent years, then that means there would be more obstacles like the Super Ultra Mega Park. Having spots like that is nice in moderation, but if more than 40 or 50 percent of any given zone is like that, it takes away from the core realistic skateboarding experience the series was first known for.\nI do trust Full Circle to create, at the very least, a serviceable gameplay experience with Skate. Even if it were littered with boring challenges, a map of towering mega ramps, and an odd focus on parkour mechanics, if the game is mechanically sound, I do believe the core Skate audience will gravitate to it, especially because it will be free-to-play.\nWhich brings me to how Skate will be monetized. Recently, it was reported that players who partake in the game’s playtest could purchase virtual currency. Since this will be a free-to-play game, it makes sense that there would be some sort of implementation of microtransactions. That is the least surprising thing about this series revival.\nMy concern with microtransactions is more based on what it could potentially offer. It feels like Skate is in a lose/lose situation when it comes to monetization. If they keep all the branded cosmetics behind a paywall, like shoes from Nike or pants from Dickies, I could see a scenario where its audience backlashes. On the flip side, if Full Circle doesn’t populate its digital storefront with content people want to buy, the game’s life is at stake.\nI guess I’m just not sure what Skate can offer to fans as a premium item without there being some sort of negative reaction to it. It doesn’t seem like smaller maps will be on the table, considering the community-driven nature of its gameplay design, where everyone is skating one big city. However, if they were, I don’t see an outcome where people are stoked to purchase extra content, especially since other modern live-service games bring new modes and maps at no additional cost.\nI assume cosmetics will be an item players can spend actual money on in Skate, as just about every live-service game features purchasable cosmetics. Even if Full Circle hides all its branded cosmetics behind a paywall, will players spend tons of money to get every single Girl board, or every Vans shoe? I don’t think so. Personally, beyond a pair of Half Cabs, a certain style of pants, and a board, I don’t see myself spending that much money on cosmetics.\nI don’t see a long future for Skate if this is the main draw for its monetization. It could bundle some of these cosmetics with a Season Pass, which could interest players. But again, if it’s just a bunch of cosmetics, I don’t see how this would get me or anyone else to spend more money beyond the handful of items I’ll probably purchase.\nI really want Skate to succeed. I love skateboarding games, and a win for a big game within that genre means more may come. However, it’s hard to see a scenario where a live-service Skate game meets expectations and sees a fruitful future, especially with how many other live-service games are shut down just months after full release. We’ll just have to wait and see when Full Circle and EA launch the game, which is currently slated to go into early access this year.",

    "title": "Tigo Energy: Pioneering Interoperability to Power the EU Solar Revolution",
    "text": "Tigo Energy: Pioneering Interoperability to Power the EU Solar Revolution\nIn the heart of the European Union's energy transition, where solar adoption faces headwinds from policy shifts and market saturation, Tigo Energy is carving a unique path. By championing interoperability and open architecture, the company is not only accelerating solar deployment but also fortifying its market position in a slowing EU solar sector. For investors, this strategic pivot—from proprietary systems to open, adaptable solutions—presents a compelling case for long-term growth.\nThe Interoperability Imperative\nThe EU solar market, once a beacon of rapid growth, is now grappling with a -1.4% annual contraction in 2025, its first negative growth since 2015. Residential installations have plummeted by over 60% in key markets like Germany and the Netherlands, while corporate PPAs have stalled. Yet, Tigo Energy is bucking the trend. By expanding its inverter compatibility list to include over 50 brands—ranging from Haier Energy to sonnen GmbH—the company is addressing a critical pain point for installers: the need for flexible, modular solutions.\nTake the recent partnership with Haier Energy. By certifying compatibility between Tigo's TS4 Flex MLPE and Haier's hybrid inverters, Tigo enables installers to tailor systems for diverse conditions, from single-phase residential setups to three-phase commercial applications. Federica Cona, Haier's EU product manager, calls this “a game-changer for adaptability,” allowing solar systems to scale without compromising performance. Such collaborations are not just technical achievements—they're strategic moves to democratize solar access in fragmented markets.\nFinancial Resilience in a Challenging Landscape\nTigo's financials underscore this resilience. In Q2 2025, EMEA revenue surged 89.4% year-over-year to $18.3 million, accounting for 76% of total revenue. This growth is driven by the TS4 Flex MLPE, which shipped 646,000 units totaling 477 MW in the quarter. The company's gross margin has climbed to 44.7%, up from 30.4% in Q2 2024, reflecting improved product mix and operational efficiency.\nEven as the EU solar market stalls, Tigo's full-year 2025 revenue guidance has been raised to $100–105 million, with adjusted EBITDA turning positive. This is a stark contrast to the broader industry's struggles. Gal Bauer, Tigo's senior director of validation and product management, emphasizes that “open architecture isn't just a buzzword—it's a business model.” By avoiding vendor lock-in, Tigo is capturing market share in niche segments where larger players falter.\nStrategic Diversification: The Tigo Advantage\nTigo's success lies in its ability to balance innovation with pragmatism. The company's compatibility certifications with sonnenBatterie and Afore, among others, create a “solar-plus-storage” ecosystem that aligns with the EU's REPowerEU goals. These partnerships are not limited to technical integration; they include joint webinars and training programs for installers in high-potential markets like Germany and the Netherlands.\nMoreover, Tigo's geographic diversification—65–75% of revenue now coming from EMEA—buffers it against U.S. market risks, such as tariffs and policy uncertainty. This focus on Europe, where solar is still a cornerstone of the energy transition, positions Tigo to capitalize on long-term demand. Analysts project the company's EMEA revenue could exceed $29 million in Q3 2025, with adjusted EBITDA between $2–4 million.\nInvestment Case: Navigating the Solar Crossroads\nThe EU solar sector stands at a crossroads. While 2025 growth is negative, SolarPower Europe notes that the bloc will still meet its 400 GW target by year-end. However, the 2030 goal of 750 GW remains at risk without policy reforms and grid modernization. Here, Tigo's open architecture strategy becomes a differentiator.\nFor investors, the key question is whether Tigo can maintain its momentum in a fragmented market. The answer lies in its ability to scale interoperability. With thousands of inverter models compatible with its TS4 Flex MLPE, Tigo is not just selling hardware—it's building a platform for the next phase of solar adoption. This platform approach reduces barriers for installers and customers, driving incremental revenue without relying on single markets.\nConclusion: A Solar Enabler in a Shifting Era\nTigo Energy's focus on interoperability and strategic partnerships is more than a response to market conditions—it's a blueprint for the future of solar. As the EU grapples with energy security and decarbonization, companies that offer flexibility, not rigidity, will thrive. Tigo's financial discipline, geographic diversification, and ecosystem-building efforts make it a compelling investment, particularly for those seeking exposure to the energy transition without the volatility of pure-play solar stocks.\nIn a sector where the rules are rapidly rewriting, Tigo is not just adapting—it's leading. For investors, this is a rare opportunity to back a company that's redefining the boundaries of what solar can achieve.\nComments\nNo comments yet",

    "text": "2 weeks ago\nWe have 3 of these throughout our house and one of them (the same one)… randomly goes off, stating fire in the house. It’s not near steam, it’s been cleaned… it just randomly does it. How do I determine if it’s just a faulty product?\nthank you.\na week ago\nHi Kamarantes,\nThank you for posting in the community! I’m sorry to hear that your Nest Protect randomly goes off. No worries. I'd be happy to help.\nTo better assist you, I’d like to ask the following questions:\nTo further assist in diagnosing the situation, I can suggest a safety checkup on your Nest Protect. You can find detailed instructions by checking this article: Learn about Safety Checkup.\nAfter completing the safety checkup, please let me know the following:\nAny additional details you can provide will be helpful.\nBest regards,\nDaniel\nyesterday\nDaniel-I would also appreciate help with this. We have 2 randomly going off and need replacing.\n5 hours ago\nHey DCMath,\nThank you so much for sharing your concerns with me. I understand that you’re facing the same situation with your smoke alarms randomly going off. Let me assist you with further information; it’s a pleasure.\nI appreciate that you have taken action by performing the troubleshooting steps above. I can suggest another step, so try to do a factory reset. For your reference, follow this article: Reset Nest Protect and erase all settings. Then if the situation persists, the team would like to learn more about this behavior. When you get a chance, please fill out this form and let us know when you’re finished. We’ll have someone reach out to you via email from there.\nBest regards,\nDaniel\n2 hours ago\nDaniel - I have filled out the form after doing the factory reset. And we are still having the same issues,\n30m ago\nHello DCMath,\nWe have received the information correctly. Stay tuned; a member of our support team will be in touch over email to help.\nRegards,\nDaniel\n35m ago\nI have 6 protect for about 4 years now. (3 of them have been replaces, 2 under warranty, one went to the bin)\nI had a smoke alarm in the middle of the night again!! its a bug, just a bug, nothing shows up in the logs.\nThe only thing a can conclude is that this message is played together with the BATTERY check.\nI was looking for another brand but fortunantly. the protect is the most capable sensor, slow burning detection, co detection, temperature increase fire detection, night light.\nSo after all, i stick to the protects, BUT i really miss the api to send commands to the rollers to open so we could escape in case of real danger. It would be stupid to have 2 alarms in the only escape way to have one that could send the emergency signal to our home automation system.\nMaybe this all has a bit more side info but in my opinion this really could be a battery check that triggers emergency notifications. The 3 nests that where bought in the same box where a nighmare. 3 fire alarms when not home and 6 false battery check smoke notifications at night.\nAnd then, last but not least... fire is a emergency notification. When i am not at home and one my doors are opening my android receives a notification by using pushover. There i can choose to use the emergency channel for the sound, bypassing the device volume and do not disturb setting. Very handy!\nWhy is google nest not using the google android emergency channel for fire or smoke push message trough the emergency channel?\nWhy not fix these issues and make more people buy these?\nyesterday\nI have the same issue and have previously written about this in another thread that was closed. Can you help me with this too? Except we have 2 nest protects randomly going off after being thoroughly cleaned and batteries replaced.",
