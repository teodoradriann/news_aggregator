    "text": "With the countdown to the consecration of the Ram Temple nearing, the birthplace of Lord Ram Lalla, Ayodhya, is now set to gain international connectivity and a newly revamped railway station that has been rechristened as Ayodhya Dham Railway Station. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will open the railway station and flag off eight trains, as well as the Maharishi Valmiki International Airport on Saturday. He will also review the preparations for the opening ceremony, for which dignitaries from across the globe have been invited. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath reached the holy city on Thursday to assess the preparations for the Prime Minister’s visit, which includes a massive road show on December 30. To enhance accessibility to the upcoming Shri Ram Mandir, the Prime Minister will inaugurate four newly redeveloped, widened, and beautified roads in Ayodhya — Rampath, Bhaktipath, Dharampath, and Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Path. He will lay the foundation stone of a greenfield township being developed at a cost of more than Rs 2,180 crore and the Vashishtha Kunj Residential Scheme to be developed at a cost of about Rs 300 crore. Around 11:15 am on Saturday, the Prime Minister will inaugurate the redeveloped Ayodhya Railway Station and flag off new Amrit Bharat trains and Vande Bharat trains. He will also dedicate several other railway projects to the nation. On the same day, after an hour, the PM will inaugurate the newly built Ayodhya Airport followed by a public programme where he will inaugurate, dedicate to the nation, and lay the foundation stone of multiple development projects worth more than Rs 15,700 crore in the State. These include projects worth about Rs 11,100 crore for the development of Ayodhya and its surrounding areas and projects worth about Rs 4,600 crore related to other projects across Uttar Pradesh. “Prime Minister’s vision is to develop modern world-class infrastructure in Ayodhya, improve connectivity, and revamp its civic facilities while also conforming to the rich history and heritage of the city. In realisation of this vision, a new airport, a newly redeveloped railway station, newly redeveloped, widened, and beautified roads, and other civic infrastructure are being inaugurated in the city. Further, foundation stones of a number of new projects will be laid that will contribute to the beautification and revamp of civic facilities in and around Ayodhya,” said a senior government official. The Phase-I of the state-of-the-art airport has been developed at a cost of more than Rs 1,450 crore. The airport’s terminal building will have an area of 6,500 sqm, equipped to serve about 10 lakh passengers annually. The facade of the Terminal Building depicts the temple architecture of the upcoming Shri Ram Mandir of Ayodhya. The interiors of the terminal building are decorated with local art, paintings and murals depicting the life of Bhagwan Shri Ram. The terminal building of Ayodhya airport is also equipped with various sustainability features like an insulated roofing system, LED lighting, rainwater harvesting, landscaping with fountains, water treatment plant, sewage treatment plant, solar power plant, and many other such features have been provided to meet GRIHA 5 star ratings. “The airport will improve connectivity in the region, leading to a boost in tourism, business activities, and employment opportunities,” added the official. The redeveloped Ayodhya Railway Station, now known as Ayodhya Dham Junction Railway Station, has been developed at a cost of more than Rs 240 crore. The three-storey modern railway station building is equipped with all modern features such as lifts, escalators, food plazas, shops for puja needs, cloakrooms, and waiting halls. The station building will be accessible for all and IGBC certified green station building. The programme at Ayodhya Dham Junction Railway Station will witness the Prime Minister flagging off a new category of superfast passenger trains in the country — the Amrit Bharat Express. The Amrit Bharat train is an LHB push-pull train with non-air-conditioned coaches. This train has locos at both ends for better acceleration. It provides improved facilities for rail passengers such as beautifully designed and attractive seats, better luggage racks, mobile charging points with suitable mobile holders, LED lights, CCTV, public information systems, among others. The Prime Minister will flag off two new Amrit Bharat trains: Darbhanga-Ayodhya-Anand Vihar Terminal Amrit Bharat Express and Malda Town-Sir M. Visvesvaraya Terminus (Bengaluru) Amrit Bharat Express. Modi will also flag off six new Vande Bharat Trains, including Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Katra-New Delhi Vande Bharat Express; Amritsar-Delhi Vande Bharat Express; Coimbatore-Bangalore Cantt Vande Bharat Express; Mangalore-Madgaon Vande Bharat Express; Jalna-Mumbai Vande Bharat Express; and Ayodhya-Anand Vihar Terminal Vande Bharat Express. The Prime Minister will also dedicate to the nation three railway projects worth Rs 2300 crore to strengthen rail infrastructure in the region. The projects include the Rooma Chakeri-Chanderi third line project; Jaunpur-Tulsi Nagar, Akbarpur-Ayodhya, Sohawal-Patranga, and Safdarganj-Rasauli sections of the Jaunpur-Ayodhya-Barabanki doubling project; and the doubling and electrification project of the Malhaur-Daliganj railway section. Modi will also inaugurate and dedicate to the nation a number of projects that will strengthen civic infrastructure and beautify public places in and around Ayodhya. These inaugurated projects include Rajarshi Dashrath Autonomous State Medical College; a four-lane road connecting Ayodhya-Sultanpur Road-Airport; a four-lane road to Tedhi Bazaar Shri Ram Janmabhoomi via NH-27 bypass Mahobra Bazaar; several beautified roads across the city and the Ayodhya bypass; the Jagdishpur-Faizabad section of NH-330A; widening and strengthening of the Maholi-Baragaon-Deodhi road and Jasarpur-Bhaupur-Gangaraman-Sureshnagar road; an ROB at Badi Bua Railway Crossing on Panchkosi Parikrama Marg; a solid waste treatment plant in the village Pikhrauli; and new buildings and classrooms in Dr. Brajkishore Homoeopathic College and Hospital, among others. The Prime Minister will also inaugurate works related to Mukhyamantri Nagar Srijan Yojana work and five parking and commercial facilities. Additionally, he will lay the foundation stone of new projects that will further help in the revamp of civic facilities in Ayodhya while also strengthening the rich cultural heritage of the city.

    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) Friends and family mourn the loss of Canadians killed by Hamas in Israel Friends, family and government officials have confirmed that at least seven Canadians were killed when Hamas militants conducted a series of attacks in Israel on Oct. 7. Global Affairs Canada has said an eighth person who was not a citizen but had deep ties to Canada also died in the ensuing conflict. Another Canadian, who has not been identified, died in Lebanon during the hostilities. The Hamas attacks killed an estimated 1,200 people and militants took another 240 hostage, 105 of whom were released during a temporary pause in the violence at the end of last month. As Israel continues its retaliation on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, authorities there say more than 20,000 Palestinians have now been killed. Here's what we know about the Hamas victims with ties to Canada: Judih Weinstein Haggai Judih Weinstein Haggai, 70, was out on an early-morning walk when Hamas started its attack, her family says. She told members of her Nir Oz kibbutz that a militant on a motorcycle shot her husband and she was less severely wounded. The community was unable to dispatch an ambulance before militants arrived there. Last week, the kibbutz confirmed Gadi Haggai, Judih's husband, died on Oct. 7, and on Thursday they confirmed Weinstein Haggai also died that day, and her body is being held in Gaza. Weinstein Haggai was born in New York state but arrived in Toronto at the age of three, and moved to Israel 20 years later to live with her husband. She held Canadian, Israeli and American citizenships. Weinstein Haggai was an artist and a volunteer who the kibbutz said \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\" Her brother Larry Weinstein said the family is distressed by Israel's offensive in Gaza and the rise of hateful speech in Canada toward both Jews and Muslims. \"We're inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,\" he said. \"There can't be any kind of resolution when people are at each other's throats.\" Vivian Silver Vivian Silver, 74, was in her home on Kibbutz Be'eri near the Gaza border and talking on the phone with her son Yonatan Zeigen when they learned of the incursion by Hamas into Israel. \"We couldn’t grasp the incapability of the Israeli army to defend the civilians … we started to say goodbye because we realized this is probably our last words to each other,\" Zeigen later told a news conference organized by the Jerusalem Press Club. He said they shifted their conversations to text messages so his mother could stay silent, and someone broke into her home. They said they loved one another before the messages stopped coming. Zeigen said he had received information that she was taken hostage, and her phone had been geolocated in Gaza. On Monday, his brother Chen Zeigen confirmed their mother's death. He said Israeli authorities told him the remains found earlier in the kibbutz had been identified as Silver. He said his mother was born in Winnipeg and moved to Israel in 1974. She dedicated her life to peacebuilding and fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, he added. She also volunteered to help children in Gaza access medical care in Israel. Tiferet Lapidot Tiferet Lapidot, 22, was a few days shy of her 23rd birthday and attending a music festival when the Hamas attack began. Her cousin Oran Zlotnik remembered Lapidot as a charismatic and compassionate person who had travelled the world, taught in Africa and spent time in Australia before she returned to Israel in the fall. Her uncle Harel Lapidot said she called her mother the morning of the attack to say she was hiding in a bush and to ask whether she should flee. Her cellphone was later tracked to the Gaza Strip, leading family to believe she was being held hostage. They then mounted a campaign to secure her freedom. Zlotnik said that when the cellphone of one of Lapidot's friends, confirmed deceased, was also traced to Gaza, the family realized it was possible she wasn't a hostage. Harel Lapidot said his niece's body was later identified and the family held a funeral. \"We know for a fact they were hunted,\" he said. \"They ran away and they were hunted and killed.\" Tiferet Lapidot was an Israeli citizen but her family was from Canada, including her father, Ohad, who was born in Saskatchewan. Harel Lapidot thanked the Jewish community in Canada and MPs who had reached out to help and offer support. The family had a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly while she was in Israel. Netta Epstein Israeli-Canadian Netta Epstein, 21, died when his home, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, came under attack. His mother, Ayelet Shachar-Epstein, said he loved life. She learned the circumstances of his death from text messages he sent her in the moments before he was killed, and from his fiancée, Irene Shavit, who survived. Netta Epstein was inside a safe room with Shavit, and he jumped on a grenade thrown in by the attackers. Shachar-Epstein, who also lost her mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law in the attacks, described it as a terrorist invasion. She said her son, who had worked with special needs youth, had returned home two months earlier after completing military service. He was born in Montreal and was a Canadian citizen. Shachar-Epstein said many members of the family still live in that city. Shir Georgy Israeli Canadian Shir Georgy, 22, was killed by Hamas militants who ambushed the music festival near Kibbutz Re'im. Georgy's aunt Michal Bouganim confirmed the death. \"We are currently a mess, heartbroken,\" Bouganim said in a Facebook message. Bouganim shared a 22-second clip on her social media in which a terrified Georgy was seen sitting on a floor, with her back against a wall and surrounded by other festival attendees — some of them injured. Georgy's funeral was held in Israel. Adi Vital-Kaploun Adi Vital-Kaploun, 33, was killed by Hamas militants in her kibbutz near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, said the Jewish Federation of Ottawa. The group's CEO made a statement on behalf of Vital-Kaploun's family, saying the dual citizen has a large extended family in the Ottawa area. The family said she died a hero, after convincing her killers to spare her two young children and warning her father and husband to stay hidden during the attack. \"Adi was a beautiful woman that brought love and lightness to the people around her, but also she was very focused and determined to make a beautiful life for her family,\" her cousin-in-law Aaron Smith said in an interview. The family said she was an amazing mother and wife, always bringing love and laughter to their household. She was also a talented dancer, saxophonist and basketball player. After completing her master's degree in engineering, Vital-Kaploun excelled in her cybersecurity career, they said. \"We are mourning trying to process this unconscionable act of terrorism in her kibbutz and across the country,\" said the family, adding that they wish her memory to be \"a blessing.\" Ben Mizrachi Canadian Ben Mizrachi was one of at least 260 people gunned down by Hamas militants at the music festival in southern Israel. Mizrachi, 22, from Vancouver, was described as \"larger than life with a big personality\" in a statement by his former high school in B.C. Ezra Shanken, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, said Mizrachi was about to start university in Israel after serving with the country's national defence force. Hilit Nurick, a home economics teacher at King David High School in Vancouver, remembered Mizrachi as a \"kind, wonderful, and community-minded\" young man who had a positive influence on everyone around him. Nurick said she and Mizrachi once put a large event together for more than 100 people at school. \"He was in charge of making Moroccan-style spicy fish stew. He brought his mother's recipe and shared it with everyone and taught us how to make it,\" said Nurick. \"He was incredible, just an incredible human being.\" Alexandre Look Alexandre Look, who had recently celebrated his 33rd birthday, was among those killed while attending the musical festival. Look, who lived in Montreal with his family before moving to Mexico, died a hero, his dad said in a Facebook post. \"Like a true warrior he left as a hero wanting to protect the people he was with,\" Alain Haim Look said. Friend Lior Horovitz described him as a \"once-in-a-lifetime person\" who became like family during their five-year friendship. In a phone interview from a town outside Tel Aviv, she said she and her boyfriend met Alexandre Look in Mexico. They became fast friends and would organize their vacations to meet up, either in Mexico or Israel. He was a proud Jewish Canadian and a generous person who would do anything for his friends, she said. \"He's a person who loves people,\" she said. \"He's the guy that's always going to help others, especially if they are Jewish.\" [Shopping Trends](https://www.ctvnews.ca/shopping.html) The Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

    "text": "Most Quokkas Live At This One Spot In The World\nQuokkas, referred to as \"the happiest animal in the world,\" are known for their photogenic qualities. In fact, celebrities like actor Chris Hemsworth and pop singer Shawn Mendes have gone viral for posting selfies with the marsupial. These photos have something else in common; they were taken on the quokkas' native home, Rottnest Island.\nLocated in Western Australia on the Indian Ocean, Rottnest Island is only about 20 miles off the coast of Perth, Western Australia's capital. Although it's a popular vacation destination for locals, it's sparsely populated by humans. Nevertheless, the same can't be said about quokkas. While quokkas inhabit other parts of Western Australia,\nRottnest Island states that they have the largest quokkas population in the world. According to a 2023 article from the Sydney Morning Herald, up to 12,000 Quokas are on the island. That said, Quokkas inspired Rottnest Island's name.\nThe Aboriginal Whadjuk Noongar people originally inhabited the island. However, in 1696 (via\nhttps://www.rottnestisland.com/learn/military-maritime-history), Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh became one of the first Europeans to arrive on the island. He encountered quokkas and believed them to be rats. Thus, the island became known as Rottnest, which translates into \"rats nest.\" If you visit Rottnest Island, you can get up close and personal with the animals, with some exceptions.\nWhere to find quokkas on Rottnest Island\nThere's a reason why quokkas, considered a vulnerable species, have a burgeoning population on Rottnest Island. The small island is highly focused on preservation, and most motorized vehicles are prohibited. In other words, the quokkas' natural environment is largely undisturbed. In addition, domestic animals are banned from the island. As such, quokkas do not have to worry about becoming prey.\nWith this in mind, Rottnest Island has various regions where the animals are regularly seen. This includes bike paths, Thomson Bay, the area surrounding Garden Lake, the Ngank Yira Bidi trail, and more. If tourists prefer a guide to show them Rottnest Island's quokkas hotspots, they can book a 30-minute \"Meet the Quokkas\" tour. The Rottnest Voluntary Guides Association (RVGA) provides this walking tour daily. The tour starts in Thomson Bay near the RVGA's information booth and the Island Gypsy gift shop. While taking photos with the quokkas is encouraged, there are guidelines and words of advice that visitors should take to heart before they pull out their cameras.\nNo matter how cute they appear, you should not touch or feed quokkas; this can harm them, and the herbivores do bite. Experts like Rottnest Island's General Manager of Environment, Holly Knight (via\nWestern Australia), say that if you stick around one place, the animals will eventually get close to you, allowing you to take a selfie. Knight also noted that you're more likely to encounter the animals in the evening.\nThere's more to discover on Rottnest Island\nQuokkas may be one of Rottnest Island's defining features, but it's far from its only highlight. Rottnest Island is one of\nAustralia's top island getaways. Visitors can take the Rottnest Express from Perth or the nearby city of Fremantle and be on Rottnest Island in under two hours. The ferry departs daily, and a roundtrip ticket starts at under $50 at the time of this writing. The Rottnest Express disembarks near the Rottnest Island Visitor Center in Thomson Bay.\nBesides seeing quokkas, visitors are treated to various wondrous beaches, including Pinky Beach and The Basin (pictured). Per Tripadvisor, the latter is prevalent among swimmers and is renowned as a prime example of\nAustralia's natural beauty. The Basin is also a go-to snorkeling spot and is a 20-minute walk or a four-minute bike ride from Thomson Bay. Since no cars are on Rottnest Island, biking is the perfect way to discover the island. Bike paths are found throughout and can swiftly get you from one location to another. You can rent a bike, snorkel gear, and more at Pedal & Flipper Hire, located minutes from the Rottnest Island Visitor Center.\nA day trip to Rottnest Island is attainable. However, those wanting to stay in paradise overnight can do so at Discovery Parks. The resort, located close to The Basin, does not offer rooms but rather luxury tents. Prices start at over $500 a night.",
