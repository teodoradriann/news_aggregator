    "text": "The Gemini solar and storage project, the U.S.’ largest co-located solar plus battery energy storage system (BESS), is now fully operational, Gemini’s developers [Primergy Solar](https://www.hartenergy.com/companies/primergy-solar) and Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners announced July 18. Located in Clark County, Nevada, the project includes 1.8 million solar panels that can generate up to 690 megawatts (MW), powering approximately 10% of the state’s peak power demand. The solar panels are co-located with 380 MW of four-hour battery storage to provide Nevada with 1,400 megawatt-hours of clean energy after sundown, the companies said in its release. Gemini incorporates a DC-coupled storage configuration which enables the BESS to charge directly from the solar panels. This allows for increased efficiency and maximizes the capture and storage of solar energy directly on-site, the release said. In April 2022, Primergy and Quinbrook closed a $1.9 billion debt and equity financing for Gemini’s construction and development. In October 2022, APG, a Netherlands-based pension asset manager, acquired a 49% equity ownership in Gemini on behalf of its pension fund client ABP. In April 2024, the remaining 51% of the project was acquired by the Quinbrook Valley of Fire Fund, with Blackstone Strategic Partners and Ares Management Infrastructure Secondaries funds as lead investors. “Gemini broke the mold with a historic amount of solar and BESS, backed by the largest tax equity financing of its kind,” said Primergy CEO Ty Daul. “Achieving full commercial operations marks a significant technical and financial milestone for our team. We successfully navigated challenging supply chain and inflation issues through proactive planning and collaboration to bring this project online.” Earlier this year, Primergy closed commitments for $588 million in debt financing for the 408 MW alternating current Ash Creek Solar project in Hill County, Texas. The company also signed a long-term power purchase agreement with Microsoft for the full capacity of the plant.

    "text": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (Dakota News Now) - Sioux Falls Animal Control needed the assistance of Sioux Falls Fire Rescue on Thursday to save a pig and the video has gained traction on social media.\nThe pig has been through a lot, but is in good hands after being spotted on the sandbar of the Big Sioux River,\nThe rescue was quick, but now there are more questions to be answered like how and why the pig was there and where it came from.\nJust north of Falls Park, a peculiar scene unfolded as a young livestock pig was spotted not too far from the dangerous rushing water from the falls.\n“We get a lot of different calls, so you never know until you get there, and when I drove up, I saw a little pig running down the sandbar so I knew it was true,” said Sioux Falls Animal Control Supervisor Patty Beckman.\nSioux Falls Fire Rescue assisted Animal Control and shared footage to social media that showed not a wild goose chase, but them chasing the stranded swine.\n“We appreciate the Fire Department so much. They help us out with so much stuff that we have, whether it’s a water rescue or if they have to help us get an animal out of a tree. We appreciate their assistance so much and we value their teamwork with us,” Beckman expressed.\nIt’s rare for Sioux Falls Animal Control to encounter a stray pig, but the circumstances made it an even stranger situation. No one knows why the pig made its way to that sandbar and where it came from is anyone’s guess.\n“At this point in time, we really don’t know where the pig came from. We did get in contact with Smithfield, but they stated that they don’t take pigs that small. So at this point, we really have no clue,” Beckman said.\nDana Konzem with the Sioux Falls Area Humane Society said that she first heard about the situation from the video on Facebook. They knew the pig would arrive soon after.\nHe will be housed at the Humane Society for now, but it’s not normal for them to see a pig, either. Owning a pig as a pet is not allowed within Sioux Falls city limits.\n“It’s pretty rare for a pig to come in as a stray animal, maybe one every five to seven years that we get something like this. Typically if a pig is a stray animal, we know where it came from, someone’s out looking for it,” Konzem said.\nAfter a stressful 24 hours, this mystery pig is resting and receiving the care it needs.\n“It’s just a little bit of a different animal to take care of. Hopefully, we can get it back to its rightful owner or get it into a forever home once its stray wait is up,” Konzem said.\nThe pig, to be named later, will stay at the Humane Society until someone claims him or the 72-hour stray hold period is over. After that, he would be sent to a new, loving home. The Humane Society cannot adopt out a pig, so he will likely go to an animal sanctuary.\nCopyright 2024 Dakota News Now. All rights reserved.",

Despite a challenging situation, the hosts, Daryl Mitchell and Glenn Phillips, rescued their team, securing victory with 11 balls to spare.\nHaving been asked to bat first, Pakistan posted a total of 158/5 in 20 overs. Rizwan's dazzling 63-ball 90 and a quick cameo of 21* runs by Mohammad Nawaz contributed to a respectable score. However, Pakistan's middle-order struggled to accelerate, going almost seven overs without a boundary after the powerplay. Matt Henry and Lockie Ferguson claimed two wickets each for the Black Caps, while Adam Milne secured one.\nChasing 158, New Zealand faced an early setback, losing three wickets quickly and finding themselves at 20/3 in the third over. Finn Allen, Tim Seifert, and Will Young fell victim to Pakistani skipper Shaheen Afridi. Daryl Mitchell and Glenn Phillips initiated a rescue mission, displaying sensible play to maintain a steady scoring rate and accelerating when necessary. Despite Pakistan's efforts, the bowlers couldn't break the partnership. The duo's unbeaten 139-run stand led New Zealand to victory by 7 wickets with 11 balls to spare. Mitchell concluded with an unbeaten 44-ball 72, while Phillips remained unbeaten with a 52-ball 70.\nShaheen Afridi stood out with the ball for Pakistan, claiming all three wickets that fell during the innings.\nAlso Read: Sachin Tendulkar's all-round performance steals the show in Bangalore (WATCH)",
