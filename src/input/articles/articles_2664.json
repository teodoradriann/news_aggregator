    "title": "Young UAE-based Climate Tech Angel Investors favor African and MENA regions",
    "text": "UAE-based investors are using the MENA region as a base to provide sustainability solutions across the India China Africa corridor , according to the annual Angel Rising Investor Trends Report from startAD and VentureSouq The average age of participants is younger than their global counterparts and features a higher female ratio Abu Dhabi, UAE : Angel investors based in the UAE with a focus on climate tech are more likely to favor Africa and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) over the more established US, Asian, and European markets, according to the Investor Trends Report 2023 . The report was produced by startAD, the Abu Dhabi-based startup accelerator powered by Tamkeen and anchored at NYU Abu Dhabi (NYUAD), and MENA-based venture capital firm VentureSouq.\nAccording to the report’s survey, the top three leading geographies for climate-related investment by UAE-based investors are Africa (23 percent), MENA (19 percent), and Asia (15 percent). In contrast, the majority of global climate tech venture capital goes to the US (around 40 percent), followed by China (around 22 percent) and Europe (around 20 percent). The MENA region is the fourth-largest market, accounting for about 1.5-3 percent of global climate tech venture capital, while Africa is in fifth place at about 1-2 percent.\nMeanwhile, the male-to-female investor ratio of 57 percent to 43 percent compares favorably with international averages. In the US, 22 percent of angel investors are female, while in the UK, it is 14 percent. At 42, the average age is also substantially younger than the 57.6 years old mean age of angel investors surveyed in the US, while the UK average is 55 years old.\nManaging Director of startAD Ramesh Jagannathan said: “Our Investor Trends Report reveals a young generation of savvy climate tech investors who are using the UAE as a base to serve the vast markets on our doorstep. The global consumer class is set to reach 5.2 billion people by 2030, of which over three billion will be in India, China, and Africa. The Mena region, led by the UAE, is at the nexus of this ‘ICA Corridor’, with Africa arguably ranking as the biggest potential growth story of the coming decades. A recent IEA report notes that Africa attracts just three percent of global energy investment yet accounts for one-fifth of the global population, while energy investment across the continent must double to over USD 200 billion per year by 2030 to achieve their energy-related development goals. Furthermore, a UN report highlighted the potential for African countries to leapfrog previous innovations using frontier technologies, helping them quickly advance to a more sustainable, equitable and profitable future. This potential can be further unlocked by the UAE’s pledge of USD 4.5 billion to help speed up the development of clean energy projects in Africa, announced at COP28.”\nHead of Public Affairs and Outreach at the US Consulate Daleya Uddin : “The US Mission to the UAE is proud of its partnership with NYUAD-based startAD and VentureSouq to promote awareness and encourage investments in the Climate Tech startup ecosystem in the MENA region. The Department of State’s Office of Global Partnership, in collaboration with founding and future partners of the Coalition for Climate Entrepreneurship (CCE) partnership, held a regional pitch competition in the US Center during COP28 to showcase women climate entrepreneurs with early-stage solutions ready to scale. The event was an avenue to highlight climate entrepreneurs as well as to showcase our commitment to identifying and implementing climate solutions. At COP28, Vice President Kamala Harris pledged an additional USD three billion to the Green Climate Fund. We are encouraged by the 2023 Angel Rising Investor Trends Report’s finding of increased investor interest in sustainability solutions.”\nManaging Director of The Catalyst Suleiman Amin said: “This year’s Angel Rising event was a nexus where investment meets innovation, creating a ripple effect that transcends borders and accelerates the adoption of climate-tech for a sustainable future. The Global South is not just a developing region; it's a powerhouse of ideas. By collaborating and channeling resources strategically, we can unlock the true potential of climate-tech innovation together.”\nAs well as being more open to emerging market potential, the report revealed some other key differences between UAE-based angel investors and their global counterparts:\nThe younger age profile of investors is reflected in the highest average number of investments, which is one to three (42 percent) followed by five to 10 (26 percent) and then 20+ (20 percent). These figures suggest that investing is a relatively new venture for most respondents, reflected in their age profile. This relative in-experience and youth is not necessarily reflected in the ticket sizes. The highest average is USD 100,001+ (44 percent) followed by USD 1-50,000 (29 percent) and USD 50,001-100,000 (21 percent). The median investment by angel investors in Europe is around USD 38,000 and USD 25,000 in the US. These numbers are reflected in the Asian region but with a broader range of tickets from USD 25,000 to USD 200,000.\nThe leading sectors for investment this year are roughly tied between cleantech (11 percent), AgTech (11 percent) and environmental tech (10 percent). This is a marked change from 2022 where foodtech came out on top (11 percent) followed by AgTech (10 percent), and ecommerce (9 percent), which this year fell to tenth place, perhaps reflecting the shift away in preoccupation from online innovation in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Angel Rising Investor Trends Report 2023 is based on responses from 91 investors who took part in the annual Angel Rising summit last December. Aligned with the UAE’s ambitions to achieve net-zero carbon emission by 2050, the eighth annual edition of Angel Rising was organized in partnership with The US Mission to the UAE and The Catalyst to support and invest in clean-tech startups that are creating and scaling solutions to address climate change.\nAngel Rising is targeted towards GCC-based family office funds, venture capitalists, angel investors, institutional investors, corporate and government investors, and stakeholders who are interested in investing in impact-driven technology startups that can bring positive change in the future of climate and the economy.\nOver seven years, Angel Rising has convened 110 global experts, 3,100 participants, and reached 12 million people worldwide. Ecosystem partners for this edition include The UAE Independent Climate Change Accelerators and the European Women’s Association.\nFor more information, please visit startad.ae/programs/angel-rising/ .\nAbout startAD\nstartAD is an Abu Dhabi-based accelerator, steering local and global startups to scale in the UAE and beyond.

Forecasts on Thursday were calling for a high of 88 degrees in Dutchess County on Saturday, with heat index values - the so-called \"feels like\" temperature - being as high as 96.\nElsewhere, high temperatures will be in the mid-80s in Orange and Ulster counties, and the low 80s in Sullivan County, on Saturday.\nForecasts in all four counties call for chances of rain, and possibly thunderstorms, periodically throughout the day,\nRainfall amounts will range from one-tenth to one-quarter of an inch in Orange and Ulster counties, to one-quarter to one-half of an inch of rain in Sullivan and Dutchess counties.\nTerroristic threat: Esopus man accused of threatening to blow up an Ulster County building\nHigher amounts than those forecast are always possible in thunderstorms, the National Weather Service says.\nOn Sunday, there again will be chances for showers and possibly a thunderstorm.

    "text": "Six months after HyLife shut down, former workers hope for ‘better life’ if plant re-opens\nIt’s been about six months since the HyLife pork processing plant in Windom closed. More than 1,000 people lost their jobs. That’s about 20 percent of the southwestern Minnesota town’s population.\nThe closure came as Premium Iowa Pork bought the plant in June. Now many of the former HyLife workers are hanging their hopes and futures on the plant reopening this spring.\nIn her Windom home. Maria Fernanda Morales Martinez, 22, made herself a snack in her small kitchen. She poured herself some cereal and rummaged in her cabinets for some utensils.\nThe former HyLife worker has been out of work for six months, struggling to make ends meet. She was one of about 500 workers on visas specifically tied to employment at HyLife. Under H-2B regulations, those workers had to leave the United States quickly if their jobs were terminated.\nGrow the Future of Public Media\nMPR News is supported by Members. Gifts from individuals power everything you find here. Make a gift of any amount today to become a Member!\nHowever,\n[due to a state investigation into possible wage and hour violations at HyLife], some workers including Martinez were able to apply for what’s called deferred action, which allows them to stay and work in the US for up to two years.\nHer application is still being processed and now, she anxiously awaits a new work permit.\n“I’ve heard that the new plant that bought HyLife is a bigger company,” Martinez said. “So, I hope it does give good results, since it’s difficult to live here without a job.”\nIn the meantime, however, Martinez doesn’t qualify for unemployment benefits and without that work permit, she said she cannot work legally. She feels stuck in limbo.\n“I can’t complain about HyLife because it was a company that gave us the opportunity to come and work here from Mexico,” she said. “They gave us the opportunity to enter legally into the United States … but since we came here with a visa, we couldn’t complain. Complaining would be like wanting to get fired. And, if that happened we wouldn’t be able to work anywhere else.”\nMartinez is one of the workers choosing to wait in Windom, hoping to get a job when Premium Iowa Pork reopens the plant.\nKivu Immigration Law in Worthington represented more than 60 former HyLife workers who applied for deferred action. Just over 40 of them obtained work permits, and about 20 more still have pending applications. Attorney and owner Erin Schutte Wadzinski said her clients are understandably anxious, but mostly have been successful in getting work authorization.\n“The former HyLife workers who held H-2B visas are hardworking individuals who came to the United States to work, to be financially independent and to provide for our family,” she said. “So, with that work authorization stripped away from them, that’s got to be a helpless feeling.”\nBut not all choose this route, mostly because there are disadvantages with deferred action status. Applicants cannot leave the U.S., possibly separating them from families in their home countries. Deferred action also doesn’t provide any pathway for family members to come to the U.S.\nWadzinski said some workers abandoned their applications because they were able to transfer their status or get a new status through a new employer certified to hire visa holders. Also she said the new deferred action program stemming from the investigation into HyLife didn’t state whether work authorizations will be renewed once the two-year period ends.\n“My perception is that the day they get their work authorization card in the mail, they go seek employment, and right now, [Premium Iowa Pork] is not an option to seek employment at the moment,” she said. “So, I’m sure they’re working elsewhere, whether there would be interest in transitioning to some point in the future, I don’t know. But, they could have that option, if they so desire, since that work permit would grant them authorization to work nearly anywhere.”\nPremium Iowa Pork has not said whether it plans to rehire any of the former plant workers.\nWhen contacted by MPR News for comment, the company referred back to a statement released last fall saying the plant is under renovation. However a company representative says it will reveal its plans in coming months.\nIn the October statement Dan Paquin, president of Premium Iowa Pork said “We are excited to be part of the Windom community and continuing to do what we’ve always done — bring high-quality pork products to families’ tables. With that, we’re moving forward with our plans to physically improve the space to create a modern pork processing facility.”\nHope for a better life\nInside Latino Universal Grocery Store in Windom, owners Janet Hernandez and Victor Acosta wait for customers. The Mountain Lake couple, both 24, saw business slow down after, within the first few months of the plant’s closing, losing their large customer base that mostly worked at HyLife.\nSeveral businesses in downtown Windom have closed since June. Business has fluctuated since then, and while the holiday season saw an uptick of customers, Hernandez said it hasn’t been the same. Customer budgets seem tighter, and grocery prices haven’t gone down much.\nShe and Acosta have been following updates on Premium Iowa, hoping to coordinate the opening of their new grocery store location in Windom with the plant’s reopening. However, they say there’s also a little skepticism in the community as many people have seen the Windom plant change hands several times.\n“There’s a little bit of relief, but at the same time, how long is it going to last?” Hernandez said. “Because, usually there’s bad luck. I don’t know what’s going on, but they usually close after a few years or something happens. And well, it’s like you got to take the opportunity at the moment and see what you can do.”\nA former HyLife employee, Yolanda Cazares, 57, shops at Latino Universal Market. She chats with Hernandez and Acosta, sharing that she and several other workers didn’t get their last paychecks or paid vacations from HyLife when the plant closed.\n“It’s everybody’s problem,” Cazares said. “For everybody it’s a problem. The company no pay [sic] is one problem. Not paying for my vacation, for the people … what happened? No pay for the people who worked in the company, it’s everybody [sic] problem now.”\nStill life goes on. With Hernandez translating, Cazares said many former workers are worried. Especially young families with kids to feed.\n“They’re hopeful that they [will] open, because they’re waiting on that,” Hernandez said. “Everything goes [well] for them, things could change to a better life.”",

    "title": "Florida sea turtles continue being rescued from trap lines as conversations sound alarm",
    "text": "MARATHON, Fla. – This week’s Don’t Trash Our Treasure has a concerning update on Florida sea turtles. Though nesting numbers are up, adult turtles continue to face threats due to human pressure.\nConservationists are warning that more and more of these gentle creatures are getting tangled in marine lines, and not all of them survive.\n“That’s why I’m sounding the alarm, because in 13 years, it’s more than I’ve ever seen,” said Bette Zirkelbach, general manager of The Turtle Hospital in Marathon.\nConservationists warn it’s happening way too often, and it’s endangering South Florida sea turtles.\n“Something has changed,” said Zirkelbach. “It’s not a coincidence when you get an average of one a week. Last week, I had two in two days.”\nFor the past few months, Zirkelbach has been documenting a disturbing trend, an uptick in the number of rescued sea turtles coming in after being found ensnared in trap lines.\n“Since Feb. 18, we have had eight entanglements,” she said. “That’s an average of one a week.”\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission confirmed the increase, saying in a statement:\n“The number of these entanglements (in line equal to or greater than 0.5 cm in diameter) that we have documented so far this year is 16. The previous 5-year average through April is 10. So, yes, sea turtle entanglements have been above average so far this year.”\n“If we’re seeing one a week, how many are out there that are not being reported,” wondered Zirkelbach.\nShe fears there are sea turtles that don’t survive and are never found. The entanglements can be severe enough to acutely restrain or even immobilize the biggest and strongest of species.\n“And because of the tide, it is unable to come up to breathe, so it essentially is entangled and drowns in the trap line,” said Zirkelbach.\nZirkelbach says she documented at least four fatalities in the past four months of turtles tangled in lines.\n“The guess is its commercial, because it’s so many, but we don’t know that information,” she said. “And honestly, it’s hard to get the number off the trap and the colors. We’re literally at sea, not in perfect conditions, and it’s all we can do to save the turtle.”\nBut in a statement released to Local 10, Jerome Young, the executive director of the Florida Keys Commercial Fisherman’s Association, pushed back, maintaining that entanglements are rare.\n“Commercial fisherman have reported an exponential rise in turtle numbers. This as the number of commercial fishing traps continues to decline annually under Florida’s state-enforced trap reduction program,” the statement read.\nZirklebach says while nesting numbers may be up, there’s no data showing an increase in adult turtles.\n“What we’re also seeing is not as many hatchlings getting out to sea,” she said. “What that means is your hatchling success ratio.”\nAs of May 1, all commercial traps and lines should’ve been pulled out of the water.\nStone crab season is over until October, but there’s still a big problem with carelessly discarded fishing gear.\nTake the case of Oliver, a rescued juvenile green sea turtle who was recently released back into the ocean. He was found off a long key, completely entangled in fishing line.\nGreg and Kaleah Keen were picking up trash in the mangroves when they found him.\n“He was tangled up,” said Kaleah Keen. “He had a fishing line braid on his flippers.\n“He had three or four turns around each flipper, and I think three around his neck,” added Greg Keen.\nOliver is one of the lucky ones. Not only did the Keens quickly free him by cutting the fishing line off, they also called The Turtle Hospital, who responded straight away.\n“I don’t believe he would have made it had we not gotten him,” said Kaleah Keen.\nNow finally after a month in rehab, Oliver was strong enough to go home.\nZirklebach hopes by highlighting these stories of survival, people will care more and be more conscious about the impact they make on the marine environment, so that rescues like this won’t have to happen as often.\n“I feel in my heart of hearts, that people want to do the right thing,” she said. “If they’re aware that these long trap lines are entangling our marine life and literally killing them, that they will do better.”\nIt’s important to not that this isn’t just about commercial fisherman. There are a lot of rogue traps and lines out there.\nThis applies to everyone who recreates by the water, to be mindful about your fishing gear. The waste you create at the beach or on your boat and how you dispose of it makes an impact on our marine environment.\nAs we have seen, careless behavior can lead to deadly consequences.\nCopyright 2025 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Post-CrowdStrike, Six Questions to Test Your Company's Operational Resilience",
    "text": "When cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike distributed a faulty software update in July, it impacted a staggering 8.5 million devices. The crisis rippled through commercial airline operations, package delivery logistics, ecommerce, and health care, to name a few.\nThis incident serves as a stark reminder that business disruptions are not just potential threats, but common occurrences that demand immediate attention from CEOs, C-suite teams, and boards. It's time for leaders to take stock of their companies’ operational resilience—their ability to withstand disruptions and crises.\n“Preparation for a crisis is just as crucial as the response.”\nOver 60 percent of tech outages result in at least $100,000 in total losses, and 15 percent cost upward of $1 million, according to the Uptime Institute, a technology trade group. In severe events, 25 percent of businesses won't reopen their doors after a disaster, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Some research reports estimate that the cost of the CrowdStrike event could exceed $1 billion.\nPreparation for a crisis is just as crucial as the response. We recommend that leaders start with their organization’s people, processes, and technology. Here are six essential questions for leaders to ask as they evaluate the operational resilience of this triad:\nAre we sufficiently prepared for problems when they arise?:\n- People: Long before any disaster, it’s crucial for companies to establish a well-trained crisis management team. They will be responsible for designing and maintaining the business continuity and disaster recovery management plan, ensuring a robust and effective response to potential disasters.\n- Process: Maintaining the plan iteratively and conducting test runs for worst-case scenarios such as losing access to crucial functional systems is not just a one-time task, but an ongoing process. This approach fosters a culture of continuous improvement and preparedness, ensuring that the company is always ready to respond to potential disruptions.\n- Technology: Simulate different types of outages and validate the full stack of technology infrastructure to find out if your business could support continuous operations during an actual disruption.\nAre there clear roles and responsibilities for business continuity?\n- People: Clearly define and communicate roles and responsibilities for different disruption scenarios to ensure everyone on the disaster team knows their duties during a crisis. In particular, the team will need primary and backup responsibilities, and guidelines on decision-making. These areas of accountability will help keep the business running.\n- Process: Routinely practice with the actual team. Incorporate unanticipated, random complications and consider scheduling exercises during peak and non-peak business hours. Ensure the dissemination of clear crisis management procedures to provide structured and effective responses during disruptions to all team members and give feedback after the trial runs.\n- Technology: Use necessary technological tools to support assigned roles in crisis management, ensuring seamless operation and coordination, such as different modes of communication and documentation on and off the primary network.\nWhat are our risks involving automated software updates?\n- People: Train product, technology, and security teams to understand and manage the risks of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), the kind of automated software update approach that helped the CrowdStrike outage spread. If your company works closely with vendors, as most do, it’s important to understand their risks, as well as those of partners and customers.\n- Process: Implement a robust vendor management process for critical systems that considers business continuity risk, ensuring transparency, and mutual understanding of the software delivery process. For example, the product, technology, and security teams should be able to find out whether software updates will be or should be rolled out in waves and where this might present a comfortable or uncomfortable level of risk to the business.\n- Technology: Find technologies that give these teams visibility and control over the software supply chain and application security, enabling them to mitigate risks associated with CI/CD.\nAre we prepared for an investigation to correct errors when things inevitably go wrong?\n- People: Make your skilled personnel available if a large-scale investigation arises, including those involving federal authorities.\n- Process: Structure documentation, processes, and communications to effectively support investigations when errors occur. Ensure there is a way to capture, retain, and document decisions and actions with a secure chain of custody plan. Practice this through simulations or so-called “tabletop” exercises.\n- Technology: Equip your organization with capabilities to trace and provide necessary information during investigations, facilitating quick and accurate error correction.\nWho is accountable, and what resources should we provide for our future recovery?\n- People: Establish clear accountability and governance structures, including appropriate legal counsel. Consider where it is needed and proper to have insurance, such as Directors and Officers (D&O) liability coverage, for people in critical roles.\n- Process: Regularly review and update governance structures and business continuity plan documentation, including contracts with vendors and insurers, to reflect evolving risk exposure and infrastructure needs.\n- Technology: Similar to how you would test your tech systems, review your agreements under different scenarios and implications to ensure they would hold up. Also, make sure there are redundant systems to track the terms of vital agreements and contracts.\nHow would we communicate with customers, stakeholders, and investors?\n- People: Communications may fall to people will little experience in outreach. Ensure communication teams and their backups are aligned and trained to handle crisis communication effectively and manage public relations under pressure.\n- Process: Develop a well-defined communication plan that includes benchmarks and standards for timely and transparent outreach during crises. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires companies to disclose material events within four days. Determine whether this is the acceptable benchmark or if disclosure should happen sooner.\n- Technology: Ensure that the modes of communication and supporting technologies are sufficient to maintain the trust and transparency desired by all stakeholders during disruptions.\nContinuous improvement in preparedness and response plans is essential. Accountability, transparency, and effective communication can significantly mitigate risks and enhance operational resilience.\n“As more businesses rely on cloud servers in an automated world, more companies will live and die based on their ability to bounce back from a crisis.”\nDemand for digital transformation and artificial intelligence (AI) will raise the stakes for strategic data and platform management, exposing more companies to risk if they’re not proactive. And as more businesses rely on cloud servers in an automated world, more companies will live and die based on their ability to bounce back from a crisis.\nBy focusing on the people, process, and technology framework, we can better prepare for, respond to, and recover from disruptions, ensuring our business operations' ongoing resilience and success.\nHise O.
