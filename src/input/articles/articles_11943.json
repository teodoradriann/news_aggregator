    "text": "Investigadores de Taiwán han anunciado que han desarrollado la computadora cuántica más pequeña jamás diseñada, utilizando un solo fotón para ejecutar sofisticados algoritmos cuánticos. Dirigido por el profesor Chuu Chih-sung de la Universidad Nacional Tsing Hua de Taiwán (NTHU), el equipo demostró el potencial de esta computadora en miniatura. Según la agencia de noticias Focus Taiwan, esta computadora cuántica compacta codifica información en “32 intervalos de tiempo o dimensiones” dentro del paquete de ondas de un solo fotón, una partícula clave en las interacciones electromagnéticas. Operar a temperatura ambiente proporciona una ventaja económica al reducir los costos asociados con el enfriamiento que a menudo requieren otras computadoras cuánticas. Chuu Chih-sung dijo que los fotones también permiten la transmisión de información a largas distancias con poca interferencia, lo que representa una gran ventaja para las aplicaciones comerciales. “Los estados cuánticos que son estables a temperatura ambiente resultan ser un enorme activo energético”, añadió. Mou Chung-yu, director de la Facultad de Ciencias de NTHU, señaló que la computación cuántica fotónica podría transformar varios campos, desde el desarrollo farmacéutico hasta la seguridad de los datos. “Acabará aplicándose en muchos sectores”, afirmó. Taiwán, con sus 24 millones de habitantes, se destaca como líder en la producción de tecnologías avanzadas, particularmente en los campos de computadoras y semiconductores. Además, es el primero en Asia en términos de libertad en Internet. Senegal",

    "text": "[Volley](/sport/volley/)\nVolley A1 femminile, il derby parla ancora Savino Del Bene Scandicci\nLe biancoblù non sbagliano e vincono per 3-1. Gaspari: \"La battuta non ha funzionato\"\nLa città di Firenze rivive ancora una volta una tradizione che sembra indissolubile. E' per il terzo anno consecutivo che il derby tra la Savino Del Bene Scandicci ed Il Bisonte Firenze si gioca il giorno di Santo Stefano.\nMa oltre a questo c'è un andazzo che si ripete oramai dal 2019: il fatto che sistematicamente, ad aggiudicarsi questa stracittadina, sia la squadra biancoblù.\nEd è accaduto anche questa volta, grazie al 3-1 inflitto alla formazione di Bendandi, che è riuscita a competere soltanto per un set (il primo), salvo poi rassegnarsi alla differenza di valori che è inesorabilmente venuta fuori.\nDiverse sono state le trascinatrici. Prima tra tutte Britt Herbots, eletta MVP per effetto dei suoi 13 punti. Top scorer ancora una volta Ekaterina Antropova, 24 punti.\nPer quanto riguarda le percentuali di squadra le biancoblù l'hanno spuntata nettamente in attacco (47%-34%), mentre in ricezion e le due contendenti si sono equivalse (47%).\nPoche ore di relax e si riparte: domenica alle ore 16 arriverà, sempre a Palazzo Wanny, Bergamo. In palio la final four di Coppa Italia di inizio febbraio a Bologna.\nLa partita\nGaspari si affida a Ognjenovic al palleggio e Antropova opposta, Mingardi e capitan Herbots sono le due schiacciatrici mentre al centro il duo Carol-Nwakalor. Il ruolo di libero è affidato a Castillo.\nAvvio equilibrato, poi sono le bisontine a tentare di scappare (6-9). Antropova pareggia prima (10-10) e trova poi il sorpasso (14-13). Si gioca punto a punto e i vantaggi sono inevitabili: risolve tutto Cagnin portando avanti Firenze (27-29).\nScandicci si scuote e riparte di slancio con il muro di Herbots ai danni di Malual (10-6). Quest'ultima appare ispirata e pareggia al 10 con due aces consecutivi. Nwakalor, sfruttando una grande difesa di Castillo, allunga (14-11), l'ex Bajens vuole farsi rimpiangere e con tre punti in fila rimette tutto in discussione (14-14). Sarà l'ultimo sussulto delle bisontine, che iniziano a sbagliare e subire muri in serie, lasciando campo libero alla Savino Del Bene (25-18).\nAntropova e Mingardi sprintano in avvio di terzo set (6-1). Un altra ex, Ribechi, fa volare le biancoblù sul 19-11. Diagonale di Antropova per il 24-13, chiude Mingardi per un 25-13 senza storia.\nFirenze tenta di giocarsi le ultime carte. Cagnin mura Antropova per il 6-8. Malual sbaglia e determina il sorpasso (11-10). Muro di Carol per il 16-13 e le bisontine praticamente non hanno più nulla da dire. Dal 20-16 si passa al 24-17 per mano di un errore in attacco di Nervini. A dare il colpo finale è Nwakalor per un derby mai realmente in discussione (25-18).\nLe dichiarazioni post gara\nA Marco Gaspari il compito di commentare questo successo: \"Perdere il primo set, per assurdo, ci sta. Quello che oggi non ha funzionato è la battuta. Se andiamo a guardare il bilancio di fine partita, c'è stato un set tirato, poi gli altri li abbiamo vinti 25-18, 25-13 e 25-18 con il muro che è cresciuto, l'attacco che comunque oggi ha viaggiato su numeri buoni. L'ultimo set lo abbiamo giocato molto bene, anche se è stato il nostro peggiore in attacco, questo vuol dire che il lavoro su cui ci siamo concentrati questa settimana ha funzionato. Ha funzionato un pochino meno la battuta, questo mi dispiace perché noi dobbiamo vivere di questo. Nel corso della gara comunque il muro è cresciuto e abbiamo finito con 14 muri punto. Il primo set è andato male, ma ricordiamo che ne Il Bisonte c'è qualità e lo anche dicevo prima della gara, perché Malual per due set ci ha fatto venire il mal di testa. Valuto molto bene l'ingresso della nuova arrivata (ndr, Ribechi), che ci ha dato una mano anche per scaricare un po' Mingardi dalla ricezione. Era importante portare a casa una vittoria piena, anche perché non è facile vincere sempre da tre punti, soprattutto in un derby\".\nTabellino\nSavino Del Bene Scandicci - Il Bisonte Firenze: 3-1 (27-29,25-18,25-13,25-18)\nSavino Del Bene Scandicci: Ribechi, Herbots 13, Castillo (L1), Ruddins (L2), Kotikova n.e., Mancini n.e., Ognjenovic 3, Bajema n.e., Graziani n.e., Nwakalor 16, Carol 11, Antropova 24, Mingardi 15, Gennari n.e..

    "text": "The latest report shows that the ocean surface is increasingly concerning due to strong El Nino and climate change, according to a long-term sea level data set. Rising sea levels can affect low-lying areas. Experts found that El Nino significantly accelerated global sea level rise from 2022 to 2023. In the recent [NWN report](https://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/60957/20240313/rapid-seawater-rise-threatens-low-lying-communities-cartagena-colombia.htm), the rapid rise in seawater threatens communities in Cartagena, Columbia. Researchers discovered that the area could suffer from significant sea level rise due to [increasing global warming](https://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/61041/20240320/un-warns-2024-high-probability-break-record-hot-year.htm) and volcanic formations in the region, resulting in a devastating sinking of land. Ocean Surface, Sea Level Rise Due to Strong El Nino A NOAA report explains that increasing sea levels can suffer more from deadly storm surges and severe weather conditions. People in low-lying communities are more vulnerable to potential risks. In the latest study, a long-term sea level data set was analyzed based on 30 years of satellite observations, with the help of the French TOPEX/Poseidon mission, and the Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich mission. The urgency to understand the sea level impacts is crucial amidst the growing threats of climate change and global warming. \"During La Niña, rain that normally falls in the ocean falls on the land instead, temporarily taking water out of the ocean and lowering sea levels,\" Josh Willis, a researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, said, as quoted in a [report](https://phys.org/news/2024-03-analysis-spike-global-sea-due.html#:~:text=Global%20average%20sea%20level%20rose,the%20course%20of%20a%20year.). The study findings showed that about four inches have been recorded in the rise of the global average sea level since 1993. The researchers pointed out that the rates of acceleration can increase by 2050. Alarmingly, the rapid rise of water can cause more [frequent and devastating flooding](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/swot/nasa-analysis-finds-strong-el-nino-could-bring-extra-floods-this-winter/). From 2022 to 2023, the global sea level increased due to the El Niño phenomenon. La Niña and El Niño can impact seasonal patterns of rainfall, causing frequent warm-ups or precipitation. \"El Niño years, a lot of the rain that normally falls on land ends up in the ocean, which raises sea levels temporarily,\" Willis said.

With sea levels and warming events, low-lying buildings can become more vulnerable. Additionally, as a result of greenhouse gas emissions, climate change can cause frequent storms, floods, wildfires, heatwaves, and droughts, among other severe to extreme weather events. As a result, mitigating climate change impacts is important for the planet to prevent the rapid rise of seawater.

    "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS — In a time-honored Colorado Springs tradition, the [Pikes Peak Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. All People's Breakfast and Unity March](https://www.mlklegacy.org/events) will start at 7:00 am on Monday. Organizers say despite freezing temperatures, they'll still be ready. \"Doesn't matter how cold it is, we'll be out there marching arm in arm,\" said Kimber Reese with the Pikes Peak Diversity Council. Doors will open at the Ed Robson Arena on Colorado College's campus at 7:00 am. Then, poetry and speeches will be held at 8:30. After that, around 10:00 am, the Unity March will start. While the All People's Breakfast will be the same as previous years, the Unity March will be a little different. Events that would typically be held at Acacia Park will be moving inside. \"We usually go to Acacia Park, but because of the freeze warning, we are actually going to host it at the CAC, the Cornerstone Arts Center here on [Colorado College's] campus as well,\" said Reese. Shirley Martinez, the President of the Pikes Peak Diversity Council, also said that the nonprofit MLK Legacy Preservation Society helped organize the events this year. \"It's about becoming together, it's about unity,\" said Martinez. She says the organization aims to bring a younger audience to this year's march. \"This is also an opportunity for us to teach our youth. It's about moving this forward,\" Martinez continued. Colorado College's Collaborative For Community Engagement Office decided to host their [Week of Action](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/offices/cce/our-work/campus-collaborations/week-of-action.html) this week, in honor of the late Dr. King. \"I believe it was first proposed by late Congressman John Lewis to think of the Martin Luther King Holiday not as a day off, but a day on,\" said Director of the CCE Jordan Travis Radke. She says 125 students, staff, and faculty will spend the week helping serve hot meals to homeless youth at The Place, building homes with Habitat for Humanity, and sorting food with Care and Share Food Bank. \"So our ultimate goal in this week is to inspire young people to become community leaders, change-makers, and community builders of the future,\" continued Jordan Travis Radke. CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the group plans to march to the Collaborative Arts Center. The correct name of the facility is the Cornerstone Arts Center. ____ Watch KOAA News5 on your time, anytime with our free streaming app available for your Roku, FireTV, AppleTV and Android TV.
