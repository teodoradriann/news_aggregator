    "title": "Taxa de desemprego sobe para 6,8% em fevereiro, diz IBGE",
    "text": "A taxa de desemprego ficou em 6,8% no trimestre móvel encerrado em fevereiro, ante os 6,5% registrados nos três meses até janeiro. Apesar da ligeira queda, o rendimento médio do trabalho seguiu crescendo, mesmo diante das pressões inflacionárias. Ante o trimestre móvel imediatamente anterior, a alta foi de 1,3%. Em relação a igual período de 2024, avançou 3,6%, atingindo o valor recorde R$ 3.378.\nOs dados são da Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios (Pnad) Contínua, e foram divulgados nesta sexta-feira pelo IBGE .\nAlém do rendimento seguir em alta, o quadro é melhor do que um ano atrás mesmo na taxa de desemprego. No trimestre móvel até fevereiro de 2024, ela ficou em 7,8%.\nAo longo de 2024, com geração de empregos formais e informais, e avanço na renda, a taxa de desemprego registrou a média de 6,6%, o menor nível da série histórica da Pnad Contínua, que começa em 2012 .\nCenário ‘incômodo’: Por que o Banco Central projeta inflação fora da meta até 2027?\nNo geral, com exceção do rendimento médio, os indicadores pioraram na passagem do trimestre móvel terminado em novembro para o período de três meses encerrado em fevereiro. A taxa de desemprego foi de 6,1% no trimestre móvel até novembro.\nFatores sazonais, mas recorde no emprego com carteira\nA alta do desemprego neste início do ano também pode ser explicada por fatores sazonais. Tradicionalmente, há aumento na taxa de desemprego e no total de desempregados no início de cada ano, por conta dos desligamentos de trabalhadores que estavam nas vagas temporárias tipicamente abertas no fim do ano anterior, segundo explicam economistas.\nNa passagem do trimestre móvel terminado em novembro para o encerrado em fevereiro, 1,2 milhão de trabalhadores perderam seus empregos, quando se compara o total da população ocupada. Esse contingente encolheu em 1,2% nessa base de comparação.\nMesmo com a queda, as demissões parecem ter ocorrido nas vagas consideradas mais precárias, como informais ou empregados domésticos. Isso porque foram criados 421 mil empregos com carteira assinada no setor privado (sem contas domésticas). O total de empregados formais nessas condições ficou em 39,6 milhões, recorde da série histórica iniciada em 2012.\nBrasil afora: Desemprego em 2024 foi o menor já registrado em 14 estados brasileiros, taxa fica abaixo de 3% em alguns; veja lista\nCom a queda na ocupação, 701 mil pessoas entraram para a fila do desemprego – nem todo mundo que perde o emprego vai para a desocupação, já que, conforme os conceitos internacionalmente utilizados, o trabalhador precisa estar em busca de uma vaga para ser considerado desempregado.\nFoi um aumento de 10,4% na população desocupada nessa base de comparação. No total, são 7,5 milhões de desempregados.\nAnte 1 ano antes, indicadores melhoram\nNa comparação com um ano antes, os dados seguem melhores de forma mais generalizada. Foram geradas 2,4 milhões de vagas, considerando a evolução da população ocupada, que cresceu 2,4%. Já o total de desempregados caiu 12,5%.\nA taxa de desemprego repetiu o mesmo nível de igual período de 2014, ressaltou Adriana Beringuy, pesquisadora do IBGE.\nMesmo assim, nos últimos meses, especialistas vêm alertando que se espera uma desaceleração no mercado de trabalho ao longo deste ano . A expectativa é que os indicadores não sejam tão bons quanto em 2024, em parte por causa dos efeitos do aperto na política de juros pelo Banco Central (BC).",

    "text": "- Recognized for excellence in augmented reality technology, apps, and device sets. - To be showcased at the CES 2024 booth... with a new Disney product launch planned for the first half of the year. Woongjin Thinkbig's ARpedia, a global edutech product, has won the 'CES 2024 Innovation Award', marking the first time a Korean educational company has achieved this honor three times in a row. Leading the global education market as a pioneering edutech solution, ARpedia has demonstrated its unique augmented reality technology and innovation. ARpedia, developed by Woongjin Thinkbig, one of Korea's leading edutech companies, is an 'Interactive Book' that provides a three-dimensional reading experience by bringing characters and illustrations from books to life through augmented reality (AR) technology. In Korea, it's a popular series with over 6 million individual books sold. Internationally, it has proven its market potential with contracts to supply at least 80,000 sets annually in the Chinese-speaking region (China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau). This achievement is largely attributed to the global recognition of ARpedia's unique technology and educational effectiveness. At CES 2024, ARpedia won the 'Mobile Devices and Accessories' innovation award, securing its third consecutive title. This particular win is noteworthy as it acknowledges the excellence of ARpedia in all aspects of its set, including augmented reality technology (CES 2023, AR/VR category), apps (CES 2022-2023, Mobile Apps category), and devices (CES 2024). Woongjin Thinkbig plans to introduce ARpedia to business representatives and visitors from various countries at CES 2024. Attendees will have the opportunity to explore all series that comprise the ARpedia set and learn in detail about the products' features and usage. Furthermore, Woongjin Thinkbig is set to launch a new reading series, 'Disney Interactive Reading', in the first half of this year, based on a licensing agreement with Walt Disney. The initial marketing strategy will focus on Asian countries, where there is high demand for English reading education. Sam-rak Choi, the head of Woongjin Thinkbig's EduTech Research Institute, commented, \"ARpedia is sought after by companies and educational industry representatives in 24 countries where it is currently exported. With various new products including Disney Interactive Reading slated for release this year, it is poised to establish itself as a global representative edutech product”. ▲ Introduction of ARpedia ARpedia, an experiential reading product that provides a three-dimensional reading experience through augmented reality (AR) technology, was launched in Korea in 2019 under the 'Interactive Book' brand. Targeting the international market, the English version of 'ARpedia' has received much acclaim and several global awards, including being the first Korean educational company to win the 'CES Innovation Award' three times in a row. In 2022 alone, ARpedia won the 'Kid’s Judge BETT', 'Mom’s Choice Award', and 'Teacher’s Choice Award', proving its success with children, parents, and teachers alike. In July 2023, Woongjin Thinkbig signed a licensing agreement with global entertainment giant Walt Disney for the launch of the Disney series.

    "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. — With the fate of new U.S. aid to Ukraine increasingly in doubt, representatives of Ohio’s large Ukrainian-American community and their elected officials said they were growing alarmed by the failure of Congress to act.\nWhat You Need To Know Members of Congressional Ukraine Caucus met Wednesday to launch Ukrainian Week DC, a summit of U.S. and Ukrainian leaders\nThe fate of billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine is increasingly in doubt amid Republican opposition\nPolitical analysts said elected officials who don't support the bill could lose support of large Ohio Ukrainian-American community Ukrainian Week DC , a summit of U.S. and Ukrainian leaders, opened Jan. 31 with a plea from Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, founder of the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus:\n“Now is the moment for our nation and this Congress to reaffirm our commitment to a foreign policy that promotes liberty—and liberty across our world.”\nDemocrats have spent months trying to negotiate border security reforms, hoping to win Republican support for tens of billions of dollars in new aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\nThe $110 billion national security package appears to be unraveling, however. House GOP leadership has said the Senate-negotiated deal would be dead on arrival in the House due to opposition from party members and former President Donald Trump.\nNo matter how aid is passed, Ukraine advocates said it needs to happen soon.\n“There’s grave concern over the lack of consensus on the resolution, including funding for Ukraine. Everybody knows what the stakes are for this country,” said George Jaskiw, vice president of United Ukrainian Organizations of Ohio.\nIn areas with a large Ukrainian population, like Northeast Ohio, voters are using their numbers to press elected officials toward approving more aid. Ohio is home to about 42,000 people of Ukrainian descent, with more than a third living in Northeast Ohio.\n“They believe that this is not just an issue for them, this is an issue for U.S. security. They see it in much more global, geopolitical historic terms,” Jaskiw said. “So yes they’re concerned, they’re watching, and I would imagine that when elections come around, those concerns would come into play at the ballot box.”\nPolitical analysts warned that not passing Ukraine aid could cost future votes for some Ohio lawmakers.\n“Anybody representing Northeast Ohio needs to tread lightly when it comes to Ukraine aid. The Republican Party has been on the wrong side of this issue, with a lot of Republicans being very vocal, such as J.D. Vance being very vocal, in saying that the United States should no longer support Ukraine,” said Dave Cohen, professor of political science at the University of Akron.\nSome Ohio lawmakers, however, appeared to remain unmoved. Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, said he doubted the national security package would pass.\n“The proposal, I think, is about to die on the vine,” he said.\nVance, who has opposed additional funding for Ukraine, said he favors decoupling Ukraine aid from the stalled national security package. On Wednesday Vance and Rep. Kevin Herman, R-Okla., moved ahead to pass aid for Israel aid instead by proposing a clean, un-offset aid package for Israel. The proposal differs from a bill passed last year in the House that would provide $14.3 billion in aid to Israel but would offset the spending with funding cuts to the IRS.\n“We’ve said for a long time that the Israel issue is separate from the Ukraine issue and the effort by some in Washington to combine this stuff together and deprive the American people of a debate is a huge mistake,” he said.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., this week floated the idea of passing Ukraine funding separate from the border security package. However, unbundling the aid package could make it harder to pass the new Ukraine aid.\nThe European Union on Thursday agreed to extend 50 billion euros, or $54 billion, in new aid to Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he hoped the EU decision would help spur Congress to follow suit.",

The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement.\nMolldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up.\nTreatment called 'inconceivable' Gypsy Rose Blanchard released from Missouri prison early Thursday morning, DOC confirms Cher files for conservatorship of her son, claims Elijah Blue Allman's life is 'at risk' Ex-boyfriend of missing St. Louis woman admits to her murder after Wisconsin arrest: Police 6 dead, 3 injured in Johnson County, Texas, crash; victims include 2 young kids ages 9, 10 California Pizza Huts lay off all delivery drivers ahead of minimum wage increase “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote Dr. Avrum Goldstein, a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit.\nGoldstein, who is a faculty member at NOVA Southeastern University , also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment.\n\"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.”\nDoctors remove wrong organ from man: They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.\nThe lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg.\n“Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote.\nWilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages.\nWilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "Descubrimiento médico: la nueva y única cirugía que puede cambiar el color de los ojos pero es muy peligrosa\nLa queratopigmentación representa una nueva frontera en la estética ocular, pero su falta de regulación y los graves riesgos asociados hacen imprescindible la cautela.\nEn el competitivo mundo de la estética, una [nueva tendencia](/tools/redirect.php?t=3&i=1320622&s=faf5c7a3c9b3cda7ee015aab9360b256) ha generado controversia tanto en la comunidad médica como entre las [autoridades sanitarias](/tools/redirect.php?t=3&i=1319054&s=00d063b3260abd8ac15809551ced1636): la cirugía para cambiar el color de los ojos.\nAunque su popularidad ha crecido rápidamente, este procedimiento no está aprobado por la [Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de los Estados Unidos (FDA)](/tools/redirect.php?t=3&i=1319457&s=25411dabc170f31b5012084408093bd4), lo que pone en tela de juicio su seguridad y efectividad.\n[Descubrimiento arqueológico: hallan una nueva civilización en Latinoamérica](/tools/redirect.php?t=3&i=1320966&s=be9950537657ef8f1a1548626081f8a7)\n¿Cómo funciona la operación de la alteración en el color del iris?\nEl [procedimiento](/tools/redirect.php?t=3&i=1315930&s=0568b7a229001f40d35a9ab0e1d2693e), conocido como queratopigmentación, consiste en tatuar la córnea para alterar el color del iris.\nAunque la técnica se realiza en entornos clínicos, numerosos especialistas advierten sobre los [riesgos](/tools/redirect.php?t=3&i=1315930&s=0568b7a229001f40d35a9ab0e1d2693e) que conlleva. Estudios recientes destacan que la operación puede provocar graves complicaciones, como glaucoma, sensibilidad extrema a la luz, pérdida parcial o total de visión, e incluso ceguera permanente.\nUno de los aspectos más preocupantes de esta cirugía es su falta de respaldo por parte de la [FDA](/tools/redirect.php?t=3&i=1317757&s=0246d8bd98246f2adbed78528fca20b9). En muchos estados de EE. UU., la intervención es ilegal o está severamente restringida debido a los riesgos para la salud ocular. Esta situación ha llevado a que pacientes busquen alternativas en países donde la regulación es menos estricta, exponiéndose a estándares médicos potencialmente inferiores.\n¿Cuánto cuesta cambiar el color de los ojos?\nEl costo de la queratopigmentación asciende a aproximadamente USD 12,000 en clínicas reconocidas de Nueva York. Este elevado precio no incluye los gastos relacionados con [posibles complicaciones](/tools/redirect.php?t=3&i=1316193&s=46fb05459ed8c7cd35e4f251cbc62603) posteriores, como tratamientos para mitigar los efectos secundarios o corregir errores quirúrgicos.\nEstos son los riesgos de la cirugía del cambio de color de ojos\nLa comunidad médica es unánime en su advertencia sobre los peligros de este procedimiento estético. A diferencia de otras intervenciones aprobadas y reguladas, la queratopigmentación carece de [investigaciones exhaustivas](/tools/redirect.php?t=3&i=1315930&s=0568b7a229001f40d35a9ab0e1d2693e) que respalden su seguridad a largo plazo.\nPara quienes desean cambiar temporalmente el color de sus ojos, el uso de lentes de contacto de color sigue siendo la opción más segura y económica. Este [método](/tools/redirect.php?t=3&i=1314356&s=452b28fb251f5f259acc047cd24ef516) no invasivo evita los riesgos asociados con la cirugía y ofrece una amplia variedad de tonalidades que se adaptan a diferentes preferencias estéticas.\nAntes de someterse a este procedimiento, es fundamental consultar con especialistas en salud ocular y considerar las consecuencias a largo plazo.

    "text": "Washington: US President Joe Biden on Thursday said his deputy, Vice President Kamala Harris, is “qualified” to lead the county.\nAt a press conference here, Biden said, “From the very beginning, I made no bones about that. She is qualified to be the president. That’s why I picked her.”\nWhen asked about the reasons for this, he said “Firstly because of the way she’s handled the issue of freedom of women’s bodies, to have control of their bodies and secondly, her ability to handle almost any issue on the board.”\n“This was a hell of a prosecutor. She was a first rate person and in the Senate, she was really good. I wouldn’t have picked her unless I thought she was qualified to be the president,” Biden said.\nThe president mistakenly referred to Kamala Harris as Donald Trump during the press conference. He said, “I wouldn’t have picked Trump to be the vice president, did I think she was not qualified to be president….”\n“The fact is that the consideration is that I think I’m the most qualified person to run for president. I beat him once and I will beat him again,” Biden said.\n“The idea that senators and congressmen are running for office worrying about the ticket is not unusual. And I might add, there were at least five presidents running or incumbent presidents who had lower numbers than I have now later in a campaign,” he said.\nSo, there’s a long way to go in this campaign and so I’m just going to keep moving, he said.",

Your generosity smashed all previous fundraising records, raising $7450.21!\nRationalWiki:Chicken coop/Archive135\n[Jump to navigation](#mw-head) [Jump to search](#searchInput)\nFairDinkum\nThis user has been fairly problematic for quite a while, so it's time they get their fair due. For those who weren't paying attention, this whole mess started on 11 February, when\nFairDinkum reverted one of Nope Rocket's edits, and Nope Rocket took issue with FairDinkum's tone. Two days later, they left this diatribe on [User talk:Luigifan18](/wiki/User_talk:Luigifan18), basically yelling at them for a couple of minor grammar mistakes, and this time Ace took issue with it. 16 February, Ace edits Nope Rocket's topic to tell FairDinkum to stop their agressive behavior, and then in a separate topic asks an innocuous question about FairDinkum's music taste. Then, and this is when shit truly hits the fan, FairDinkum accuses Ace of attempting to dox them, which is a serious accusation to be throwing around with no evidence. After this, FairDinkum repeatedly engages in insults and baseless accusations (most of this is logged on their talk page) and has been dragging this drama out for three weeks at this point, and has only been getting worse, throwing personal attacks at any user who even thinks of calling out their behavior. This goes beyond mere incivility and drama-mongering and shows a basic lack of understanding on how to get along with other users on what is supposed to be a collaborative project; most wikis would have tossed this person a long time ago for egregious violations of basic civility standards. Now for what to do, I think they need a ban of at least three weeks from this site. Interaction bans won't work, they've been flaming like five separate users and anyone who calls them out on their incivility is added to their shitlist. The only solution is to make it clear that their unwillingness to get along with other users is completely unacceptable and that they can't just sling baseless accusations, personal attacks, and childish tantrums around. And it's not like we're dealing with some immature teenager, Fair Dinkum is ( by their own admission) a 52-year old adult with four decades of Internet experience, so they should really know better. I'm getting tired of this, so let's come up with a solution.

The stuff on Luigifan18's talk page looks fine so far, there's an apology to Luigifan18 in there for being overzealous. There is some mutual hostility with Ace in here nothing out-of-hand yet. The question about music from Ace sounds like a kind of olive branch, maybe - but FairDinkum rejects it. Eh, I have some sympathy for a paranoid mind (since I have one too). The accusation of intent-to-dox doesn't look great. Its not technically an accusation of doxxing, but sure, it is bad to make that sort of claim. And now we start going down the dark path\n[[1]]https://rationalwiki.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AFairDinkum&type=revision&diff=2527861&oldid=2527356%7C, letting paranoia get the better of him. I've been there before brother, yah gotta catch yourself before things start spiraling out of control. Its not easy to do man, its not easy. --- And we've got more fun times with Ace... needling the paranoid man is really not helpful. The whale smack arrives, and some more folks are saying stuff, looks like the attacks against people other than Ace start here ... and Ohhh boy, and now Ace is demanding a retraction, that's not going to end well. And the second whale smack comes in from Plutocow. @ [Plutocow](/wiki/User:Plutocow)What prompted that exactly? This is a lot to wade through without a guide (thanks for the links provided so far btw). And reading the rest of the page we find more of the same, anger from FairDinkum at any one perceived to be against him, Ace continues to be active, and some other folks commenting on the proceedings.

The stuff on Luigifan18's talk page looks fine so far, there's an apology to Luigifan18 in there for being overzealous. There is some mutual hostility with Ace in here nothing out-of-hand yet. The question about music from Ace sounds like a kind of olive branch, maybe - but FairDinkum rejects it. Eh, I have some sympathy for a paranoid mind (since I have one too). The accusation of intent-to-dox doesn't look great. Its not technically an accusation of doxxing, but sure, it is bad to make that sort of claim. And now we start going down the dark path\n- Na, I reckon a week. Their first block and enough to say \"Dude, we've given you a block. Learn from it, chill a bit, and we'll try again\". Then we can start longer blocks. Give him fair enough chance to learn from it first.\n- I also agree. A 3 week block is more than reasonable, and hopefully this user will spend the time off moving on and letting shit go.\n- Agreed. Was observing this over the past while (real life keeping me too busy to comment much), but FairDinkum needs some sort of action taken here. --\n- As much as I appreciate them trying to stand up for me regarding that \"minimod\" thing, the personal attacks were uncalled for…\nFairDinkum has not responded on this page, but has posted\nan apologia of sorts in the RW Saloon. I have read both the post and the Essay referenced there on Argumentation. It seems well-intentioned, though I cannot endorse it as a worthwhile project. FairDinkum may well proceed with his project, should he choose to return after their time off from RW.

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#3](c3#c-3) y está escrito, en su libro mágico, que todos los no judíos existen para servir a los judíos.\nSu libro mágico es el bueno, los demás libros mágicos no.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Típico de fanatismos y sectas cuando se hace una barrera entre los que están dentro y los que están fuera. Cuando la religión no respeta otras formas de ver el mundo es cuando empiezan los fanatismos y las hostias. Si no se acepta la diversidad de credos, apaga y vámonos porque lo que viene luego no es agradable para nadie.\nLuego empezarán con sus Frentes Populares de Judea y acabarán a hostia limpia entre ellos, porque alguien que necesita y busca enemigos para elevar su moral y sus creencias son un saco de hostias en potencia. Alguien que piense así, tiene todas las papeletas para recibir hostias a cascoporro y es lo que van buscando. Quien anda con fuego acaba quemándose.\n[#9](c9#c-9) Creo que el problema es que eso lo dice la religión de los judíos, que son descendientes de no sé qué tribu elegida por un dios.\nY habrá judíos que se tomen el judaismo como pertenencia a un grupo y lo reinterpretan y lo ponen al servicio de su vida (igual que hay cristianos que no apedrean a su hija si se casa sin el permiso de su padre). Pero el judaismo tiene una base de supremacismo muy mala de esquivar.\nPues para ser el pueblo elegido:\n- menuda mierda territorio les ha dado, a mí que me den algo que no sea un puto desierto: Francia, El norte de España, Italia, las Seychelles, las mismas orillas del Nilo, Mesopotamia. Zonas fértiles.\n- Salvo los últimos 70 años les han dado más que a una estera.\nAsí que menudo dios cutre.\n[#11](c11#c-11) Eso es: si su dios los hubiera elegido y les tuviera cariño bien pudo haberles dao cuerpo de senegalés...\n[#11](c11#c-11) Un amigo ingeniero agrónomo me contó que aquella zona en tiempos bíblicos fue un vergel, pero empezaron a regar los cultivos con agua de mar y se lo cargaron. No son muy listos los “elegidos”.\nSi Dios existiera haría un fisting con su culo y les enviaría al puto infierno por toda la eternidad.\nEs supremacista (pueblo elegido, el resto está para servir) y elitista (no buscan crear nuevos adeptos como en el cristianismo o islamismo o naces judío o no eres judío)\nEsto lo dicen los lideres religiosos judios y la mayoria de ellos lo aceptan como algo natural y te lo repiten con otras palabras menos extremas pero que vienen a ser lo mismo\nPues al final hablando así hasta hacen buenos a los nazis, igual estaban engañados con esta gente...",
