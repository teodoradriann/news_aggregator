    "text": "SHREVEPORT, La. (KSLA) - Happy Sunday! Today’s highs will be approaching or breaking daily record highs around the area. Highs will be ranging from the lower 90s to the north to the upper 90s, maybe even the triple digits, near east Texas! This is mainly due to compressional heating from the incoming cold front from the northwest, which is destined to bring us more fall-like weather.\nThe incoming cold front will remain dry and will move southeastward across most of the country, sending our highs into the 80s by Monday and Tuesday and into the 70s by Wednesday! Our lows will also drop into the 40s for a couple of mornings before rising back into the 50s later in the week. Something exciting to look forward to if you are tired of the warm weather!\nToday, though, there is an elevated risk for wildfires around the ArkLaTex. This is caused by breezy conditions, dry vegetation, and relatively low humidity. Some key things to watch out for today, and the next few days, are properly disposing of cigarettes and avoiding activities involving an open flame or spark. Stay safe and enjoy your Sunday!\nCopyright 2024 KSLA.

A jury trial is scheduled for August 2025 in US District Court in San Francisco. The lawsuit concerns Google's Web & App Activity (WAA) settings, with the lead plaintiff representing two subclasses of people with Android and non-Android phones who opted out of tracking. \"The WAA button is a Google account setting that purports to give users privacy control of Google's data logging of the user's web app and activity, such as a user's searches and activity from other Google services, information associated with the user's activity, and information about the user's location and device,\" wrote (PDF) US District Judge Richard Seeborg, the chief judge in the Northern District Of California. Google says that Web & App Activity \"saves your activity on Google sites and apps, including associated info like location, to give you faster searches, better recommendations, and more personalized experiences in Maps, Search, and other Google services.\" Google also has a supplemental Web App and Activity setting that the judge's ruling refers to as \"(s)WAA.\" \"The (s)WAA button, which can only be switched on if WAA is also switched on, governs information regarding a user's '[Google] Chrome history and activity from sites, apps, and devices that use Google services.' Disabling WAA also disables the (s)WAA button,\" Seeborg wrote. But data is still sent to third-party app developers through the Google Analytics for Firebase (GA4F), \"a free analytical tool that takes user data from the Firebase kit and provides app developers with insight on app usage and user engagement,\" the ruling said. GA4F \"is integrated in 60 percent of the top apps\" and \"works by automatically sending to Google a user's ad interactions and certain identifiers regardless of a user's (s)WAA settings, and Google will, in turn, provide analysis of that data back to the app developer.\" Plaintiffs have brought claims of privacy invasion under California law. Plaintiffs \"present evidence that their data has economic value,\" and \"a reasonable juror could find that Plaintiffs suffered damage or loss because Google profited from the misappropriation of their data,\" Seeborg wrote. The lawsuit was filed in July 2020. The judge notes that summary judgment can be granted when \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Google hasn't met that standard, he ruled. In a statement provided to Ars, Google said that \"privacy controls have long been built into our service and the allegations here are a deliberate attempt to mischaracterize the way our products work. We will continue to make our case in court against these patently false claims.\"Read more of this story at Slashdot.\nClick here to read full news..\nAll Channels\nNigerian Dailies:\nPunch\n|\nVanguard\n|\nThe Nation\n|\nThisday\n|\nDaily Sun\n|\nGuardian\n|\nDaily Times\n|\nDaily Trust\n|\nDaily Independent\n|\nThe Herald\n|\nTribune\n|\nLeadership\n|\nNational Mirror\n|\nBusinessDay\n|\nNew Telegraph\n|\nPeoples Daily\n|\nBlueprint\n|\nNigerian Pilot\n|\nSahara Reporters\n|\nPremium Times\n|\nThe Cable\n|\nPM News\n|\nAPO Africa Newsroom\nCategories Today:\nWorld\n|\nSports\n|\nTechnology\n|\nEntertainment\n|\nBusiness\n|\nPolitics\n|\nColumns\n|\nAll Headlines Today\nEntertainment (Local):\nLinda Ikeji\n|\nBella Naija\n|\nTori\n|\nDaily News 24\n|\nPulse\n|\nThe NET\n|\nDailyPost\n|\nInformation Nigeria\n|\nGistlover\n|\nLailas Blog\n|\nMiss Petite\n|\nOlufamous\n|\nStella Dimoko Korkus Blog\n|\nYnaija\n|\nAll Entertainment News Today\nEntertainment (World):\nTMZ\n|\nDaily Mail\n|\nHuffington Post\nSports:\nGoal\n|\nAfrican Football\n|\nBleacher Report\n|\nFTBpro\n|\nKickoff\n|\nAll Sports Headlines Today\nBusiness & Finance:\nNairametrics\n|\nNigerian Tenders\n|\nBusiness Insider\n|\nForbes\n|\nEntrepreneur\n|\nThe Economist\n|\nBusinessTech\n|\nFinancial Watch\n|\nBusinessDay\n|\nAll Business News Headlines Today\nTechnology (Local):\nTechpoint\n|\nTechMoran\n|\nTechCity\n|\nInnovation Village\n|\nIT News Africa\n|\nTechnology Times\n|\nTechnext\n|\nTechcabal\n|\nAll Technology News Headlines Today\nTechnology (World):\nTechcrunch\n|\nTechmeme\n|\nSlashdot\n|\nWired\n|\nHackers News\n|\nEngadget\n|\nPocket Lint\n|\nThe Verge\nInternational Networks:\n|\nCNN\n|\nBBC\n|\nAl Jazeera\n|\nYahoo\nForum:\n|\nNairaland\n|\nNaij\nOther Links:\nHome\n|\nNigerian Jobs\nHome\n|\nAbout Us\n|\nContact Us\n|\nDisclaimer\n|\nPrivacy Policy\n|\nCopyright\n|\nSubscribe To News Alert\n|\nFacebook\n|\nTwitter\nAll trademarks and copyrights on this page are owned by their respective owners\nCopyright © 2025. latestnigeriannews.com - All rights reserved",

(Getty Images / SellOnlineMarketing) After vanishing during a solo surf session on Wednesday afternoon, a 19-year-old Australian was found alive on a remote island the next day, in what the teen's father is calling a \"one in a million miracle.\" After Darcy Deefholts failed to return home, his family alerted authorities, prompting a search around the area of Wooli Beach, which is located 300 miles north of Sydney. That search was paused Wednesday night due to poor visibility, reports 7 News, and Darcy's dad took to Facebook to plead for help at first light. \"I need boats, beach walkers, drones, 4WDs and planes,\" Terry Deefholts wrote. \"My boy Darcy is still missing ... of course we are fearing the worst.\" But just an hour into the search on Thursday, crews discovered the teenager on North Solitary Island, an uninhabited island that sits about seven miles off the coast, reports CBS News. Rescue teams shared their relief online, describing themselves as \"jumping for joy\" at the \"incredible outcome.\" The Guardian reports Deefholts was taken to Grafton base hospital in stable condition. \"The patient is in good spirits and is being supported by family,\" a rep for the northern New South Wales health district said. Officials haven't detailed how Deefholts ended up on the uninhabited island or what exactly happened during his night offshore. Read These Next GOP Sen.

    "text": "Rebeka Zeljko Daily Caller News Foundation Advancing American Freedom, a conservative group founded by former Vice President Mike Pence, is sounding the alarm about a Biden administration effort to collect Americans’ private financial information, according to a memo obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation. The [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://dailycaller.com/2024/04/26/opinion-bidens-securities-and-exchange-commission-is-after-your-privacy-brian-reardon/) (SEC) in 2012 authorized a program to make it easier for financial regulators to track transactions in U.S. markets by creating a “consolidated audit trail,” or CAT. This would require brokerages and exchanges to collect and report certain financial information to regulators and other financial organizations. Under the Biden administration, the SEC [approved](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/rule613-info) a new [funding model](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/nms/2023/34-98290.pdf) for CAT in September 2023. [Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!](https://www.wnd.com/newsletter-subscription/) The [AAF memo](https://advancingamericanfreedom.com/aaf-bidens-secret-massive-database-of-your-financial-holdings/) warned that the CAT program was effectively an “Orwellian” government database of Americans’ personal information, and urged lawmakers to back a bill that would prevent the SEC from forcing financial institutions to hand over Americans’ information. The bill, known as [H.R. 4551](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4551) or the Protecting Investors’ Personally Identifiable Information Act, was introduced by Republican Rep. [Barry Loudermilk](https://loudermilk.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=4309) of Georgia. “We have witnessed abuses by other government agencies, including the IRS releasing private financial information,” AAF Chairman Marc Short told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “This unconstitutional and reckless [regulatory overreach](https://dailycaller.com/2023/06/15/exclusive-rep-byron-donalds-moves-to-curb-bidens-regulatory-overreach/) must be stopped.” The memo notes that in March 2020, former [SEC Chairman Jay Clayton](https://dailycaller.com/2017/01/04/trump-nominates-jay-clayton-for-sec-chairman-this-is-how-he-plans-on-unshackling-the-economy/) issued an [order](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/exorders/2020/34-88393.pdf) to limit the collection of personal information. “I believe the CAT’s regulatory objectives can be achieved without collection of the most sensitive pieces of retail investor information,” Clayton said in a [statement](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-clayton-cat-covid-19-nal-cybersecurity-2020-03-17). “It is important to minimize the impact of any potential data breaches, while also evaluating the need for cybersecurity improvements to the CAT.” The House Appropriations Committee’s financial services [spending bill](https://appropriations.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-appropriations.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/fy25-fsgg-subcommittee-bill-summary.pdf) would also prohibit the SEC from collecting personal information pertaining to CAT. The bill also [cuts SEC funding](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2024/06/04/house-spending-bill-cuts-sec-budget-curbs-cat-data-collection/) by $589 million below their requested 2025 fiscal budget and $144.3 million below their current 2024 fiscal budget.

    "text": "BYD El gigante chino de los vehículos eléctricos BYD inauguró este jueves una planta en Tailandia, continuando su expansión internacional a pesar de la desaceleración del mercado. (Lea:Kia llegó al primer lugar de ventas en el mercado nacional) La planta en Rayong, una zona industrial al sureste de Bangkok, podrá fabricar hasta 150.000 vehículos al año, indicó la compañía que domina el mercado chino. Wang Chuanfu, director ejecutivo de BYD, con sede en Shenzhen, afirmó que la producción se centrará inicialmente en vehículos totalmente eléctricos y luego se expandiría para incluir híbridos enchufables, que combinan un motor convencional con uno eléctrico. (También: BWM deberá indemnizar a clientes que compraron vehículos con precios &#039;inflados&#039;) &quot;La planta de BYD Tailandia tiene una capacidad anual de 150.000 vehículos, incluidos los cuatro procesos principales de producción de vehículos y piezas, y creará unos 10.000 puestos de trabajo&quot;, dijo Wang en la ceremonia de inauguración. En el cuarto trimestre de 2023 BYD superó a Tesla y se convirtió en el líder mundial de vehículos eléctricos, aunque la compañía de Elon Musk volvió al primer lugar en el primer trimestre de este año. China está liderando el cambio global hacia el coche eléctrico y se prevé que en 2030 casi uno de cada tres coches que circulen en sus carreteras será eléctrico, según la Agencia Internacional de la Energía.

    "title": "Enchentes na Espanha: MotoGP cancela última etapa em Valência",
    "text": "Condições climáticas extremas atingiram a região e já causaram a morte de 205 pessoas; deslizamentos também destruíram acessos ao circuito onde aconteceria a prova As enchentes que atingiram a Espanha, nesta semana, obrigaram os organizadores da MotoGP a cancelar a etapa de Valência. Previsto para acontecer entre 15 e 17 de novembro, o GP de Valência iria encerrar a temporada da MotoGP , como já virou tradição. Os organizadores da competição afirmaram que irão anunciar um novo local e data para a última etapa do ano, em breve. “A MotoGP está com a Comunidade Valenciana após as devastadoras enchentes que afetaram a área. Nossos corações estão com todos aqueles que foram perdidos e aqueles que perderam tanto. Estamos em contato constante com as autoridades locais e o circuito para avaliar melhor como podemos ajudar e como devemos proceder”, disseram os organizadores em nota. Até hoje, 1/11, o número de mortos pelas enchentes confirmado pelas autoridades chegava a 205. Condições climáticas extremas atingiram grande parte da Espanha, nesta semana, com a região de Valência sendo uma das mais afetadas. Os deslizamentos de terra, de fato, destruíram completamente algumas partes do circuito Ricardo Tormo , onde acontece a prova. Há estradas de acesso que desabaram e enormes quantidades de danos. Difícil imaginar que o local poderia receber um grande prêmio da MotoGP, que reúne três categorias (Moto1, Moto2 e MotoGP) e quase 200 mil pessoas no circuito. Em um comunicado divulgado hoje, os organizadores da MotoGP confirmaram que não correrão em Valência, mas sim por Valência. “O campeonato colocará todos os esforços coletivos para apoiar os fundos de auxílio já existentes e garantir que nosso impacto positivo possa chegar à área e às comunidades atingidas”. MotoGP na Malásia Neste próximo final de semana, 2 e 3/11, a MotoGP disputa a penúltima etapa da temporada 2024 no circuito de Sepang, na Malásia. O espanhol Jorge Martin (Ducati/ Prima Pramac Racing) lidera a categoria MotoGP, a principal do campeonato, com 453 pontos. O italiano Francesco Bagnaia (Ducati Lenovo Team), da equipe oficial da marca italiana, vem logo atrás com 436 pontos. Bagnaia, porém, ainda tem chances de virar o jogo, pois há 74 pontos em jogo nas duas últimas etapas. Quer uma navegação personalizada?
