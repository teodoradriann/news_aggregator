    "title": "Comment on Moo Deng Recipe - Thai Bouncy Pork Meatballs by James Davidson",
    "text": "Who would've thought that one day an adorable Thai baby hippo named Moo Deng would become a global sensation? But here we are. As you may know, moo deng is actually the name of a Thai food, so I thought I'd share my moo deng recipe because it's an easy, tasty and versatile pork meatballs that you can add to so many dishes.\nWhat is moo deng?\nMoo means pork, and deng means bouncy, and it refers to a kind of pork bouncy pork meatballs that we put in various dishes, typically noodle soups, including the viral tom yum instant noodles, pictured below. Sometimes, the pork is formed into patties instead of balls.\nSome non-Thai news outlets have been incorrectly reporting that moo deng means \"bouncing pig,\" which I suppose is correct on paper, but not in practice. It's a classic case of \"lost in translation\" because in Thai, moo means both pork and pig (the same way that \"chicken\" refers to both the animal and the meat). But moo deng is a food!\nIngredients and Notes\nHere are ingredients you'll need for moo deng and some important notes about them. It's super simple! For amounts, see the full [recipe card below](#recipe)\n- White peppercorns\n- Garlic\n- Ground pork, preferably not lean for the best texture.\n- Soy sauce, use\nThai soy saucefor the authentic flavour, but without it, other kinds of soy sauce is also fine. - Fish sauce. See this post on\nchoosing good quality fish sauce. - Sugar\n- A small ice cube, optional.\n- Food processor. Ideally, you'll also need a food processor for the right texture and to get that bounciness, though a small one is fine. If you don't have one, you can still make it and it'll be tasty, but the texture will be more coarse and it won't be bouncy.\nHow to Make Moo Deng\nHere's a bird's eye view of how to make moo deng. Like any other meatballs, you can make these ahead of time and freeze!\n- Pound the garlic and pepper into a paste (not shown). Add the pork, the garlic paste, soy sauce, fish sauce, sugar and a small ice cube into a food processor.\n- Process the pork into a smooth-ish paste - the smoother it is the bouncier the meatballs will be. Without a food processor just knead all ingredients well together well with your hand.\n- Roll them into little balls with gloved hands. Without gloves, wetting your hands will prevent the pork from sticking to your hands.\n- Cook them in boiling water for about 2 minutes or until cooked through. Fish them out, and they're now ready to be added to any noodle soup or any dish you want, or you can freeze them for another day.\nPro Tip: Save the Cooking Water.\nAfter cooking the meatballs, the cooking water is also going to have lots of flavour in it, and it can be used as a base for many Thai soups, especially noodle soups. So if you're making moo deng for noodle soups, definitely keep this water for your soup. And for more ideas, here are my Thai soup recipes.\nStorage and Advance Prep\nMoo deng is a great thing to have in your fridge/freezer as they make for easy and delicious protein for a weeknight meal. Here are a few options for prepping moo deng ahead of time.\n- Cook the moo deng off and then freeze them fully cooked. Then simply boil them for a few minutes to reheat and add to your meal.\n- Make the pork mixture, roll them into balls, and then freeze them raw. If you don't have time to cook them before freezing, you can freeze them raw, but this is a little more work as you'll need to freeze them on a tray without them touching, then consolidated the frozen meatballs into a container. When ready to cook, you can thaw them first or boil them directly from frozen.\n- Make the pork mixture in advance and keep in the fridge for a few days. If you don't have time to roll and cook them, but you want to get ahead a little, you can just mix the meat mixture and keep it in the fridge up to 2 days ahead of time (assuming your ground pork is fresh!). You can freeze the meat mixture, but freeze it in a flat disc so it won't take much time to thaw.\nWhat Dishes Can You Put Moo Deng In?\nMoo deng is not a standalone dish, as you can probably tell, though to be honest if you cook them up and serve them with nam jim seafood or sweet chili sauce, it would make a fantastic appetizer! But here are a few dishes you can serve moo deng in.\n- As per the photo, you can make the\nviral mama tom yum instant noodles. - They're great in\ngaeng jued, a staple comforting Thai soup that most families make regularly, especially families with kids! - Any clear broth noodle soup, such as this\nclassic Thai street style noodle soup. Easy congee, the ultimate breakfast in Asia.- You can go rogue and add them to non-Thai dishes - they'd be great in a pasta!\nExplore my Thai soup recipes for more ideas, and really, add them to anything you can imagine!\nMoo Deng Recipe - Thai Bouncy Pork Meatballs\nIngredients\n- ¼ teaspoon white peppercorns\n- 1 clove garlic\n- 9 oz ground pork, preferably not lean\n- 1 tablespoon\nsoy sauce - 1 teaspoon\nfish sauce - 2 teaspoons sugar\n- 1 small ice cube, optional\nCheck Out Ingredients and Kitchen Tools I Use\nAll my recipes come with step-by-step video tutorials with extra tips not mentioned in the blog post, so make sure you watch the video to ensure success. If you enjoy them, consider subscribing to the YouTube Channel to not miss an episode. Thank you!\nSubscribe to my YouTube Channel\nInstructions\n- Bring a pot of water to a boil for cooking the meatballs. Meanwhile, pound the garlic and peppercorns into a paste in a mortar and pestle. Alternatively, finely grind the pepper and grate or press the garlic into a paste.¼ teaspoon white peppercorns, 1 clove garlic\n- Add the ground pork into a food processor and add the pepper and garlic paste, all of the seasonings, and a small ice cube. Blitz until the pork resembles a paste, which should only take 15-20 seconds. It does not have to be super smooth. Scrape down sides as needed.*If you don't have a food processor, simply knead all meatball ingredients together well with your hand. The texture of the meatball will be rougher, but it'll still be tasty.9 oz ground pork, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 teaspoon fish sauce, 2 teaspoons sugar, 1 small ice cube\n- With gloved hands, roll the pork into balls, about ½-inch in diameter. If you don't have gloves, wet your hands to prevent the pork from sticky to your hands.\n- Once the water is boiling, add the meatballs into the boiling water and cook for 2 minutes or until fully cooked. Remove with a wire skimmer and it's now ready to be added to all kinds of dishes, especially noodle soups!\nWatch my videos AD-FREE and get bonus content on Patreon!\n@hotthaikitchenon Instagram and Twitter!",

The incident occurred at a checkpoint along the Maiduguri – Dikwa- Gamboru road following a misunderstanding between the soldier and the truck driver on Boxing Day. The spokesman for the 7 Division, Lt. Col. A.Y. Jingina, who confirmed the development in a statement on Thursday in Maiduguri, said the army had commenced an investigation into the accident after receiving a complaint from the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW). He said: “Furthermore, engagement has been established with NURTW towards a peaceful resolution of the incident. “The Division has assured both the family of the deceased and the NURTW of its commitment to ensure that justice is served to the family and no stone would be left unturned in this regard. “In the Division’s effort towards ensuring that the family of the victim gets justice, the soldier in question has been arrested, and an investigation has commenced. “It’s also worthy to mention that the Division does not tolerate any form of unprofessional conduct from any personnel as we operate within the ambit of the law. “The Division wishes to once again reassure the members of the general public that we will remain resolute and professional in the joint effort to tackle insecurity in Borno State.” ",

    "title": "Indian F-1 visa applicants: Reveal all social media usernames from 5 years | Immigration News - Business Standard",
    "text": "Indian students applying for a US student visa will now face stricter screening requirements, with consular staff warning of possible denials if social media details are left out of the visa form. The US embassy in India posted on X on Thursday, “Visa applicants are required to list all social media usernames or handles of every platform they have used from the last 5 years on the DS-160 visa application form. Applicants certify that the information in their visa application is true and correct before they sign and submit.” In the same thread, the embassy cautioned that, “Omitting social media information could lead to visa denial and ineligibility for future visas.” Privacy settings must be public Earlier this week, on June 23, the embassy issued another notice specifically for student and exchange visa categories. “Effective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media accounts to public to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States under US law,” it said in a post. This advisory follows the resumption of F-1 student visa processing in India after a brief suspension earlier this month. The restart comes with more intensive background checks, including a closer look at online presence. DS-160 form must now be submitted before booking slots In another procedural change, applicants now have to complete and submit the DS-160 form before scheduling an appointment. Previously, it was possible to book an interview slot and then finish the form later. That has now been reversed. “The recent updates to the US visa application process, particularly concerning the DS-160 form and appointment scheduling, are designed to enhance the overall efficiency and security of the system,” said Varun Singh, managing director at XIPHIAS Immigration, speaking to Business Standard. “By requiring applicants to complete the DS-160 form prior to scheduling an appointment, the US Department of State ensures that consular officers have access to accurate and complete information ahead of interviews.” DS-160 barcode number must match appointment Applicants also need to double-check that the barcode number on the DS-160 confirmation page matches the number used to book the appointment. If there’s a mismatch, they’ll be turned away from the interview and must reschedule using the correct form. This correction cannot be made by consular staff. “It’s important for applicants to ensure that the DS-160 confirmation number matches the one used to schedule their appointment,” said Singh. “If discrepancies are found, applicants will need to reschedule their appointments using the correct DS-160 barcode number, as consular sections cannot modify or update these numbers on behalf of applicants.” What’s changed for Indian F-1 visa applicants • Must list all social media usernames from past 5 years on DS-160 • F, M, J visa applicants asked to keep profiles public for vetting • DS-160 must be submitted before scheduling appointment • Barcode on form must match booking or interview will be cancelled • Applicants must reschedule if details don’t match; embassy can’t fix it Why the changes matter • Cuts down on fake or duplicate bookings by requiring completed forms first • Allows consular officers to review full data ahead of interview • Reduces last-minute mistakes in application details • Aims to prioritise serious and eligible applicants for limited interview slots Don't miss the most important news and views of the day.
