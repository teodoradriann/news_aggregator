    "text": "Thank you for reading this post, don't forget to Share! A member of Israel’s war cabinet broke ranks by declaring that only a ceasefire agreement will help secure the release of the hostages. Former army chief Gadi Eisenkot cast doubt on the terrorist group’s strategy of subduing Gaza and trying to eliminate its rulers, saying: “Whoever talks about absolute defeat [of Hamas] He is not telling the truth. The opposition politician’s comments were a veiled attack on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s policies. On Thursday, Netanyahu dismissed the US view that Israel’s military action should lead to the creation of a Palestinian state. He said Israel “must have security control over all territory west of the Jordan River,” adding: “That conflicts with the idea of [Palestinian] sovereignty.’ Former army chief Gadi Eisenkot questions the strategy of subduing Gaza Eisenkot told Israel’s Channel 12: “The hostages will only return alive if there is an agreement, linked to a significant pause in the fighting.” In the photo: Gaza City on January 6. Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the US view that Israel’s military action should lead to the creation of a Palestinian state. Yesterday, the UK Foreign Office said: “A two-state solution, with a viable and sovereign Palestinian state living alongside a safe and secure Israel, is the best path to lasting peace.” Eisenkot told Israel’s Channel 12: “The hostages will only return alive if there is an agreement, linked to a significant pause in the fighting.” He said this would have to be “three or four times” longer than the week-long pause in fighting in November, which saw a limited release of hostages. He added that stating that they can be released by other means “is spreading illusions.” Eisenkot, whose 25-year-old son Gal was killed in the conflict last month, called for elections to be held soon so Israelis could deliver their verdict. He said: “Israel needs to ask itself… ‘How do we continue from here with a leadership that has failed us miserably?’",

    "title": "RFK Jr. to Cut 10,000 Jobs Across HHS",
    "text": "RFK Jr. to Cut 10,000 Jobs Across HHS\nThe announcement by the Department of Health and Human Services highlighted a flurry of moves, which also include the shifting of departments. Also this week, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. tapped fellow vaccine critic David Geier to investigate vaccine safety within the CDC.\nSecretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is downsizing the department he oversees, with some 10,000 jobs on the chopping block. The plans were initially reported by The Wall Street Journal, citing official documents it had reviewed, with confirmation from HHS later Thursday morning.\n“Over time, bureaucracies like HHS become wasteful and inefficient even when most of their staff are dedicated and competent civil servants,” Kennedy said in the announcement.\nThe cuts come hand-in-hand with reorganizations and consolidation. HHS is creating what it calls the Administration for a Healthy America (AHA), which will house already existing divisions like the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).\nThere are a multitude of other moves. One is shifting the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), a part of HHS responsible for responding to public health emergencies, to the Centers for Disease Control. Another is the creation of a new position, the Assistant Secretary for Enforcement, who will oversee HHS’ appeals board, Medicare hearings, and the Office for Civil Rights.\nWhile the HHS announcement made no mention of it, WSJ‘s initial reporting suggested layoffs within over divisions. According to WSJ, 3,500 staff at the FDA will be let go, 2,400 employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1,200 at the National Institutes of Health and 300 from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\nThe documents, however, indicated that essential services would be unaffected, per the WSJ .\nAccording to the WSJ, the cuts are in line with Kennedy’s push to centralize several functions across the HHS that previously had been assigned throughout its different departments and branches. These include human resources, policy planning and communications. In turn, these structural changes could affect the independence of major health agencies, such as the FDA and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\nThe new cuts add to the approximately 10,000 HHS employees that have already voluntarily stepped down from their roles since January, when President Donald Trump was sworn into office, according to the WSJ. That would mean HHS would be down to around 62,000 employees—a 25% reduction in headcount.\nThe announcement follows reports that Kennedy has tapped David Geier to look at vaccine safety data within the CDC, according to the Washington Post. Geier, who is not a medical doctor, has long asserted that certain components of vaccines could increase the risk of autism—claims that have been debunked by years’ worth of scientific literature.\nIn 2011, the Maryland State Board of Physicians punished Geier for practicing without a medical license.\nKennedy assumed leadership of HHS last month, bringing with him a long history of criticizing, without evidence, not just the safety and utility of vaccines, but also the alleged and unproven “corruption” at the Department, which he vowed to “clean up,” according to a November 2024 post on X welcoming Trump’s nomination. Kennedy wrote at the time that he will “free the agencies from the smothering cloud of corporate capture.”",

    "text": "CIUDAD DEL VATICANO.- El papa Francisco descansó anoche, pero aún necesitaba oxígeno en la mañana del domingo, según informaron fuentes vaticanas.\nEl Vaticano comunicó que el papa pasó una noche tranquila, pero al igual que el sábado cuando tuvo una crisis respiratoria también este domingo tuvo que seguir con oxígeno suministrado con cánulas nasales.\nDebido a las dificultades para respirar, el papa tiene más dolor que los últimos días, precisaron las fuentes, mientras que más información se comunicará en el parte médico previsto esta tarde.\nFrancisco, hospitalizado en el hospital Gemelli desde el 14 de febrero con una neumonía bilateral, pasó una noche tranquila y descansó después de que este sábado se agravase su estado al sufrir una crisis respiratoria por la que se le tuvo que suministrar oxígeno, así como requirió transfusiones de sangre debido a una anemia.\nEste sábado se comunicó que “el estado del Santo Padre continúa siendo crítico” y que “por el momento está en pronóstico reservado”.\nEl papa había presentado una crisis respiratoria asmática prolongada, que requirió también la aplicación de oxígeno de alto flujo”, explicó el parte médico difundido este sábado por la tarde. Oxígeno que ha tenido que continuar suministrándose también hoy.\nAdemás añadía que “los análisis de sangre realizados hoy también revelaron trombocitopenia (plaquetas en sangre en cantidad inferior al normal), asociada a la anemia, que requirió la administración de transfusiones de sangre”.\nMientras tanto en Vaticano continúan los actos del Jubileo y se celebrará el dedicado a los diáconos y en sustitución del papa Francisco oficiará la misa en la basílica de san Pedro el pro-prefecto del dicasterio para la Evangelización, Rino Fisichella.\nEl Vaticano también difundió el texto del rezo del ángelus escrito por el papa en el que explicó que “continua con confianza” la hospitalización en el Policlínico Gemelli, “siguiendo con los tratamientos necesarios” y añadió que “el descanso también forma parte de la terapia”.\n“Agradezco de corazón a los médicos y al personal sanitario de este hospital por la atención que me están demostrando y por la dedicación con la que realizan su servicio entre las personas enfermas”, añadió el papa en su mensaje, que cómo el domingo pasado fue difundido sin que se celebrase el ángelus para que el pontífice pueda descansar.\n“En estos días me han llegado muchos mensajes de afecto y me han impresionado especialmente las cartas y dibujos de los niños. ¡Gracias por esta cercanía y por las oraciones de conforto que he recibido de todo el mundo! Encomiendo a todos a la intercesión de María y les pido que recen por mí”, añadió Francisco.\nEFE.",
