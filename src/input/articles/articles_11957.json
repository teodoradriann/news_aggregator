    "title": "Tory MP says he misspoke after NDP MP accuses him of making anti-Indigenous comment",
    "text": "OTTAWA — A Conservative MP apologized in the House of Commons on Thursday after an Indigenous colleague from across the political aisle called him out for linking an offender's criminal record to his race.\nBrad Redekopp says he misspoke earlier this week when he brought up the 2022 mass stabbings in Saskatchewan during a debate about measures to address systemic racism within the RCMP.\nOn Tuesday, the Saskatoon MP criticized parole officers for releasing Myles Sanderson on parole before the James Smith Cree Nation member perpetrated the killings.\nHe incorrectly suggested that the parole board predicted Sanderson \"was likely to reoffend because of his racial background.\"\nThe Conservative party sought to correct the record — not by striking the claim altogether but by changing it to say \"regardless\" of his racial background, instead of \"because\" of his racial background.\nIn a statement to The Canadian Press, Redekopp said he misspoke, and \"proactively asked that the record be corrected\" to reflect his intent and \"to avoid any misunderstanding or offence.\"\nWinnipeg MP Leah Gazan said she noticed the change in the House of Commons official record-keeping the next day, and said she expected an apology to follow.\nOn Thursday, Gazan stood in the House of Commons and demanded that he take accountability.\nHe stood in response and delivered an apology.\n\"Once again, I apologize for misspeaking. I never meant to offend anyone. I never meant to cast any aspersions on anyone because of race,\" he said in the House.\nBut Gazan said in the House that she doesn't accept Redekopp's explanation, or the way he apologized.\nShe asked the Speaker to make a ruling that the House of Commons should revert the record back to the original language, arguing that the Conservatives are trying to \"whitewash\" what happened.\n\"I would ask that the member reflect upon this, and I would ask that the official record actually reflect what occurred — what we all heard, and what the member has admitted to having said — rather than being rewritten to avoid accountability and responsibility,\" Gazan said.\nThe matter is under consideration.\n\"What he said in there was hurtful, it was harmful, it was offensive and it was racist,\" Gazan said in an interview earlier on Thursday.\nRedekopp insisted in his written statement that his comment had nothing to do with race, \"only the facts of the case at hand.\"\nAn investigation into the earlier release of Sanderson, who was accused of killing 11 people and injuring 17 others, found the Parole Board of Canada could not have foreseen the worst mass murder in Saskatchewan's history.\nThe National Joint Board of Investigation also found there were \"no pre-incident indicators or precipitating events that were known to staff, or that staff could have acted upon to prevent this incident.\"\nFor Gazan, it's another example of what she calls a pattern of anti-Indigenous rhetoric by Conservative politicians.\nShe listed off several examples.\nEarlier this year, Saskatchewan MP Kevin Waugh apologized after he accused First Nations of burning down water treatment plants because they're frustrated with the Liberals.\nIn 2018, an NDP motion that called on the Pope to apologize for residential schools got overwhelming support in the House of Commons — except from 10 Conservative MPs.\nAnd in 2008, before he was leader of the Conservative party, Pierre Poilievre apologized after saying Indigenous people need to learn the value of hard work more than they need compensation for abuse suffered in residential schools.\nLast year, Poilievre also came under fire for speaking to a Winnipeg-based group that ran radio ads in 2018 that said it was a myth that residential schools robbed Indigenous children of their childhood.\n\"There's a pattern of anti-Indigenous racism that occurs in the House,\" Gazan said, \"and certain members of political parties want to protect the rights and freedoms for some, but not others.\"\nA spokesperson for Poilievre didn't respond to a request for comment.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published June 6, 2024.\nMickey Djuric, The Canadian Press",

    "text": "El titular del Ministerio de Salud, César Vásquez, precisó que pese al rebrote de coronavirus en el país, donde se han identificado los primeros 12 casos del linaje JN.1, no se ha registrado un incremento de hospitalizaciones por la enfermedad. MIRA: [Huancayo: Juan Reynoso y Dina Boluarte son los principales rostros de las piñatas en Año Nuevo (VIDEO)] En ese sentido, el ministro señaló que efectivamente se ha visto un aumento importante de casos covid; sin embargo, estos no han significado un incremento de hospitalizaciones, ingresos a unidades de cuidados intensivos (UCI) o fallecimientos. “Efectivamente, en las últimas semanas ha habido un importante incremento de casos. Hasta noviembre de este año, se diagnosticaban entre 600 a 700 por semana. En este diciembre ya estamos superando los 1.700 casos por semana [...], más o menos el triple de lo que se venía dando; sin embargo, no ha significado un incremento de hospitalizaciones”, expresó durante la conferencia de prensa tras la sesión del Consejo de Ministros. Vásquez indicó que los pacientes hospitalizados, alrededor de 40 por semana en promedio, tienen factores de riesgo como comorbilidades o esquema de inmunización incompleto. “El Covid vino al mundo para quedarse. Nos trajo dolor y muerte en su momento [...] En la actualidad prácticamente todos los ciudadanos tienen la defensa contra este virus, algunos por respuesta natural y otros inducidos por la vacuna”, dijo. “El virus hoy se ha convertido prácticamente en una infección respiratoria más con la que el mundo se ha acostumbrado a convivir y Perú no es la excepción. Estas infecciones virales, en cambios de estación como esta, aumentan; y más aún en tiempos festivos, donde hay mayor aglomeración de gente”, agregó. Cabe precisar que, según el premier Alberto Otárola, de los 4 millones de peruanos considerados en riesgo y “alta vulnerabilidad” a nivel nacional, 3′100,000 han accedido a la vacunación. “Es decir, estamos superando el 75% de cobertura. Esperamos coberturar al 100% en el primer trimestre de 2024, pese a que hay colectivos y un grupo importante en redes que induce a la no vacunación”, precisó.",

The market's growth is predicted to surge from $232.58 billion in 2024 up to $248.35 billion in 2025, boasting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.8%. The growth in the previous period can be credited to governmental incentives and subsidies, diminishing costs in solar technology, heightened environmental consciousness and sustainability, ambitions for energy liberty, and an escalating demand for energy.\nSolar EPC Market Size Forecast: What's the Projected Valuation by 2029?\nIn the forthcoming years, the solar EPC market is anticipated to witness robust growth, reaching $306.38 billion in 2029 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.4%. The projected expansion in the said period can be credited to the emphasis on decentralized energy systems, the initiation of floating solar projects, governmental pledges to renewable energy, the worldwide shift toward clean energy, and heightened consciousness about the environment and sustainability. The forecast period is likely to see emerging trends such as the adoption of bifacial solar technology, the integration of energy storage, digitalization and IoT, establishment of floating solar farms, green funding and sustainable investments, decentralized energy production, and breakthroughs in solar tracking systems.\nView the full report here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/solar-epc-global-market-report\nWhat Are the Drivers Transforming the Solar EPC Market?\nThe acceleration of the solar EPC market is anticipated due to the escalating demand for renewable energy resources. Renewable energy, which comprises of power procured from naturally restocking resources like sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, geothermal heat, and biomass, employs solar EPC for the establishment of solar power operations. Solar EPC incorporates a comprehensive approach encapsulating design, procurement, and construction. Such a methodology curbs costs, assures quality, and streamlines the entire flow, founding it as a crucial element in the advancement and scaling up of renewable power, specifically solar energy. In September 2024, data from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, a governmental agency in the UK, demonstrated that during Q2 2024, renewable energy made up 51.6% of total energy production, showing an elevation of 9.9 per cent points (PP) compared to the same quarter in 2023. Three-quarters of these fresh installations were ascribed to solar PV. Hence, the mounting demand for renewable power resources fuels the growth of the solar EPC market.\nGet your free sample here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/sample.aspx?id=14203&type=smp\nWhat Long-Term Trends Will Define the Future of the Solar EPC Market?\nKey players in the solar EPC sector are keen to expand their renewable energy service offerings by initiating divisions dedicated to utility-scale solar engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC). These divisions are crucial to the implementation of substantial solar energy ventures, ensuring effective design, construction, and commissioning for optimized energy yield. For instance, Jingoli Power, an American solar EPC provider, inaugurated a fresh solar EPC division in September 2022 to enhance its renewable energy services scope.
