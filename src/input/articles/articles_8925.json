    "title": "六七十岁的老爸老妈迷上了\"国学课\"|情绪_新浪财经_新浪网",
    "text": "转自：南湖晚报\n　　N晚报记者 韩瑜超 整理\n　　陆女士：我爸今年70岁，我妈67岁，他们是一对退休教师，清心寡欲了大半辈子，至今仍居住在我出嫁时的那套老房子里。很多老人退休后有自己的兴趣爱好，有的爱锻炼，有的爱旅游，有的爱摄影，有的爱打牌，但我的老爸老妈不一样，生活于他们而言，无非就是三餐四季，平时顶多就在小区里或者附近公园散散步。\n　　我是他们的独生女，如今一家三口生活在广州，我丈夫因为工作的原因，一年之中有至少一半的时间待在香港，所以我们几乎不怎么回来，有几年的春节，我接爸妈来广州待上几个星期。\n　　今年过完春节，我突然发现爸妈身上发生了一些改变，以前我发他们微信，或者打他们视频都是秒回，现在经常出现不能及时回复的情况。而且，在他们的朋友圈里，我经常看到他们正在上的“国学课”的相关内容，有些看起来并不靠谱。\n　　先来说说这所谓的“国学课”，我向社区干部打听了，我爸妈受到了身边的同龄人影响，参加了一场免费讲座，年轻的导师以十分的热情，向他们输出了很多新鲜的观点，同时又结合了传统文化的理念，我爸妈深深地被打动了。\n　　在参加完几次免费课程后，我爸妈不仅获得了满满的尊重感，还得到了大大小小的礼品一堆，于是，他们就对“国学课”产生了好感和信任。上个月底，他们各自交了几千元学费，买了课程，继续学习。\n　　他们还兴致勃勃地对我说，他们这个班上很多是退休教师、企事业单位退休人员，人的层次和素质都不错，他们还交到了不少朋友，仿佛打开了精彩的夕阳生活。我劝说他们，要提高警惕，不要被小礼品这些蝇头小利所骗，也不要被老师给出的情绪价值蒙蔽了双眼。\n　　老爸老妈听了我这话就不开心了：“我和你妈平平淡淡地过了半个多世纪，你是我们唯一的女儿，现在忙于工作无法陪我们，我们退休了、年纪大了，也渴望精神的寄托啊！”听到这里，我的鼻头不禁一酸，隔着手机，我的眼泪吧嗒吧嗒地往下掉，为了不让他们有任何察觉，我假装信号不佳，立刻挂断了语音通话。\n　　随后，我爸发来了一段长长的“小作文”，字里行间还以“不懂传统文化”“不孝”为由批判了我，在我四十多年的人生中，这是第一次和我爸妈出现如此大的裂痕。我哭了很久很久，甚至想回家，陪在父母的身边，但生活的齿轮推着我们每个人滚滚向前，当新一轮太阳升起时，我知道，这是做不到的。\n　　现在，老两口继续参加“国学课”，甚至开始向他们身边的亲友推荐，远在千里之外的我，也没有办法阻止和改变他们。\n　　万姐有话说：老人交几千元参加所谓的“国学课”，很可能是掉入了以“伪国学”为名的诈骗陷阱。关于这方面的报道，已有不少。 骗子们以“0元学”“1元学”为噱头吸引老年人加入微信群或直播课，后续通过各种名义诱导缴费，金额从几千元到数万元不等。在上课的过程中，骗子不断提供情绪价值，让老人们感受到被理解和尊重。老人辨别能力较弱，易被“权威感”和“免费福利”吸引，骗子利用老人对健康、家庭运势的担忧，实施诈骗。你远在千里之外，但可以每天打电话或通过微信和父母沟通，如果老人喜欢上国学课，你可以帮他们挑选有资质的正规机构去上课。平时也可以多转发一些相关案例给父母，提醒他们别上当受骗，或者请社区工作人员上门，帮老人辨别真伪。",

    "text": "A former mutual fund rep was fined and banned after a regulatory hearing panel found she borrowed from a client. A panel of the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) imposed a permanent ban on Omadai (Amy) Sukhai, a former rep with PFSL Investments Canada Ltd. in Toronto, and ordered her to pay a fine of $213,509 and $10,000 in costs after finding that she violated the self-regulatory organization’s rules. The sanctions follow a disciplinary hearing that found Sukhai borrowed money from a client, which wasn’t disclosed to her dealer, and resulted in a conflict of interest that wasn’t resolved in the client’s best interests. According to the SRO’s allegations, Sukhai began borrowing money from a client in 2017, taking a series of payments that ultimately totalled almost $140,000. The client, a retired widower, redeemed funds from his RRSP — paying deferred sales charges and taxes — in order to lend the money to Sukhai, the SRO alleged. CIRO also stated the widower took a cash advance from a credit card to loan money to his advisor. “[Sukhai] deposited some or all of the amounts that she obtained from [the] client into her personal bank accounts, and used the monies to pay her personal expenses,” the SRO alleged, adding that she did not repay the loans. Sukhai’s firm terminated her in May 2021 after the misconduct was discovered. The reasons for the panel’s decision have not yet been released.",

    "text": "By Michael Katz | Friday, 08 March 2024 09:47 PM EST For the first time as a member of NATO, Sweden is participating in a military exercise, and members of its armed forces told Newsmax they were glad finally to be a part of the Western military alliance. On Thursday, Sweden became the 32nd member of NATO, two years after it applied following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The once-neutral nation is participating in Nordic Response, a training exercise involving more than 20,000 soldiers from 14 countries, including the U.S., which began Monday in the Arctic extremes of Norway, Finland, and Sweden and runs through March 14. \"Sweden joined NATO this week, and it's really good,\" a member of Sweden's armed forces told Shelby Wilder in an exclusive Newsmax report Friday from Alta, Norway, north of the Arctic Circle. \"We've done many NATO exercises before, but now we are a real member and it feels really good.\" Wilder reported that Nordic Response is a crucial part of one of NATO's most extensive military drills since the Cold War. \"These exercises are happening in close proximity to the Russian border,\" Wilder reported. \"As NATO demonstrates a united front, it's sending a clear message to the Kremlin, which is taking note.\" The Barents Observer, a Norwegian media outlet, reported Wednesday that Russia will be monitoring the exercises and that Aleksandr Grushko, its deputy defense minister, called the exercises \"demonstrative and provocative.\" About NEWSMAX TV: NEWSMAX is the fastest-growing cable news channel in America!

    "title": "EV charging hubs demand visionary architecture",
    "text": "Accelerating the transition to the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is a fundamental step in the journey to Net Zero, and, currently, EV charging is a key area that underdelivers. While the number of charging points are rising (up 47% in the last year in the UK alone), unreliable, slow and uninspiring charge points are the bane of EV drivers’ lives. Significant infrastructure gaps persist, but these well-documented issues challenge us to think differently, reject the status quo and create another way.\nThe opportunity now is to be bold, with an innovative approach that creates an enticing consumer experience, while utilising the latest innovations in smart technology and artificial intelligence to deliver a holistic approach to the husbandry of energy. With their daring, space-age aesthetics, fuel stations of the 1950s and 1960s represented the promise of an exciting and dynamic future. Now, as we stand on the cusp of another technological leap forward, visionary architecture for EV charging stations should stimulate interest, generate enthusiasm and provide a sense of optimism.\nThe solarpunk movement is a striking inspiration for this new architectural approach, promising a tantalising concept of futuristic utopias that integrate ‘green’ technology with building designs inspired by and connected harmoniously to nature. With sustainability and optimism at its core, solarpunk shuns climate doomerism, and when applied to EV charging hubs, has the power to reward consumers with visually and culturally captivating spaces to recharge their vehicles and, just as importantly, themselves. Along with charging, these attractive and enriching spaces should drive community engagement and provide a sense of belonging—other solarpunk ideals —as well as inspire pivotal change.\nThe solarpunk movement is inspiring a new architectural approach, promising a concept of futuristic utopias that integrate ‘green’ technology with building designs inspired by and connected harmoniously to nature Respecting the fact that charging an EV takes longer than filling an internal combustion engine vehicle, imaginative, inspiring spaces, specifically tailored for drivers can enthrall and entertain, delivering on the promise of a net zero future similar to that of the futuristic, confident designs of the Atomic Age. The difference now is that the solarpunk movement is not just an aesthetic but a real commitment to bringing technology, design and nature together. Its duty is not just to enhance the visual and emotional experience but to also positively impact and influence the biodiversity and natural environment that it inhabits, weaving the new infrastructure harmoniously into the local environment.\nRenewable energy is key to the ‘solar’ aspect of the solarpunk philosophy. Harvested solar power energy at these new high-power charging hubs can be gathered and stored in on-site batteries. Nothing goes to waste. It’s true energy husbandry, relieving pressure on strained electricity grids where infrastructure gaps remain.\nImaginative, inspiring spaces, specifically tailored for drivers can enthrall and entertain\nIntegrating innovative and smart technology, and designing with nature to deliver a significantly richer, engaging and enticing infrastructure vision is fundamental to fostering and stimulating attitudinal shifts, accelerating the transition to EVs.\nThe future is not gas stations for electricity, but something very different, more exciting and much better. A new and exhilarating reimagining—a positive experience for drivers making the move to EV charging has the potential to be transformative.\nOn a wider level, strikingly elegant and energy-efficient infrastructure holds great power to both stimulate and shift public perception of all sustainability initiatives and technologies. It should inform and delight, reinforcing the positive environmental—and emotional—messages around a hopeful and confident future. There is still much to be done to relieve climate anxiety, but paradigm shifts such as this can accelerate us along the path to reverse climate damage with a sense of hope, purpose and optimism.",

    "text": "Editoriali\nLa resa del governo sulla salute\nGli emendamenti al ddl Prestazioni sanitarie presentati dalla maggioranza non solo mancano di visione, ma sembrano espressione di una progressiva resa nella gestione del Ssn. Non si costruisce una sanità più forte delegando all’esterno le sue funzioni\nGli emendamenti al ddl Prestazioni sanitarie presentati dalla maggioranza in commissione Affari sociali alla Camera non solo mancano di visione, ma sembrano espressione di una progressiva resa nella gestione del Ssn. Più che rilanciare il sistema, si assiste a una sua progressiva frammentazione, con la delega di intere funzioni fondamentali a soggetti terzi. Un outsourcing mascherato da riforma, che tradisce l’incapacità di affrontare le criticità del sistema. Ne è un esempio la scelta di affidare a medici a gettone le attività del Pronto Soccorso. Discutibile anche la proposta di spostare le prestazioni ambulatoriali nelle farmacie facendole diventare impropriamente dei piccoli ospedali. E ancora, l’obbligo previsto per tutti gli specializzandi di lavorare per un anno in Pronto Soccorso durante il corso di formazione, preoccupandosi più di colmare a basso costo – senza stanziare alcuna risorsa aggiuntiva per i loro straordinari – i buchi di organico più che di formare adeguatamente i giovani professionisti.\nA questo si aggiunge il rischio di scatenare una guerra tra poveri con la proposta di togliere a tutti i medici i fondi contrattuali per il trattamento accessorio destinato alla valorizzazione della carriera dei professionisti per gli anni 2025 e 2026 per darli esclusivamente al personale dell’emergenza-urgenza e delle reti tempo-dipendenti.\nInfine, l’ennesima stretta proposta sull’attività intramoenia che sembra più dettata da pulsioni ideologiche che da dati oggettivi. I numeri dimostrano che la libera professione non incide in modo significativo sulle liste d’attesa, rappresentando solo una piccolissima quota delle prestazioni erogate nel pubblico.\nAnzi, costituisce un’opportunità regolata, fiscalmente controllata e utile anche alle casse delle aziende sanitarie, che ricevono ogni anno centinaia di milioni in entrate aggiuntive. Queste proposte di modifica sono state accompagnate dalle proteste dei sindacati medici che hanno già minacciato lo stato di agitazione in caso di loro approvazione. Non si costruisce un Ssn più forte delegando all’esterno le sue funzioni o puntando il dito contro chi ogni giorno ne garantisce il funzionamento.",

    "text": "Valle Deforestación en el Valle se redujo en más del 56 % en 2023; planean reforestar 12 millones de árboles El Valle del Cauca es uno de los departamentos que reportó cifras favorables en el país, donde la disminución fue del 36 %. [Por: Redacción El País](/autor/redaccion-el-pais/) El Valle del Cauca logró, en 2023, una disminución en la deforestación del 56,5 % comparado con el año inmediatamente anterior, lo que consolidó al departamento como uno de los que menos reporta esta actividad que atenta contra la naturaleza. El anuncio fue realizado por la CVC, [ la cual detalló que mientras en 2022 fueron deforestadas 579 hectáreas en el departamento, el año pasado la cifra bajó a las 223 hectáreas.](https://www.elpais.com.co/cali/cual-es-el-desarrollo-que-se-imaginan-los-gobernadores-del-pacifico-colombiano-con-sus-planes-de-desarrollo-1725.html) “Eso es gracias a todo el ejercicio que hemos hecho de la mano con las comunidades negras, indígenas, campesinas, nuestros empresarios, organizaciones ambientalistas y nuestro programa Valle más Verde con la siembra de 8 millones de árboles. Todo este ejercicio se está viendo reflejado hoy y es por eso que estamos por encima del promedio nacional en disminución de áreas deforestadas”, contó Marco Antonio Suárez, director de la CVC. De acuerdo con el Ministerio de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sostenible, [la deforestación en Colombia en 2023 se redujo en un 36 %, alcanzando la cifra más baja de esta actividad desde que se tiene registro. ](https://www.elpais.com.co/colombia/procuraduria-alerto-por-grave-deforestacion-en-la-amazonia-y-le-pidio-al-gobierno-hacerse-cargo-de-su-proteccion-1653.html)Aún así, el Valle estuvo más de 20 puntos por encima de ese promedio de disminución. Adicionalmente, la gobernadora del Valle, Dilian Francisca Toro, contó que se planea complementar ese esfuerzo con un gran programa de reforestación, en el que se siembren 12 millones de árboles durante los próximos tres años y medio con la ayuda de aliados públicos y privados. “Somos el departamento que más reforesta, en los últimos ocho años hemos sembrado cerca de 20 millones de árboles. Esto demuestra nuestro compromiso con el desarrollo sostenible y la conservación del medio ambiente, incluido en el Plan de Desarrollo del departamento”, sostuvo. Inversión extranjera en el país La ministra de Ambiente, Susana Muhamad, anunció la llegada de $ 47.000 millones desde la Unión Europea para luchar contra la deforestación en el país. [“Este apoyo presupuestario fortalece nuestra estrategia de contención de la deforestación y también la posibilidad de generar una nueva economía basada en la biodiversidad en el año de la COP16 en Colombia”,](https://www.elpais.com.co/cali/sembraran-cerca-de-12000-arboles-este-5-de-mayo-en-el-sector-de-cristo-rey-conozca-como-participar-0452.html) explicó la ministra. Por su parte, Gilles Bertrand, embajador de la Unión Europea en Colombia, señaló que los bosques son esenciales para la preservación de la vida y los equilibrios climáticos mundiales, incluyendo a Europa. “Compartimos con Colombia la ambición de detener la pérdida de biodiversidad y llegar a la carbononeutralidad en 2050, y solo lo lograremos con alianzas cada vez más estrechas. Este apoyo respaldará a Colombia en la implementación de la ley de delitos ambientales para llevar a la justicia a los financiadores de la deforestación”, dijo. Cifras en los municipios del Valle De acuerdo con la CVC, los municipios del Valle que presentaron mayor deforestación en el 2023 fueron Buenaventura, Tuluá y Bolívar, con un 87,5, un 67,7 y 34,5 hectáreas deforestadas, respectivamente. Por ello, en estos se enfocarán las estrategias contra este flagelo y se impulsará la siembra de árboles. “Tenemos que seguir hasta que no exista más deforestación en el Valle del Cauca”, manifestó Marco Suárez.",

    "text": "Este domingo un río atmosférico impactará en la España peninsular y habrá lluvias abundantes en estas regiones\nSe confirma el cambio de tiempo que venimos anunciando en los últimos días, y fin de semana llegará un río atmosférico desde el Atlántico, coincidiendo con las Cabalgatas, que reforzará las precipitaciones en varias zonas de España.\nLa llegada en el día de hoy de un sistema frontal por el tercio norte peninsular marca un cambio de tendencia en lo meteorológico tras unas cuantas jornadas en las que han predominado las nieblas y heladas, algunos de los efectos más notorios de las altas presiones. En estas próximas jornadas llegarán aún cambios más importantes, coincidiendo con las Cabalgatas y el día de Reyes.\nHoy un frente se abrirá paso entre las altas presiones\nAunque hoy hemos vuelto a levantarnos con brumas y nieblas localmente engelantes en algunos valles de ambas mesetas, depresión del Ebro y llanuras del nordeste, son menos densas y persistentes que en días anteriores. Además, las heladas han sido menos extensas.\nEn la mitad norte se está notando ya un aumento de la nubosidad, sobre todo en el Cantábrico y Galicia, con precipitaciones persistentes y localmente fuertes, con acumulados significativos en el litoral atlántico gallego.\nLas precipitaciones también se extenderán al cuadrante noroccidental, puntos de la meseta norte y llegarán a los Pirineos en la segunda parte del día. Caerán en forma de nieve en montañas del extremo septentrional sobre los 2000 m. Mientras tanto, en el resto de la Península y Baleares habrá intervalos de nubes altas, y en Canarias empezará a entrar la calima por las islas orientales.\nLas temperaturas diurnas ascenderán en el valle del Ebro, Galicia, el Cantábrico occidental, las mesetas, la fachada mediterránea y en el archipiélago canario. Predominarán los vientos del oeste y suroeste moderados en el litoral, con rachas fuertes en Galicia.\nMañana será una jornada de transición: se esperan lluvias en estas zonas\nMañana el tiempo estará influenciado por la aproximación de una borrasca al norte de la península, con un frente que llegará al cuadrante noroccidental por la tarde. Todavía se verán nubes bajas matinales en los valles de la meseta sur y del nordeste peninsular, con posibles brumas y nieblas. Por otro lado, en Canarias se esperan algunas nubes altas y polvo en suspensión.\nEl cielo estará más nuboso en la mitad norte y en la vertiente atlántica, con precipitaciones que afectarán al Cantábrico y Galicia, norte de la Ibérica, oeste del Sistema Central y Pirineos. Tras una tregua transitoria, a últimas horas se intensificarán las lluvias en las comarcas del oeste de Galicia. La cota de nieve se situará por encima de los 2000 m a primeras horas.\nPredominará el viento del oeste y suroeste en la Península, con rachas muy fuertes en el litoral gallego y en zonas expuestas de las montañas del noroeste y la Cordillera Cantábrica. El viento de componente sur ayudará a que las temperaturas suban en la mitad norte peninsular, siendo más acusado este repunte en el Cantábrico oriental.\nLos valores nocturnos también aumentarán casi de forma generalizada en la península, y se mantendrán sin cambios en el suroeste y en los archipiélagos. Las heladas seguirán perdiendo extensión e intensidad en el interior de nuestra geografía, afectando localmente a Pirineos y sierras del centro y sureste peninsular.\nEl domingo llegará un río atmosférico al oeste peninsular\nDurante la jornada del domingo, día de Cabalgatas (en varias ciudades se han adelantado a mañana) la borrasca impulsará un río atmosférico procedente del Atlántico que reforzará un frente que cruzará la Península entre el domingo y el lunes, repartiendo precipitaciones en gran parte del país.\nSe trata de una franja larga, estrecha y transitoria en la que se produce un transporte horizontal de vapor de agua, y suele estar asociado a corriente en chorro en bajos niveles por delante de un frente frío de una borrasca. El vapor de agua en los ríos atmosféricos es suministrado por fuentes de humedad tropicales y/o extratropicales.\nEstas serán más fuertes y persistentes en el oeste de Galicia y del Sistema Central, así como en el entorno del Estrecho. Se irán extendiendo a toda la vertiente cantábrica, Castilla y León, Extremadura, Andalucía, Comunidad de Madrid y Huesca. Serán en forma de nieve en zonas altas de la Cordillera Cantábrica y los Pirineos, con una cota que irá cayendo hasta los 1500 metros.\nLas temperaturas mínimas no sufrirán grandes cambios en general, con algunos aumentos por el suroeste. Continuará el retroceso de las heladas, registrándose localmente algunas en los Pirineos y sierras del centro y sudeste peninsular. Los valores diurnos subirán ligeramente en ambas mesetas y el valle del Guadalquivir, descendiendo en la depresión del Ebro, el Sistema Ibérico y el sudeste.\nEl viento seguirá predominando del oeste y suroeste en la Península y Baleares. Se prevén posibles rachas muy fuertes en el área mediterránea, cuadrante nordeste y zonas montañosas del tercio este peninsular. Por otra parte, en Canarias el viento será flojo en general, habrá algunas nubes altas y seguirá la calima.\nEl lunes, día de Reyes, el tiempo seguirá borrascoso, sobre todo en la primera mitad del día, cuando seguirán produciéndose precipitaciones en buena parte de la Península y también en Baleares, siendo menos probables en puntos de la costa mediterránea. Pueden descargar localmente con fuerza en Andalucía, Castilla-La Mancha, Galicia, Sistema Central o Montes de Toledo, mejorando ligeramente la situación a partir del mediodía. Nevará a partir de 1400 m.",
