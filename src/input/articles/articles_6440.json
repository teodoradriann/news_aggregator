    "text": "The actual cast members of the documentary film \"Beyond Utopia\" pose during a press conference held at CGV Yongsan I'Park Mall in Yongsan District, Seoul, Friday. Yonhap\nPastor Kim Sung-eun's rescue efforts highlighted in documentary By Pyo Kyung-min Narrating the harrowing journey of two families escaping North Korea in pursuit of freedom, the documentary film \"Beyond Utopia\" is set to make its long-awaited debut in South Korea later this month.\nThe film illuminates Kim Sung-eun, a pastor who, in the past decade, has rescued over 1,000 North Koreans fleeing their homes in search of improved living conditions. Offering a two-hour glimpse into the actual defection process, the film follows the Roh family and the son of another defector, Lee So-yeon, all aided by Kim.\nTo mark its official release, a premiere event on Wednesday welcomed the real-life protagonists, including Kim, Roh's family and Lee, to CGV Yongsan I'Park Mall in Yongsan District, central Seoul. The event also hosted Culture, Sports and Tourism Minister Yoo In-chon, press and some 300 other attendees.\nReflecting on his ongoing efforts, Kim shared that he had rescued seven more North Korean defectors just days before attending the event.\n\"Every walk in the jungle near the Vietnamese border feels like my last, yet I persevere, compelled by the sheer number of individuals reaching out for assistance,\" he said.\nCulture, Sports and Tourism Minister Yoo In-chon, center, talks with the cast after attending the premiere event of \"Beyond Utopia\" at CGV Yongsan I'Park Mall, Yongsan District, Seoul, Wednesday. Yonhap\nAccording to Kim, more than 50,000 North Koreans are currently detained in China, with over 200 people seeking his help.\n\"What constantly drives me to aid them lies in their role as living witnesses, capable of exposing the perils of communism and the dire human rights conditions of North Korea.\"\nThis is why Kim is especially satisfied with the South Korean release of \"Beyond Utopia.\"\n\"Currently, in China, providing assistance to North Korean defectors is illegal; people are thrown in jail for helping them. The Chinese government, which should be speaking up about North Korean human rights issues, maintains a deliberate silence,\" he said.\n\"My hope is for this film to serve as a catalyst in enlightening not only the South Korean people but also the whole world on these matters, ultimately contributing to enhancing human rights for North Koreans.\"\nCulture, Sports and Tourism Minister Yoo In-chon, left, claps during a premiere event of \"Beyond Utopia,\" held at CGV Yongsan I'Park Mall, Yongsan District, Seoul, Wednesday. Yonhap\nDirected by American filmmaker Madeleine Gavin, the documentary is a contender for the 96th Academy Awards' Documentary Feature Film category. It also earned international acclaim with an Audience Award at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival.\nThe film's authenticity was evident at the premiere, with every scene portrayed without exaggeration or distortion. The audience collectively experienced a range of emotions, from empathy to disbelief and gratefulness.\nLee's heart-wrenching story of separation from her son in North Korea moved many to tears with her poignant depiction of motherhood.\nIn a trembling voice, she articulated her \"only wish.\"\n\"Through this movie, I aspire for the harsh reality of North Korea to face widespread criticism and I hope that one day, my son and I may reunite to share a meal together,\" Lee said.\nAlso present were the two young daughters of the Roh family. Roh Jin-hae, the eldest daughter, touched the hearts of those in attendance with her sincere aspirations and gratitude.\n\"I didn't expect such a large turnout,\" she said. \"Observing all of you, I too harbor a dream — to grow into an admirable adult like yourselves, paying close attention to what is right.\"\n\"Beyond Utopia\" will hit local theaters on Jan. 31.\npzzang@koreatimes.co.kr More articles by this reporter",

    "text": "Hic Sunt Dracones presents\nThe NeuroSpice Girls, by Lizzie Tollemache\nWednesday, July 23\n24 Filleul St pop-up space\nReview by BRENDA HARWOOD\nA large and responsive audience gave a warm welcome to Christchurch-based playwright/actor Lizzie Tollemache’s wildly engaging, high-energy exploration of the life-long impact of neurodivergence during last night’s premiere performance of The NeuroSpice Girls.\nDescribed as ‘‘a funny and ferocious neurodivergent odyssey, from gut-punching denial to celebration,’’ the show is directed by Kim Morgan, who also produces through her local theatre company Hic Sunt Dracones (HSD).\nThe NeuroSpice Girls centres on the challenges faced by Tollemache — as a child in the playground, as a teenager and as an adult, when she could finally set about dealing with her issues.\nAlong the way, she shares intimate details — some hilarious and others heartbreaking — of the many times her unique thought processes led to embarrassment, anxiety and punishment.\nAn entertaining and sympathetic performer, Tollemache’s masterful performance is superbly supported by a ‘‘Greek chorus’’ of top notch local actors, Marama Grant, Lexie Tomlinson, Ellie Swann and Destiny Carvell.\nEach with their own stories of neurodivergence and challenges, the chorus help keep the energy levels high and add immensely to the show’s frequent moments of hilarity with impeccable comic timing — especially during satiric moments like the wickedly hysterical ‘‘therapy for the patriarchy’’ sequence. They can really sing as well.\nAlongside its many very funny sequences, The NeuroSpice Girls is filled with relatable moments, such as the triumphant announcement of ‘‘boundaries’’ and the moving sharing of the women’s whakapapa through their mothers, grandmothers and great-grandmothers.\nAn important aspect of the HSD kaupapa is to ‘‘go off the map’’ and find distinctive venues for each of its productions and the space at 24 Filleul St (next to the Urgent Pharmacy), sourced with support from the Dunedin Dream Brokerage, is a real coup.\nClearly, a lot of work has gone into turning the space into a black box theatre, complete with a simple, effective and adaptive set designed and created by Matthew Morgan, into a fantastic performance space. The large, accessible venue has allowed HSD to cater for diverse audiences as well, with sofas, cushions and mats, as well as a ‘‘chill out room’’.\nLighting design by Garry Keirle, sound and music by Matthew Morgan, and tech support by Jordan Wichman enhance the theatricality of the piece, while also minimising potential sensory overload.\nAll in all, HSD’s production of Tollemache’s The NeuroSpice Girls is a triumph, bringing a fresh, informative and thoroughly entertaining approach to an important subject. Congratulations to all involved on a superb show.\nThe NeuroSpice Girls continues at 24 Filleul St until Sunday, with performances at 7.30pm, and also 3pm matinees on Saturday and Sunday.",

    "text": "Next week, the Kiev team will face Galatasaray in the Europa League.\nDynamo Kyiv crushed CSKA 1948 in the last friendly match of the winter training camp in Turkey. The meeting in the city of Belek ended with a score of 1:4.\nIn the first half, Nikolai Shaparenko and Vladislav Vanat scored for the “white-blues”.\nAt the start of the second half, the club from the city of Sofia reduced the deficit thanks to the efforts of Mario Ilievski. However, then the charges of Alexander Shovkovskiy scored twice more – goals were scored by Nazar Voloshin and Vanat, who scored a double.\nFull video of the match CSKA 1948 – “Dynamo”\nThis is the second victory of the day for the “white-blues”, as earlier the Kyivians defeated Slovenian “Maribor” (2:0). Before that, at a training camp in Turkey, “Dynamo” lost to German “Magdeburg” (1:3), won over Romanian FCSB (2:1) and snatched a draw against Polish “Widzew” (1:1).\nOn Tuesday, January 21, Dynamo will play its first official match in 2025. The Kyivans will compete with Turkish Galatasaray in the seventh round of the main stage of the Europa League. After that, on January 30, Shovkovsky's team will finish its European Cup campaign with a match against the Latvian club RFS.\nThese matches will no longer have tournament significance for the Kyivans, because they prematurely lost their chances to reach the Europa League playoffs after six defeats in a row. Currently, Dynamo occupies the last, 36th place in the overall standings of the main round of the Europa League and remains the only participant in the tournament that has not yet scored a single point.\nRecall that the Kyivans went into the winter break as the leader of the Ukrainian Premier League (UPL). “White-blue” (43 points) are 5 points ahead of “Oleksandria” and 10 points ahead of “Shakhtar”, which has a match in hand.\nIn the first match of the “spring” part of the UPL, the Kyiv team will host “Karpaty”. The base date for the matches of the 18th round of the elite division of the Ukrainian championship is February 22.",
