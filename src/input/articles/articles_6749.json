    "text": "Les Ã‰tats-Unis viennent d’annoncer la saisie de PopeyeTools, un marchÃ© noir populaire auprÃ¨s des cybercriminels. Apparue en 2016, la plateforme permettait surtout aux pirates de commercialiser des donnÃ©es personnelles et financiÃ¨res volÃ©es aux internautes. Ã€ lire aussi : [Suite au piratage de Free, une vague Â« massive Â» dâ€™arnaques vise les abonnÃ©s] Des numÃ©ros de carte crÃ©dit volÃ©s Parmi les informations vendues en ligne, on trouve des coordonnÃ©es de carte bancaire ou des coordonnÃ©es de compte bancaire. Vendues Ã des hackers, ces donnÃ©es facilitaient les paiements frauduleux sur les comptes des victimes. Comme le rapporte Bleeping Computer , les cartes compromises Ã©taient vendues autour de 30 dollars l’unitÃ©. Par le biais de PopeyeTools, les voleurs de donnÃ©es pouvaient dÃ©gager des bÃ©nÃ©fices sans devoir exploiter les informations pour orchestrer des cyberattaques ou des arnaques. Sur le marchÃ© noir, on pouvait Ã©galement dÃ©nicher des outils destinÃ©s Ã aider les cybercriminels dans leurs activitÃ©s, comme des modÃ¨les de sites de phishing, des tutoriels pour rÃ©aliser des fraudes financiÃ¨res de A Ã Z, ou des procÃ©dÃ©s pour vÃ©rifier la validitÃ© des donnÃ©es de cartes de crÃ©dit compromises. Le marchÃ© noir se distinguait par ses politiques de remboursement et de remplacements pour les donnÃ©es achetÃ©es qui ne fonctionnaient plus. Avec ces garanties, la plateforme s’est fait un nom auprÃ¨s des pirates en quÃªte de donnÃ©es. 1,7 million de dollars et 227 000 victimes GrÃ¢ce Ã son juteux modÃ¨le Ã©conomique, PopeyeTools est parvenu Ã dÃ©gager un chiffre d’affaires estimÃ© Ã 1 700 000 dollars. Depuis sa crÃ©ation, la plateforme a vendu les donnÃ©es personnelles d’au moins 227 000 personnes. Au cours d’une opÃ©ration d’envergure, les autoritÃ©s amÃ©ricaines ont saisi les trois noms de domaines relayant vers la plateforme criminelle, Ã savoir PopeyeTools.com, PopeyeTools.uk et PopeyeTools.to. Un avertissement indiquant que Â« CE SITE WEB A Ã‰TÃ‰ SAISI Â» dans le cadre d’une opÃ©ration de police intitulÃ©e Naufrage est visible sur les sites. Les marchÃ©s noirs Â« ont Ã©tÃ© saisis par le FBI conformÃ©ment Ã un mandat de saisie dÃ©livrÃ© par le tribunal de district des Ã‰tats-Unis Â», peut-on lire dans l’avertissement. Dans la foulÃ©e, la justice amÃ©ricaine a inculpÃ© les trois administrateurs du marchÃ© noir. AccusÃ© de complot en vue de commettre une fraude et de trafic, le trio n’a pas encore Ã©tÃ© interpellÃ©.Â Un trÃ©sor de guerre de 283 000 dollars en cryptomonnaies a Ã©tÃ© saisi par les enquÃªteurs. La guerre contre les marchÃ©s noirs Au cours des derniÃ¨res annÃ©es, les autoritÃ©s ont fermÃ© plusieurs marchÃ©s noirs consacrÃ©s Ã la vente d’outils de piratage. L’an dernier, la police a dÃ©mantelÃ© Genesis Market , un site qui permettait aux cybercriminels de vendre ou dâ€™acheter des bots numÃ©riques, avant de mettre un terme aux activitÃ©s de 16Shop , une plateforme qui vendait des kits de phishing. Plus rÃ©cemment, les forces de l’ordre ont Ã©galement frappÃ© un grand coup contre BreachForums , le site incontournable pour vendre des donnÃ©es en ligne. Le forum est rapidement revenu d’entre les morts. Il est vite redevenu la plaque tournante des donnÃ©es compromises, avec des mises en vente trÃ¨s mÃ©diatisÃ©es. C’est sur ce site que les donnÃ©es de Free , de SFR, et les dossiers mÃ©dicaux de centaines de milliers de FranÃ§ais ont Ã©tÃ© affichÃ©es. ðŸ”´ Pour ne manquer aucune actualitÃ© de 01net, suivez-nous sur [Google ActualitÃ©s]et Source : Justice.gov",

Departing Gombe State on February 12, 2024, he reached Abuja on February 28, 2024, enduring 16 days of challenging weather conditions. Suleiman's motivation stemmed from his admiration for General CG Musa's leadership qualities, which he believes have notably enhanced the security of lives and property since assuming office. He specifically cited the people-centric approach of the CDS as the driving force behind his decision to show solidarity with the Armed Forces Chief. Rabiu expressed his determination to travel to Abuja to convey his appreciation to the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) for his exceptional leadership, which has resulted in notable successes across various operational areas in the country. He emphasised that his journey serves as evidence of the improved security situation in [Nigeria](https://www.legit.ng/nigeria/), highlighting that previously, such travels would have been hindered by insecurity, particularly in the Northeast region. DHQ welcomes Suleiman Upon arrival, Rabiu was welcomed by Acting Director of Defence Information, Brigadier General Tukur Gusau, Assistant Director of Defence Headquarters Provost, Major Nneka Olima, and Special Assistant to the CDS, Alhaji Hashim Hussaini. Brigadier General Gusau expressed gratitude to the young man for his support of the military, explicitly acknowledging his connection with the Chief of Defence Staff. He reassured the individual of the continued dedication of the CDS to maintaining maximum security in the country. He emphasised that the Armed Forces, led by General Musa, prioritise the welfare of the [people](https://www.legit.ng/people/) and are committed to upholding democratic principles and furthering the goals outlined in the President's Renewed Hope agenda.
