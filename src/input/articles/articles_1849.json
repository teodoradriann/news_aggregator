    "text": "Fr. William Horo\nJesus, the Son of God (Lk. 1:35), became the Lamb of God (Jn.1:39), and on the ‘Good Friday’ he shed his blood on the cross for the sin of the world. (Mt. 26:28) It all began when a young maid (Is 7:14), the Virgin Mary, a Jewish woman, consented to the message of the Archangel Gabriel, saying, “I am the handmaid of the Lord. Let it be done to me according to your word.” (Lk. 1:38) The Son of God was made a man in her womb. The Word of God was made flesh and dwelt among us. (Jn. 1:14) Thus, God incarnated into a human being.\nBorn of Mary, a Jewish woman, Jesus was a Jew by birth. He was circumcised (Lk. 2:21) and practiced all other customs and traditions of the Jewish faith. He celebrated the Jewish Passover feast throughout his life. The Jews celebrate the feast of Passover to remember how they passed over from slavery in Egypt to freedom; it is to commemorate the slavery of Israel in Egypt and their ultimate exodus to freedom. During this feast, they eat unleavened bread with the meat of the lambs. It is because the blood of the lamb has set them free.\nAs the Bible narrates that God had sent Moses to Egypt to lead them to freedom (Ex. 3:10), Moses went to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and demanded the release of the Israelites from his slavery. He said, “Let my people go out of Egypt.” (Ex. 9:1) With God’s help, he brought about nine types of plague in Egypt and pressured the Pharaoh for the release of his people, but the Pharaoh could not be moved. Finally, in the tenth decisive plague, the angel of God came at night and struck down all the firstborn Egyptians, both men and beasts. Pharaoh was moved by the wailing of his people and let the Israelites go. (Ex. 12: 29–32)\nThe Israelites were safe from the decisive plague because they obeyed Moses’ instructions. Moses had told the Israelites that each family had to kill a lamb (Ex. 12:3) and sprinkle its blood on their doorposts. (Ex. 12:7) Seeing the blood, the angel of God did not enter their houses, and thus their firstborn were spared. Before their departure from Egypt, they roasted the meat of the lamb and ate it at night with the unleavened bread because the flour of their bread could not be leavened. They ate it in a hurry, with their loins girded and their sandals on, because that night they had to move out of Egypt. It was their Passover of the Lord. (Ex. 12:11) Thereafter, Passover became one of their annual celebrations.\nJesus has celebrated the Passover feast since his childhood. At the age of twelve, his parents, Mary and Joseph, took him to Jerusalem for the Passover. (Lk. 2:41) As a fervent Jewish adult, Jesus went to Jerusalem for other festivities too, such as Hannukah (Jn. 10:22), an unnamed festival (Jn. 5:1), Shavuot, or Pentecost, etc. And in the year he was executed to death on the cross, Jesus ate his Passover meal on the first day of the unleavened bread, when the Passover lamb was sacrificed. (Mk.14: 12) It was his last supper for the following hour of the day, and he was killed. On the very day the Jews sacrificed their Passover lamb, Jesus was executed on the cross and became the Lamb of God (Jn. 1:29) for his followers. And the day he died became ‘Good Friday’.\nBy becoming the Paschal Lamb, Jesus transcended the meaning of the Jewish Passover. The Jews offered the Passover lambs for forgiveness of their sins. It was their annual reminder of sin. For the Bible says, “It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.” (Hb. 10:4) And that is why Jesus came into the world and died on the cross on the day of the Jewish sacrifice of the Passover lamb; he replaced it and abolished ‘the first in order to establish the second.’ “And it is by God’s will that we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus, one for all.” (Hb. 10:10) This is the reason: the followers of Jesus revere the cross and place it in their churches, homes, and even work places, not for converting others, as alleged at times.\nIt is pertinent to mention here what Jesus did at his last supper. When they were eating, Jesus took a loaf of bread, and after blessing it, he broke it, gave it to his disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is my body.” Then he took the cup, and after giving thanks, he gave it to them, saying, “Drink it all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.” (Mt. 26:26–28) At his Last Supper, Jesus offered his bloodless sacrifice, and in the following hours, he had his bloody sacrifice on the cross. He was buried (Mt. 27:59), and on the third day of his burial, he rose again from the tomb. (Mk. 16:6) The Jewish Passover lamb had freed them from the slavery of Pharaoh, but Jesus, the Lamb of God, freed humankind from sin and its wages, death. (Rom. 6:23) Jesus shed his blood for the remission of sins. (Mt. 26:27–28)\nThen the cross was the Romans’ instrument to carry out the death sentences. The criminals who were served the death sentences were crucified until their deaths. It was a shameful death. Jesus was executed by Pontius Pilate, the fifth governor of the Roman province of Judea, under Emperor Tiberius. As a Roman prefect, Pontius Pilate was granted the power of a supreme judge. He had the sole authority to order a criminal’s execution. He convicted Jesus of treason, though he was found not guilty (Lk. 23:14), because the crowds demanded his crucifixion (Lk. 23:21), and their voices prevailed. (Lk. 23:23) When Pilate saw that he could do nothing but that a riot was beginning, he washed his hands before the crowds, said that he was innocent of Jesus’ blood, and handed him over to them to crucify him. (Mt. 27:24–26) Thus, he died a shameful death.\nHowever, Jesus is the saviour for his followers, as it was announced by the angel of God to Mary, his mother, and Joseph, his poster father. (Mt. 1:21) The Bible says that Jesus saved his people from their sin and death through his suffering, as prophesied by the prophets. For example, the prophet Isaiah said, “He was wounded for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the punishment that made us whole, and by his bruises we are healed.” (Is. 53:5) Prophet Jeremiah said that he was like a gentle lamb that led to the slaughter. (Jer. 11:19) The prophecy was fulfilled in Jesus as he suffered and died on the cross, and thus the cross of Jesus has become a symbol of victory over sin and death for his followers.\nSaint Paul, a converted Jew to Christianity and one of the early preachers of Jesus, was once confronted by the Jews and Greeks, who said that to preach the crucified Christ was a foolish thing to do. To them, he retorted, “The message about the cross is foolish to those who do not believe, but to us who have faith, it is the power of God. You Jews demand signs, and Greeks desire wisdom, but we proclaimed Christ crucified, a stumbling block to the Jews and foolishness to the Greeks. God’s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God’s weakness is stronger than human strength.” (1 Cor. 1:18–25)",

    "text": "BRUSSELS (dpa-AFX) - The recipients of the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award, Svetlana Mojsov, Joel Habener, and Lotte Knudsen, have made significant contributions to medical research through their discovery and development of GLP-1-mimicking drugs.\n'Through their discoveries and dedicated efforts, Habener, Mojsov, and Knudsen have introduced a new era of weight management, dramatically improving the well-being and health prospects for hundreds of millions,' the Lasker Foundation, based in New York City, said Thursday when announcing the awards.\nMojsov and Habener, working at Massachusetts General Hospital in the 1980s, were instrumental in the discovery and study of the GLP-1 hormone. Their colleague, Lotte Knudsen from Novo Nordisk, played a crucial role in developing the first GLP-1-mimicking drug approved for obesity.\nThe Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation recognized the impact of their work on improving health outcomes for individuals affected by excess weight. The foundation also expressed optimism about the potential use of GLP-1 drugs in addressing other health issues, such as fatty liver disease and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's.\nHabener and his team's pioneering work in the 1970s led to the unraveling of the genetic makeup of the hormone glucagon and its connection to blood sugar. During their research, they discovered a hormone resembling glucagon, which was distinct and crucial.\nMojsov, collaborating with Habener, synthesized the active part of GLP-1 and found that it lowered blood sugar and indicated satiety. This discovery paved the way for exploring the potential of GLP-1 in diabetes treatment.\nThe breakthrough in GLP-1 treatments came when Knudsen and her team at Novo Nordisk engineered a slow-release version of a GLP-1-like hormone. This formulation received approval in Europe in 2005 for diabetes treatment and later in 2014 for obesity. Following this success, other pharmaceutical companies, like Eli Lilly, developed their own GLP-1 drugs, further expanding the options for patients.\nCopyright(c) 2024 RTTNews.com.

    "title": "One Piece: Netflix Has Bad News For The Live-Action Series",
    "text": "The live-action Straw Hat Pirates hit the ground floor running when it debuted on Netflix last summer. While there have been more notorious live-action anime adaptations than we can list here, Netflix’s One Piece did what many initially believed would be impossible. Thanks to the creative team on the project, including One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda acting as Executive Producer, the live-action Grand Line was able to attract both original anime fans and newcomers to the shonen franchise. While production on season two has reportedly finished, the streaming service might have some bad news for fans who were hoping to see the series return this year.\nVideos by ComicBook.com\nIn a new update, Netflix released a video that broke down some of the big projects that will be landing on its platform this year, 2025. The list of shows and movies includes the likes of Squid Game Season 3, the final season of Stranger Things, the return of hit series like The Witcher and Wednesday, and more. Unfortunately, of these many announcements, Netflix did not confirm that One Piece season two was set to arrive this year. Also on the live-action anime adaptation front, the same can be said for Avatar: The Last Airbender season two, which also seemingly failed to make the cut for a 2025 release date.\nThe Seas Were Turning In 2024\nDuring last year’s Netflix Geeked Week event, showrunner Matt Owens took to the stage to make some big reveals regarding season two. Perhaps the biggest were the casting of Nico Robin and Crocodile, with actors Lera Above and Joe Manganiello taking on the roles respectively. Unfortunately, Owens avoided hinting at a release window for One Piece season two, making the idea that season two will arrive in 2026 all the more likely.\nWhile the series has confirmed quite a few actors that will be taking on the roles of new heroes and villains alike in season two, there remains a major key component that has yet to be cast. Tony Tony Chopper, arguably the biggest new character to arrive in the second season, has yet to be cast though a behind-the-scenes video hinted at the fact that the future Straw Hat will be made entirely of CG. Considering the fact that Chopper is a reindeer doctor who routinely changes his forms, this makes all the sense in the world.\nSeason 2’s Wild Cast\nIn terms of the expansive cast of new actors joining One Piece’s second season, the roster includes the likes of Daniel Lasker as Mr. 9, Camrus Johnson as Mr. 5, Jazzara Jaslyn as Miss Valentine, David Dastmalchian as Mr. 3, Clive Russell as Crocus, Werner Coetser as Dorry, Brendan Murray as Brogy, Callum Kerr as Smoker, Julia Rehwald as Tashigi, Rob Colletti as Wapol, Ty Keogh as Dalton, Katey Sagal as Dr. Kureha, Mark Harelik as Dr. Hiriluk, Sendhil Ramamurthy as Cobra Nefertari, Charitha Chandran as Vivi Nefertari, Rigo Sanchez as Dragon, Yonda Thomas as Igaram, James Hiroyuki Liao as Ipponmatsu, Sophia Anne Caruso as Miss Goldenweek, Mark Penwill as Chess, and Anton David Jeftha as K.M. thus far.\nWant to stay up to date on the live-action Grand Line?

Por cierto, no es por defender al León, pero éste decía que al principio las cosas iban a ir muy mal con los recortes. Lo que está claro es que Argentina no iba bien, y es un país que ha sido de los mas ricos del mundo, y es donde debería estar.\nSeguro que cuando en el segundo trimestre de 2023 la economía no cayó un 5,1% sino un 5,3% tenemos en artículo en portada de Menéame contando la grave situación que atravesaba aquel país y lo mal que lo estaban haciendo sus dirigentes.
