    "title": "New in 2024: A fresh start for enlisted leadership",
    "text": "Welcome two new faces to enlisted leadership in 2024.\nDavid Flosi, the next chief master sergeant of the Air Force, and Chief Master Sergeant of the Space Force John Bentivegna, who started the job in September, will be the top advocates for more than 261,000 enlisted airmen and guardians — the Department of the Air Force’s largest constituency — as well as key advisers to each service’s four-star boss.\nFlosi (pronounced “floss-ee”) most recently served as the top enlisted airman at Air Force Materiel Command. His selection signals that Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin values his input as a career munitions expert, including a background in nuclear missile maintenance, as the service brings on a new generation of nuclear weapons.\nBentivegna previously worked as the senior enlisted adviser to the Space Force’s chief operations officer. In that role, he oversaw the noncommissioned guardians who help fly military satellites, operate offensive and defensive weapons in orbit and track missile launches around the globe.\nTogether, they’ll look to shape the future of enlisted education, redefine the enlisted corps’ role in an evolving force and push for policies that keep military families happy and healthy.\nFlosi will also oversee the Air Force’s ongoing effort to reshape the enlisted enterprise by growing the lower ranks and slowing promotions to midlevel jobs — a plan that has frustrated many airmen eager to climb the career ladder and earn more money.\nTroops hope the men will seek meaningful change on issues from unit understaffing to dysfunctional computers and IT networks to — of course — beards.\nRachel Cohen is the editor of Air Force Times. She joined the publication as its senior reporter in March 2021. Her work has appeared in the Washington Post, the Frederick News-Post (Md.), Air and Space Forces Magazine, Inside Defense, Inside Health Policy and elsewhere.",

    "text": "Carrie Howell, who lives in rural Georgia, is the mother of a bisexual 13-year-old daughter and a 3-year-old boy whose car seat is his favorite color: pink.\nIf either child comes out as transgender some day, she will not be upset in the slightest.\n“I would get on the phone and start looking for doctors” to support them, said Howell, a 33-year-old automotive technician. “I don’t think there should be any laws restricting gender-affirming care for any age. I don’t. If there were more protections in place, then children would feel more confident about reaching out.”\nDarcy Quimby, 56, a political independent from the Palm Desert, California, area, sees the question as more complicated.\nQuimby said she previously identified as bisexual but today is in a monogamous relationship with a man and thinks the LGBTQ+ community has become too vocal, too prominent, too pushy and too obsessed with sexuality as an identity.\nThere’s now a new queer character “every time you turn on the TV,” she said, and kids are being swept up into thinking that being LGBTQ+ — and transgender in particular— is “just a great new fad.”\n “I find it hard to believe there’s that many transgenders in the world — you know, true transgenders,” Quimby said.\n“There are probably some kids who are truly transgender, but I think it’s more of a phase, and unfortunately this phase has dire consequences with some people who really just realize — ‘Wait, no, I really wasn’t’ — and now it’s irreversible,” Quimby said, referring to bodily changes that can come from things like hormone treatments, which she opposes for children.\nAmericans are deeply divided on issues involving queer children, especially kids who identify as transgender or nonbinary, according to a nationwide poll conducted for the Los Angeles Times by NORC at the University of Chicago. Howell and Quimby were among the poll respondents who agreed to follow-up interviews with reporters.\nFifty-four percent of U.S. adults favor laws to prevent transgender children younger than 18 from receiving gender-affirming care such as surgery or puberty blockers, the survey shows. Forty-four percent oppose such laws.\n...continued swipe to next page « 1 2 3 4 » View full story\n©2024 Los Angeles Times. Visit at latimes.com.

    "title": "Israel’s Security Agency Ignored Warning from Gaza Source About October 7 Attack",
    "text": "Months before the October 7 attack on southern Israel,\nthe Israeli security agency Shin Bet received a warning from one of its sources in Gaza that Hamas was planning to carry out a “big move” shortly after Yom Kippur, which took place on September 25 this year, Israel’s Channel 12 reported.\nThe report said Shin Bet dismissed the warning as insignificant, and the intelligence did not make it to senior officials in the agency or its chief, Ronen Bar. Shin Bet sources said the lack of corroborating intelligence and the fact that the source only recently started talking to the Israeli agency contributed to the tip not being taken seriously, although they also admitted the source was considered highly reliable.\nThe tip was just one of many pieces of intelligence that was ignored or not taken seriously by the Israeli security establishment, which led to Israel failing to prevent the October 7 Hamas attack.\nThe New York Times\nreported in November that Israel had obtained Hamas’s battle plan for the October 7 attack more than a year before it took place, but Israeli military and intelligence officials did not believe Hamas was capable of carrying it out.\nThe Times report said the document Israel obtained “did not set a date for the attack, but described a methodical assault designed to overwhelm the fortifications around the Gaza Strip, take over Israeli cities and storm key military bases, including a division headquarters” and added that Hamas followed the blueprint with “shocking precision.”\nAccording to\nHaaretz, Israeli military officials also ignored warnings from women in the Israeli Defense Forces who worked as “spotters” on the Gaza border. The women spent their days watching surveillance footage and reported unusual Hamas activity for an entire year, but their warnings were not taken seriously.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come under intense domestic pressure due to the intelligence failure and his previous strategy of\n helping prop up Hamas to prevent the creation of a Palestinian state. Polls show the majority of Israelis want him to resign once the Gaza war is over, giving him incentive to keep the massacre going for as long as he can.",
