    "title": "‘I'm in good shape': Biden takes questions about his mental and physical fitness",
    "text": "President Joe Biden vigorously defended his fitness for office in a high-stakes press conference Thursday evening, feeling several questions about his age and calls for him to step aside.\n“I think I’m the most qualified person to run for president,” he said, adding that he believes he is the best candidate to beat former President Donald Trump in November. “I beat him once, and I will beat him again.”\nEarly in the press conference, in a moment that was immediately seized on by his opponent Donald Trump, he flubbed the name of Vice President Kamala Harris.\nBiden defended himself on questions about his health and whether he could continue to work aggressively through another term.\nnews 3 hours ago Biden stumbles over Zelenskyy introduction, calls him ‘President Putin' Decision 2024 8 hours ago Biden says during press conference he's going to ‘complete the job' despite calls to bow out Biden said he has taken three “significant and intense neurological exams,” most recently in February, and would take another one only if his doctors recommend it. “They say I’m in good shape,” he said.\nStill, he lamented that “no one’s going to be satisfied” with whatever medical information he release, suggesting his opponents will find reasons to doubt it.\nThe press conference comes as the embattled president doggedly tries to assuage the public and his own party that after a disastrous debate performance, he has the mental and physical stamina to be commander in chief and defeat Trump.\nIn the two weeks since the debate, Biden has seen several members of his own party call on him to leave the race but Biden insists he isn’t going anywhere.\nFollow live coverage and watch Biden’s press conference on NBCNews.com.\nHe chalked up his “stupid mistake” in last month’s debate to his “full bore” schedule and need to rest more.\n“I’ve just got to pace myself a little bit more. That’s what it was about,” he said in response to a question about reports that he told allies he needed to shorten his schedule. “Where has Trump been? Riding around on his golf cart.”\nHe also cast some blame on his staff for over-scheduling him. “I love my staff but they add things. They add things all the time,” he said, before stopping himself. “I’m catching hell from my wife.”\nLater, though, he acknowledged the demanding nature of the job.\n“If I slow down, I can’t get the job done. That’s a sign that I shouldn’t be doing it. But there’s no indication of that yet, none,” he said.\nHe was asked if he worried about his legacy if he stayed in the race, resisting calls from fellow Democrats to step aside, and ends up losing to Trump.\n“I’m not in this for my legacy. I’m in this to complete the job I started,” the president added.\nStill, Biden made two gaffes Thursday evening alone that are likely to overshadow the message he wanted to send.\nAfter opening remarks, read from a teleprompter, Biden’s first question was about whether he was confident Vice President Kamala Harris could replace him if necessary. Biden conflated her name with his opponent’s.\n“Look, I wouldn’t have picked Vice President Trump to be Vice President, to — think she was not qualified to be president. Let’s start there,” Biden said in response to the first question.\nHours earlier, at the conclusion of a NATO summit in Washington, Biden appeared to confuse the leaders of Ukraine and Russia.\n“Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin,” Biden said as he introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at a on Thursday.\nThe president stepped away from the podium before turning back around and corrected himself. “President Putin? He’s gonna beat President Putin! President Zelenskyy.”\n“I’m better [than Putin],” Zelenskyy joked as he shook Biden’s hand.\nBiden has been the world’s leading champion of Ukraine throughout two years of bloody warfare to turn back an invasion from Russia, led by President Vladimir Putin.\nAt Biden’s last press conference, in February, where the president angrily denounced a special counsel report that called him “significantly limited,” Biden referred to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi as the “president of Mexico.”\nThis article first appeared on NBCNews.com .

    "text": "An Israeli strike targeted the outskirts of the Syrian capital Damascus on Thursday, the Syrian Defense Ministry and state media said, amid the conflict between Israel and Hamas. \"At approximately 23:05 p.m. (20:05 GMT) today, the Israeli enemy carried out airstrikes from the occupied Syrian Golan, targeting targets in the southern region,\" the Defense Ministry said in a statement, without reporting casualties.\n\"Our air defense is intercepting hostile targets in the vicinity of Damascus,\" Syria's official SANA news agency wrote earlier. \"An Israeli attack targeted the outskirts of the capital Damascus,\" state television added. Israel rarely comments on strikes targeting Syria, but it has repeatedly said it would not allow its arch-enemy, Iran, which backs the government of President Bashar al-Assad, to expand its presence there.\nRise in attacks According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the strikes targeted a Syrian air defense position in the southern Sweida area and the vicinity of Damascus International Airport. The attack near the airport came 24 hours after flights resumed, suspended since an Israeli attack in late November just hours after it reopened following similar attacks the previous month, said the London-based NGO, which has a large network of correspondents in Syria.\nIsrael has launched hundreds of airstrikes on its northern neighbor since the start of Syria's civil war in 2011, mostly targeting Iranian-backed forces, including fighters of the Lebanese Ayatollah, as well as Syrian army positions. But it has stepped up its attacks since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas on Oct. 7, as tensions rise in the Middle East.",

    "text": "As temperatures dipped below zero on January 12, leaders from the Woyatan Lutheran Church and Wambli Ska Society were notified that they needed to close their makeshift warming shelter.\nAfter the closure of the Hope Center, several Indigenous nonprofit organizations have come together to provide additional resources for homeless individuals. One of these options was opening the Woyatan Lutheran Church to those in need. The Great Plains Chairman's Tribal Health Board had provided the church with a military-grade warming tent that the group planned on using as an additional shelter. That plan was halted on Friday afternoon when Rapid City administrators issued a stop work notice to organizers.\n“When city staff went to the property to issue an order not to proceed with the use of that tent, it was with the acknowledgment that the permits had not been secured, but that we had a bigger crisis on hand,” said Vicki Fisher, Rapid City Community Development Director. “We have a cold spree that we've not experienced in a long time, and we have a lot of vulnerable people that need to be sheltered. So the message was 'you don't need to take down a tent, just please don't use it.' It is so frigid that the action of trying to heat it would put those people in jeopardy of a fire.”\nPeople are also reading…\nAround 4:30 p.m. Friday, John Olson, escorted by Lieutenant Tim Doyle of the Rapid City Police Department arrived to issue the Stop Work Order. Chris White Eagle, leader of the Lakota Center at Woyatan Lutheran Church, spoke with Olson and Doyle and said he was told that the Pennington County Jail could be used as a temporary shelter if the Cornerstone Mission and Care Campus hit max-capacity.\n“We looked at him like, ‘Are you saying that’s our option — to save your life, you need to go to jail?’” White Eagle said.\nRapid City Police Department Community Relations Director Brandyn Medina confirmed that if all other options were exhausted, the Pennington County Jail could be used as a temporary shelter.\n“I think they [Olson and Doyle] were speaking on generalities and talking about it on a broad spectrum,” Medina said. “It's not saying that we would find charges to put somebody in the jail or charge them criminally so they could go into the jail, it'd be in a total noncriminal context. It would be simply using the extent of our resources to make sure that nobody was turned away into the cold.”\nA Facebook post from the Rapid City Municipal Government Saturday morning stated that there is an “abundance of space” at established Rapid City shelters.\n“At no point since this cold snap began has the Care Campus or Mission been full or turned individuals away. Anyone seeking shelter during this frigid cold spell are reminded to seek shelter at either facility,” the post read.\nMedina said that law enforcement officers are conducting extra patrols to contact and transport individuals struggling with the cold.\n“The city is fully aware that this is a dangerous time,” Fisher said. “This is a dangerous time for anyone just driving down the street that's not correctly clothed and their vehicle breaks down and they have to walk any distance to shelter. And so it's all eyes on the public to make sure that we're protecting everyone.”\nWithin the Indigenous community, the Lakota Center is working with NDN Collective, Wambli Ska, Dakota AIM Grassroots, Urban Roots Ancient Wisdom, Coup Council and St. Matthews/St. Andrews to provide resources for those in need. The organizations are working to provide food, water, warmth and shelter to those who either cannot go to the Cornerstone Mission and Care Campus or don’t feel comfortable going.\n“A lot of them don't like going on to the campus; a lot of them don't like going to the mission,” White Eagle said. “The mayor is making it very clear that those are our resources, and that's the only thing that they have.”\nAs a backup, the Lakota Homes Oyate Center has been opened for those in need of a warming shelter or a meal. Various Indigenous community groups will be serving meals at the Oyate Center throughout the day. The center is located at 719 Wambli Drive on Rapid City’s northside.\n“If you call anywhere around the Native community right now, there's people cooking, there's people driving, there's young men walking under the bridges,” said NDN Collective Founder and CEO Nick Tilsen. “We're getting out of our vehicles. We're helping the people, we're getting rides, and we're trying to utilize every service that's available. An army tent in the middle of winter is totally last resort.”\nThis story is co-published by the Rapid City Journal and ICT, a news partnership that covers Indigenous communities in the South Dakota area.\nAmelia Schafer is the Indigenous Affairs reporter for ICT and the Rapid City Journal.

    "text": "MTU Cork power past University of Galway in Fitzgibbon Cup\nMTU Cork laid to rest the demons of last year’s 19-point Fitzgibbon Cup quarter-final defeat in Dangan with a powerful and potent performance in Galway tonight, where they were full value for their victory despite the home side’s tally of 15 wides in the hour.\nThe scoring power of MTU’s inside forward line was what leapt off the teamsheet as the main weapon for Pádraig Gould and his selectors and he certainly got a fine tune out of Alan Connolly in particular, who had a very fine night from frees and from open play.\nHowever it was in the back division where they really dominated, and this was made all the more impressive by the fact that Kerry star Evan Murphy was carried off with a little over 10 minutes played.\nMicheál Mullins, Ciarán Joyce and Sam Fitzgerald all had huge games for the underdogs, and they were central to MTU Cork establishing a solid platform in the first half.\nA clever bit of finishing from Liam Collins to beat Cathal Wilson inside the near post gave University of Galway a solid start in top of the ground conditions, but Alan Walsh struck a monster point in response, Joyce was on the mark with some trademark booming strikes from long range, and it fell to Brian Lynch to nudge them in front at 0-7 to 1-3 with 17 minutes played.\nGalway senior hurlers Niall Collins and Gavin Lee carried the fight for the home side through the second quarter but they were taking on water, culminating in Alan Walsh’s low shot to establich a five-point interval lead, 1-11 to 1-6.\nConnolly missed an excellent chance to really squeeze Galway when he fired for goal early in the second half, but his shot was at a good height for Cormac Kenny to make the save. By now MTU were winning most of the ruck balls and getting the better of things in the air, and while there was a brief rally that saw Liam Collins, Colm Molloy and Dan Bourke score in five minutes for UG, the middle ten minutes in the second have saw MTU Cork really open up to go six clear again.\nOnce again, the failure to add a second goal was crucial as three heroic blocks from Mark Hardiman kept UG alive, and a late run of points – including some sumptuous scores from Liam Collins – ensured a tense finish, albeit one that was eventually settled by Seán Walsh rounding off the scoring in stoppage time.\n: N Collins (0-8, 0-7f), L Collins (1-4), G Thomas (0-1), C Molloy (0-1), D Bourke (0-1).\n: A Connolly (0-8, 0-5f, 0-1 65), A Walsh (1-1), C Joyce (0-3, 0-1 65), D Healy (0-2), B Lynch (0-2), M Mullins (0-1), S Walsh (0-1)\n: C Kenny (Cappataggle); K Hanrahan (Loughrea), D Loftus (Turloughmore), M Hardiman (Athenry); T Killeen (Loughrea), G Lee (Clarinbridge), C Cunningham (Moycullen); I McGlynn (Kilconierin), L Leen (Clarinbridge); G Thomas (Castlegar), D Bourke (Ballinamere, Offaly), N Collins (Cappataggle); L Collins (Cappataggle), C Mitchell (Kilcormac-Killoughey, Offaly), C Molloy (Kilnadeema-Leitrim)\n: J Ryan for Cunningham (h-t), M Tarpey for Leen (46), D Comar for Molloy (49), T Leen (Clarinbridge) for McGlynn (59).\n: C Wilson (Newcestown); F O’Connell (St. Catherine’s); E Murphy (Causeway, Kerry), D O’Sullivan (Ballinhassig); S Fitzgerald (Clashmore/Kinsalebeg, Waterford), C Joyce (Castlemartyr), M Mullins (Whitechurch); M Finn (Midleton), R Walsh (Kilmoyley, Kerry); D Healy (Lisgoold), B Lynch (Ballinhassig), S Walsh (Fourmilewater, Waterford); A Walsh (Kanturk), A Connolly (Blackrock), J Cahalane (St. Finbarr’s).\n: E Varian (Glen Rovers) for Murphy (12), R McCarthy (Carrigaline) for O’Connell (43), R O’Sullivan (Newcestown) for Lynch (60+1), M Kelleher (Dicksboro, Kilkenny) for Cahalane (60+2).\nM Farrell (Roscommon).",

    "text": "Former Elle magazine advice columnist E. Jean Carroll watches as former President Donald Trump's video deposition is played in court during a civil trial in which Carroll accuses Trump of raping her in a department store dressing room in the mid-1990s and of defamation, in New York, May 4, 2023, in this courtroom sketch.Jane Rosenberg | Reuters\nA federal appeals court on Thursday denied former President Donald Trump's request to halt proceedings in the upcoming E. Jean Carroll defamation trial.\nIn a court filing last week, Trump's attorneys asked the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to delay the case for 90 days while he considered appealing the court's previous rejection of his efforts to use presidential immunity as a defense.\nThe appeals court denied that request on Thursday, allowing the trial to begin Jan. 16.\nTrump's request for a pause in the proceedings came after the appeals court unanimously ruled that the former president had waited too long — three years — to raise his presidential immunity defense in the defamation trial.\nTrump had argued that he couldn't be sued for remarks he made in 2019 about Carroll and the claims of sexual assault against him because he was president at the time. He also contended that his comments were related to his official duties as president because he needed to speak publicly about the accusations being false.\nRead more on NBC News\nFederal judge accepts redrawn Georgia congressional and legislative districts that will favor GOP Jan. 6 rioter cooperated with prosecutors in murder case, court records show Trump on trial: What to expect in 2024 from the former president's legal cases The court noted that while Carroll filed her defamation suit in November 2019, followed by Trump's response in January 2020, he didn't bring up the presidential immunity defense until January 2023. Allowing him to use that defense now would cause “undue prejudice” to Carroll, the judges said in their ruling.\nThe upcoming trial is the second one involving Trump and Carroll, a magazine writer who alleged Trump raped her in the mid-1990s and defamed her after she spoke out publicly with her accusations in 2019. Trump has repeatedly denied the allegations. A jury this year found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation and awarded Carroll $5 million in damages, a verdict Trump is appealing.\nThe second trial centers on remarks Trump made about Carroll during his presidency and after the $5 million verdict, including his disparaging comments against her such as calling her a “whack job.” The trial, which is expected to last three to five days, only focuses on what money damages Carroll is entitled to.\nU.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in June denied Trump's immunity argument, writing that presidential immunity is “not a 'get out of damages liability free' card.”\nTrump has also raised the presidential immunity argument in the election interference case brought against him by special counsel Jack Smith. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan shot down his argument in that case, ruling this month that the former president was not immune to the criminal charges. Trump, who has pleaded not guilty in the case, appealed the ruling to the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. The Supreme Court last week denied Smith's request for the high court to immediately decide the matter.",

Ciencia » Salud Psicología Tecnología Actualidad social El 93% de personas de comunidad musulmana dice haber sufrido discriminación, según informe Asociación Marroquí Agencias @DiarioSigloXXI viernes, 29 de diciembre de 2023, 12:45 h (CET) MÁLAGA, 29 (EUROPA PRESS) La Asociación Marroquí para la Integración de los Inmigrantes ha llevado a cabo la investigación '¿Por qué no se denuncia la islamofobia en España?', elaborada a nivel nacional, de la que se extrae, entre otras conclusiones, que el 93% de las personas que pertenecen a la comunidad musulmana afirman haber sido víctimas de actitudes discriminatorias por motivos islamófobos, racistas y/o xenófobos. Esto supone, según han puesto de manifiesto desde la Asociación Marroquí a través de un comunicado, que \"solo siete de cada 100 personas pertenecientes a dicho colectivo sienten que no han sufrido discriminación por dichos motivos en España\". Se trata, han señalado, de un estudio \"pionero\" a nivel nacional cuyo objetivo es contabilizar, tanto cuantitativamente como cualitativamente, la situación de la discriminación por motivos islamófobos en el país. En este estudio han participado 650 personas musulmanas o percibidas como tal de todas las comunidades y ciudades autónomas de España, 38 administraciones públicas y entidades sociales y 19 grupos focales, donde participaron personas que ya se percibían como víctimas de discursos de odio motivado por este asunto. La investigación se ha elaborado en el marco del Programa Estatal de lucha contra la Infradenuncia en la discriminación islamófoba, financiado por el Ministerio de Derechos Sociales, Consumo y Agenda 2030 con cargo a la asignación tributaria del Impuesto sobre la Renta de las Personas Físicas y del Impuesto sobre Sociedades. Según han afirmado desde la asociación, las conclusiones arrojan \"la necesidad de seguir facilitando herramientas para contestar a la islamofobia, ya que el alto porcentaje de personas que sufren discriminación se complementa con que sólo un 6,4% de las víctimas denuncia\". \"Es decir, el 93,6% de los casos de odio no se ponen en conocimiento de las autoridades competentes\", han incidido. En cuanto a las causas de la infradenuncia, en el informe se apunta que los motivos más comunes son \"que no sabían que podían denunciarlo, la falta de confianza en las instituciones y el temor a ser discriminado/a o no ser atendidos/as adecuadamente debido a su cultura y/o religión\". Por otro lado, en cuanto a la forma en la que se manifiestan estas agresiones, la investigación destaca que ocho de cada diez víctimas de islamofobia \"sufren comentarios, insultos y gestos ofensivos y/o alguna forma de ofensa e intolerancia por uso del hiyab, siendo estas una de las formas de discriminación de las más predominantes\". Asimismo, una de cada cuatro agresiones que sufre una mujer musulmana en España se produce como consecuencia del uso del hiyab, han indicado desde la Asociación Marroquí. Los lugares o contextos en donde más discriminación islamófoba se manifiesta son la calle o lugar público, el sitio de trabajo y el colegio o centro educativo. A través de esta investigación, han asegurado que también se ha podido cuantificar \"la necesidad de aumentar los recursos que protejan a las víctimas, ya que la discriminación por islamofobia no es un hecho aislado\". Al respecto, han apuntado que las víctimas \"suelen ser reiteradamente agredidas\". De hecho, han indicado que \"nueve de cada diez personas que fueron encuestadas declararon haber sufrido algún tipo de discriminación y/o conducta de odio en más de una ocasión\". Asimismo, una de cada cuatro víctimas necesitó apoyo psicológico y emocional, recibiéndola solamente un 26% de las mismas, señala el estudio. El resto declaró en su mayoría no haberla recibido por falta de medios. Desde la Asociación Marroquí han concluido que \"se confirma que la discriminación por islamofobia, al igual que otras formas de odio, suele ser sutil y estar normalizada\". \"Esto explica el alto porcentaje de personas afectadas y el elevado índice de infradenuncia\", han manifestado. Por esto han insistido en la importancia de \"seguir visibilizando estos datos, de aumentar la sensibilización ciudadana y de trabajar desde la transversalidad para disminuir esta lacra\". Asimismo, han reiterado que \"es muy importante dar a conocer repetidamente que detrás de estas agresiones y comentarios se encuentran personas a las que se les está atacando su integridad moral y en ocasiones física\". \"Desde la entidad, consideramos que sigue existiendo un vacío estadístico en este campo, por lo que es necesario seguir trabajando la islamofobia también desde el campo de la investigación y el mundo académico\", han señalado en el comunicado, recordando que como asociación que lleva cinco años elaborando el Programa Nacional para la Prevención de la Islamofobia han recogido algunas recomendaciones \"para frenar el odio, que son útiles tanto para administraciones como para la sociedad en general\".
