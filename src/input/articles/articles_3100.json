Questo fenomeno meteorologico, di origine sub-tropicale, porterà temperature elevate e condizioni climatiche anomale. L'anticiclone Caronte, proveniente dal deserto del Sahara, porterà un aumento significativo delle temperature in tutta Italia. Le masse d'aria calda, unite al sole intenso, faranno salire i valori termici a livelli estremi. Secondo le previsioni, questa nuova fase di caldo intenso durerà per diversi giorni, con picchi di temperatura che potrebbero superare i 40 gradi in alcune regioni. L'ondata di caldo di luglio 2024 ha evidenziato gli effetti tangibili del cambiamento climatico indotto dall'uomo. Secondo uno studio del World Weather Attribution, le temperature raggiunte sarebbero state praticamente impossibili senza il riscaldamento globale causato dalla combustione di combustibili fossili. Questo fenomeno mette in luce la necessità di adottare misure urgenti per contrastare il cambiamento climatico e ridurre le emissioni di gas serra. A Firenze, l'allerta da bollino rosso è stata estesa fino a domani, venerdì 2 agosto. Questo significa che la città ha registrato temperature superiori ai 35 gradi per 18 giorni consecutivi. Il bollettino elaborato dal dipartimento di epidemiologia SSR Regione Lazio, nell'ambito del sistema operativo nazionale di previsione e prevenzione degli effetti del caldo, ha evidenziato l'importanza di adottare comportamenti e misure di prevenzione per ridurre le conseguenze nocive delle ondate di calore. Per affrontare al meglio questa nuova ondata di caldo, è fondamentale seguire alcune semplici misure di prevenzione. Bere molta acqua, evitare l'esposizione diretta al sole nelle ore più calde della giornata e indossare abiti leggeri e traspiranti sono solo alcune delle raccomandazioni per proteggersi dalle alte temperature. Inoltre, è importante prestare particolare attenzione alle persone più vulnerabili, come anziani e bambini, che sono maggiormente a rischio di colpi di calore e disidratazione.",

Amber Campbell from [Co Armagh](https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/all-about/co-armagh) has been singing as long as she has been talking and is ready to take the next step by releasing her first single. Her mother Mary said there is no stopping the schoolgirl who continues to make the proud at every performance.

One of Amber's covers has received over 633k views on Facebook with Mary saying the family were \"absolutely blown away by the response\". She continued: \"An email came through from the Northern Ireland Country Awards saying they had seen her video and asked if would she like to perform - she was absolutely blown away as it is such an honour for a 9-year-old and will be the youngest ever to perform at this event. \"She is so excited about it as she will meet some of the biggest names in country music.\" Amber is going to Donegal this month where she will be releasing her first single. \"Amber is a quiet girl who is quite grounded takes everything in her stride and enjoys all the simple things,\" her mother added. \"2024 is going to be an exciting year with her new release and the country awards - she also has a few big bookings and charity events, she’s a busy girl but very excited to see where it all takes her. \"As a parent it’s amazing to see your child on stage to get standing ovations and watch her grow with confidence, it’s truly amazing and we are all very proud of her.\" Join our Belfast Live breaking news service on WhatsApp [Click this link](https://chat.whatsapp.com/LU5TE4vC7DOJ3M6yruB11W) or scan the QR code to receive breaking news and top stories from Belfast Live.
