    "text": "Bogotá, 14 mar (EFE).- El excandidato presidencial colombiano Rodolfo Hernández fue condenado este jueves por el delito de interés indebido en celebración de contratos por un caso de adjudicación de contratos cuando era alcalde de Bucaramanga (noreste) y reveló durante la audiencia en la que fue hallado culpable que padece un cáncer terminal.\n\"El señor Rodolfo Hernández Suárez será condenado en este caso, de acuerdo a la postulación que fue presentada por el Ministerio Público en su condición de autor. Es decir, va a haber una variación jurídica sobre la participación en el delito de interés indebido en la celebración de contratos\", expresó el juez Décimo Penal del Circuito con funciones de Conocimiento, a la espera de conocer en qué consistirá la condena.\nEl caso por el que condenaron a Hernández es por corrupción en la adjudicación de un contrato para implementar nuevas tecnologías para tratar los residuos sólidos cuando fue alcalde de la ciudad de Bucaramanga entre 2016 y 2019.\nEsto porque tenía un interés indebido en la asignación del contrato para el aprovechamiento y disposición final de residuos sólidos a la unión temporal Vitalogic RSU.\nEl objetivo era que con este contrato su hijo obtuviera beneficios económicos, por lo que Hernández se contactó con los representantes de la empresa que iba a implementar la nueva tecnología en Bucaramanga y les entregó información privilegiada para que tuvieran ventajas en la licitación.\nHernández, un magnate e ingeniero civil, irrumpió en la política nacional al presentarse como candidato a la Presidencia de Colombia en las elecciones de 2022 por el movimiento Liga de Gobernantes Anticorrupción con propuestas de corte populista.\nEso le valió pasar a segunda vuelta en la que perdió con Petro, actual presidente de Colombia y cuyo mandato finalizará el 7 de agosto de 2026.\nGracias a ese resultado Hernández ganó un escaño en el Senado pero renunció dos meses después para enfocarse en el trabajo \"por el país\" desde su partido.

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

(WFTX) - A dog missing for two years after she walked away from her Maryland home was overjoyed at being reunited with her owner.\nTony Duncan says he lives in a wooded area in Mardela Springs, Maryland, and would let his dog, Luna, walk the property freely. About two years ago, Luna chased after some wildlife and vanished into the woods. Her owner looked for her but couldn’t find her.\n“Been sitting, waiting and hoping for two years now that she would return… and today’s the day,” Duncan said.\nAs it turned out, Luna somehow traveled more than 1,000 miles from her home in Maryland to LaBelle, Florida.\nDuncan got an unexpected call Wednesday from LaBelle Animal Control, who found his missing dog walking in a Walmart parking lot and scanned her microchip.\nLuna’s owner says he and his friend cleared their schedules without hesitation, rented a car and made the 16-hour drive to LaBelle, so he could reunite with his dog.\n“Well, apparently, she’s been living in Florida for two years, so she definitely knows where to vacation,” Duncan said.\nDuncan suspects someone may have stolen Luna and brought her to Florida, only to abandon her later. The exact details of the dog’s journey remain a mystery known only to her.\nLaBelle Animal Control is emphasizing the importance of microchipping pets. They say this reunion would not have been possible without Luna’s chip.\nCopyright 2024 WFTX via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Have you been part of a rescue story? Any first responder will tell you that there is nothing quite like saving someone’s life. Today, we’re going to look at some of the most incredible rescue stories ever. They took place on battlefields,\noceans, and even underground! Hopefully, you will be encouraged by the virtue and solidarity that is reflected in these rescues. Check out these 25 Incredible Rescue Stories That Will Blow Your Mind!\nApollo 13\nIn 1970, during NASA’s seventh manned mission to the moon, an oxygen tank exploded on Apollo 13 while it was mid-flight. With the help of engineers on the ground, the astronauts jury-rigged the CO2 removal system and safely made it back to Earth.\nTommy the Cat\nWhen officer Patrick Daughtery entered Gary Rosheisen’s home in 2005, he found Gary laying on the ground next to his wheelchair. His cat, Tommy, was lying near the phone. When the 911 call came in to dispatch, a police officer was sent to the scene because there was silence on the line. Rosheisen later explained how he had once tried to teach Tommy to dial 911 but wasn’t sure if it had worked…until that day!\nThe Heimlich Hound\nWhen Debbie Parkhurst choked on an apple in her home, she tried to do the Heimlich maneuver on herself. Unsuccessful, her dog Toby then reared up, pushed her to the ground, and jumped on her chest until the apple came loose!\nFire Dog\nWhen Candace Jennings of Idaho rescued Anna from an animal shelter, she had no idea that Anna would rescue her right back. One morning in 2007, Anna woke Candace with her howls because the trailer was on fire. They both escaped, but when Candace tried to come back for something, she got disoriented in the smoke. Anna had apparently followed her back into the building and led Candace out again!\nJesus Garcia and Nacozari\nOn November 7, 1907, Jesus Garcia was on duty as a railroad engineer in the town of Nacozari, Mexico, when he noticed that a train car containing dynamite had caught on fire. He drove the car out of town where it exploded, killing him and 12 other rail workers. The town is eternally grateful.\nUruguay's Old Christian Club Rugby Team\nOn Oct. 13, 1972, 45 passengers, which included members, friends, and family of Uruguay’s Old Christian Club rugby team, crashed in the Andes on their way from Montevideo to Santiago. While several passengers died either on impact or in an avalanche, 16 of the original 45 were eventually rescued via helicopter.\nKankuntu\n2 years into their around-the-world sailing trip, British couple Peter and Betty Lee were boating off the coast of Venezuela when they were attacked by pirates. Although they were tied up, their hunting dog, Kankuntu, came to their rescue. He attacked the pirates and scared them off. Unfortunately, Kankuntu was shot and stabbed in the process, but the couple were able to dress his wounds.\nMoko and the Whales\nIn 2008, a sperm whale and her calf got caught on a sandbar off the coast of New Zealand. When human efforts failed, a dolphin named Moko showed up and managed to lead the whales to safety!\nThe Arapahoe Basin\nWhen a man got his backpack caught in a chair lift while trying to get off, it left him dangling from the lift high above the mountain. One of the ski instructors (who fortunately also happened to be a professional slackliner) managed to save the poor skier by climbing up along the wire and cutting him loose!\nJessica McClure\nAs an 18 month old baby, Jessica fell 22 feet down a narrow, abandoned well. While CNN filmed live, people around the world watched as rescuers dug a parallel hole to get her out.\nDaniel Mazur and Lincoln Hall\nAfter succumbing to altitude sickness 2 hours from the summit of Mount Everest, Lincoln Hall was assumed to be dead by his comrades. Little did they know that another climber named Daniel Mazur had stumbled across a disoriented Lincoln and carried him back down the mountain (thus abandoning the Everest summit).\nNote: not all climbers are so fortunate. Many times people coming down the mountain don’t have enough energy to carry fatigued comrades, and those going up don’t want to sacrifice their Everest glory. Thus, you can quite literally die just feet from dozens of people.\nVickie Williams-Tillman\nVickie Williams-Tillman was driving to the store in Baton Rouge, Louisiana when she saw police officer Billy Aime wrestling with a suspect. The suspect had grabbed Billy’s baton and repeatedly bashed his head with it. Vickie fearlessly jumped on the suspect’s back and helped subdue him.\nHudson River Rescue\nOn Jan. 15, 2009, flight 1548 took off from New York, lost power, and landed in the Hudson River. The pilot, Chesley B. Sullenberger, was hailed as a hero when not a single life was lost. Fire boats, Coast Guard, and police boats managed to pick up all the passengers from the water.\nCentral Park\nIn February 2017, Bennett Jonas and Ethan Turnbull were skating in Central Park when they saw several kids dancing on the ice. The ice gave way and the kids plunged into the water. Jonas and Turmbull managed to pull all seven of them to safety.\nIngrid Betancourt\nWhile campaigning for the Colombian presidency in FARC territory in 2002, Ingrid was kidnapped by rebels. For 6 years nobody knew where she was. Eventually, undercover government forces infiltrated FARC and managed to rescue Ingrid. Her rescue was celebrated throughout the country.\nSS Andrea Doria\nOn July 25, 1956, Italian luxury liner SS Andrea Doria collided with the MS Stockholm off the coast of Massachusetts. In the 11 hours that it took the SS Andrea to sink, over a thousand passengers escaped onto the MS Stockholm and other surrounding ships. Only 46 peopled died. It is one of the greatest seaborne rescues of modern day.\nThe Chilean Miners\nOn Aug. 5, 2010, a mine collapsed in northern Chile. 33 miners had to spend the next several months underground until rescuers could reach them. On Oct. 13, 2010 the world looked on as the miners were brought to the surface and reunited with their families.\nUSS Squalus\nOn May 23, 1939, a valve failure caused the submarine USS Squalus to sink. It wasn’t until over 24 hours later that searchers finally managed to reached the sub and extract the entire crew alive!\n100 puppies\nIn January 2017, a truck carrying over one hundred puppies crashed into a ditch off of New York State’s Interstate 86. Volunteers and rescuers acted quickly to triage and treat the puppies, all of whom eventually turned out fine.\nMV Maersk Alabama\nOn April 8, 2009, off the coast of Somalia, the MV Maersk Alabama became the first American vessel to be hijacked by pirates in almost 200 years. The pirates fled with Captain Richard Phillips, but not for long. Navy SEAL snipers took out the pirates and rescued the Captain.\nManfred Kick\nWhile Kick was driving his Tesla down the German Autobahn near Munich, he noticed a fellow driver was swerving erratically. He pulled up to the car and saw that the driver was limp and unconscious. Acting quickly, he drove in front of the other driver’s vehicle and slowed it down using his own. The damage to Kick’s Tesla was significant, but he had saved a life that day. And oh yea, Elon Musk offered to have his Tesla fixed free of charge!\nHurricane Katrina\nAnytime there’s a natural disaster, there are many people in need of rescue. And while there are many individual stories, it’s worth noting that in one of the most devastating natural disasters in US history, rescuers managed to swim and airlift over 30,000 people to safety! It’s quite impressive.\nDaniel Aufdenblatten and Richard Lehner\nOn April 29, 2010, a storm trapped 3 Spanish climbers on Annapurna in Nepal. As they froze on the world’s 10th highest mountain, Swiss pilots Daniel Aufdenblatten and Richard Lehner took their helicopter to nearly 7,000 meters (22,966 feet) to save them! They received the “Heroism Award,” which is one of the highest honors in aviation.\nBataan Death March\nThe Bataan Death March was when the Japanese forced allied prisoners of war to march through the hot Philippine jungles. In January, 1945, 121 Army Rangers rescued over 500 captives. Hampton Sides’ 2002 bestseller Ghost Soldiers: The Epic Account of World War II’s Greatest Rescue Mission recounts the tales of heroism.\nHaiti Earthquake\nOn Jan. 12, 2010, Darlene Etienne was studying at her cousin’s place in Port-au-Prince when the 7.0 earthquake struck. For fifteen days she was trapped in the rubble until a passerby heard her screams. Her rescue was broadcast live on television.\nLists Going Viral Right Now\nFeatured Image: pixabay (public domain)\n25-17. pixabay (public domain), 16. wikimedia commons (public domain), 15. pixabay (public domain), 14.\nfacebook.com (fair use; no free images available; illustrative purposes only), 13-9. pixabay (public domain), 8. wikimedia commons (public domain), 7. pixabay (public domain), 6. wikimedia commons (public domain), 5-1. pixabay (public domain)",

    "title": "Stardust victims ‘written into the history books’, State ceremony hears",
    "text": "Those who died in the Stardust fire tragedy have been written into the history books, Taoiseach Simon Harris said, as a State ceremony honoured the victims and survivors. Hundreds of people attended the ceremony of commemoration, which was led by President Michael D Higgins, at the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin city centre. The hour-long ceremony remembered and honoured the 48 young people who died in the 1981 disaster. Co-designed with the families of the victims, the ceremony also remembered all those who helped victims and their families on the night and over the years since. The ceremony opened with music from North Dublin Gospel Community Choir, who sang a rendition of Pink’s What About Us and Coldplay’s Fix You. Mr Higgins laid a wreath on behalf of the people of Ireland. In a statement, he said: “I was pleased to have the honour of laying a wreath on behalf of the people of Ireland at today’s ceremony of commemoration in the Garden of Remembrance on what was a very important day for the relatives of the victims, for the survivors and for all those affected by the Stardust fire. “I look forward to welcoming the families who lost loved ones and those who were injured in the fire to Aras an Uachtarain in the autumn.” Family members also laid a wreath for each of the 48 victims on the water in the cruciform pool while the names of the victims, and extracts from their pen portraits were read out. Speaking at the ceremony, Mr Harris said: “It is fitting that in this special place in our capital city, a place for reflection and recollection, that we gathered to commemorate those 48 young people who went out to enjoy themselves on Valentine’s eve in 1981 and never came home. “Today, we take the next step with this State commemoration. Here, in this garden, we often come to remember fallen heroes. “I know that’s what those 48 young people were to their families and to their communities. “You, the families of those who died, those who survived, those who were injured and those who fought to save lives on that night and afterwards, became their heroes. “So many people here today, and many who sadly did not live to see today, never gave up fighting for the memory of their loved ones. “Today, finally, at last your fight sees them properly commemorated by the State, in recognition of their terrible loss in a national tragedy. “You have ensured that your loved ones and the Stardust tragedy will be remembered by the generations to come. “You have ensured their names are written in the history books, just as their 48 young faces are etched on our national collective memory.” Roddy Doyle read a piece he composed especially for the ceremony entitled Names, while violinist Zoe Conway performed Be Thou My Vision. The majority of those attending were the families of those who died, survivors and first responders who worked on the night of the fire. Uilleann piper Kevin Rowsome performed The Parting Glass, Mary Byrne performed This Is The Moment, while the Dublin Fire Brigade, which was central to rescuing people from the fire, performed Amazing Grace. Christy Moore sang They Never Came Home, which was followed by Eddie Sherlock performing You Will Never Walk Alone. Fr Joe Jones said: “We are here today struggling for words to express our feelings, and lost for words. “We remember those whose lives were cut short, the 48 young people who never came home. “Their names are written forever in our hearts, never to be forgotten. “Bless those who mourn the lives of these young people, give them healing and the comfort of your love, that they may face each day with hope and certain that nothing can take from the richness of the gift of each life remembered today. “We remember also those who have died and whose lives were imprinted with grief and pain, as they fought hard for justice over the years. “Their efforts were not in vain.” After more than 40 years of the victims’ families campaigning for justice, an inquest in April found the 48 young people had been unlawfully killed. Days later, Mr Harris made a State apology in the Dáil. Antoinette Keegan, whose sisters Mary and Martina died in the fire, described it as a “very momentous day”. “It was really special. Forty-three years later and every effort went into it and all the people that participated, absolutely fantastic,” the campaigner said. “It was emotional but at the same time it was like a joyful day. And for the 48 victims being remembered, never been forgotten. “I also remember my two parents who were major campaigners in this, John and Christine Keegan, they weren’t forgotten about either because they were brought in to today, and (long-term campaigner) Eugene Kelly and (journalist) Charlie Bird. “It has been a big day and the 48 victims should always be remembered and never forgotten.” The ceremony was brought to an end by the Artane Band playing the national anthem.",
