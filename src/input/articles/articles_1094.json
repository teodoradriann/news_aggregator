    "title": "Why the northern lights have been lighting up southwestern Ontario skies, and how you can see them tonight | CBC News",
    "text": "Sightings of the northern lights — known as the aurora borealis — have become an increasingly common topic of discussion for people in southwestern Ontario this year, with social media feeds periodically becoming flooded with photos of mesmerizing green and pink hues in the night sky.\nAccording to a local astronomer and a professor at Western University in London, the increase in auroral activity is thanks to the sun's natural cycle, which culminates in a period of increased activity about every 11 years.\n\"The sun's activity has definitely increased in the past year. It's actually higher than it's been in more than 20 years,\" said Jan Cami, also the director of the university's Hume Cronyn Observatory.\nThe aurora borealis is caused by solar particles that are flung from the sun toward the Earth by an explosion of energy on the sun's surface called a coronal mass ejection (CME).\n\"[That energy] travels a few hundred kilometres a second until it reaches Earth,\" said Cami. \"There's a whole mess of charged particles that impact the Earth's magnetic field.\"\nA photo of the aurora borealis near London, Ont. (Submitted by Devarsh Patel) The distinct colours in the aurora are caused by those particles interacting with elements in the atmosphere.\nWhen the sun's 11-year cycle comes to a close, it reaches what's called solar maximum — a state in which events like solar flares and CMEs are significantly more common due to changes in the sun's magnetic field. Activity increases as the solar cycle progresses, moving closer to solar maximum, and then slows down on its way to the other end of the cycle known as solar minimum.\n\"We're approaching the maximum,\" said Cami. \"We may have already reached the maximum, but we won't know until eight or so months after it happens because of the way these things are measured.\"\nAccording to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA), a severe geomagnetic storm was underway as of 1 p.m. on Thursday and the likelihood of northern lights being visible in southwestern Ontario is high.\nNOAA updates its aurora forecast dashboard periodically to show aurora activity predictions. (NOAA) \"Millions of people enjoyed the solar eclipse without necessarily knowing all the science behind it. I think it's the same for northern lights, whether or not you understand what's happening. I go out not as a scientist, but as a human being who likes to experience this,\" Cami said.\nCraig Levine is a former national president of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada and a longtime member of the London Centre of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. He's also an amateur astrophotographer who hopes to capture some of the ethereal tapestry in the sky.\n\"It's better than any fireworks display you'll ever see,\" said Levine, adding the wonder light show builds over time.\n\"You tend to look toward the north, first, and you'll see a greenish hazy glow on the horizon. Then, the colours intensify, and you'll see greens, reds, and some oranges. For bigger storms like this, you can sometimes see big, shimmering sheets as the aurora moves overhead and all around.\"\nAmateur astronomer Craig Levine took this photo on Oct. 7, 2024, just north of Strathroy, Ont. (Craig Levine) For those hoping to see the aurora on Thursday or Friday night, both Levine and Cami have similar advice — find somewhere that's far from the city lights, and dress for cooler temperatures. Levine said it's important to be patient, and Cami advised that forecasts can sometimes be inaccurate.\nAccording to NOAA, the best time of day to see the lights is often between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.\nLevine said perhaps the best way to enjoy the lights is to share the experience with others.\n\"There's so much division right now, but we all share the night sky, and that's a wonderful thing to bring people together.\"",

    "text": "White House believes US aid will help Ukraine launch counteroffensive in 2025 – FT Ukraine will seek to launch a new counteroffensive in 2025 after receiving over US$60 billion in US security assistance. Source: [ Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/6fd11006-01db-4548-96d6-76343f38aea8), citing Jake Sullivan, US National Security Advisor Details: The FT noted that Sullivan said he still expects \"Russian advances in the coming period\" on the battlefield despite the new US aid package approved last month as \"you can’t instantly flip the switch\". However, the official added that with the new aid from Washington, Kyiv will be able to \"hold the line\" and \"ensure Ukraine withstands the Russian assault\" through 2024. Referring to next year's war scenario, Sullivan added that Ukraine plans \"to move forward to recapture the territory that the Russians have taken from them\". \"His comments about a potential counteroffensive by Ukraine represent the White House’s clearest articulation of how it views the conflict evolving if president Joe Biden wins re-election in November,\" the FT stressed. Furthermore, the Financial Times reported that the possibility of a new Ukrainian offensive in 2025 hinges on increased and approved funding from the US Congress and the White House. Background: - Sullivan [acknowledged](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/04/24/7452824/)that Ukrainian forces have lost some territory in the country's east, including the war-torn town of Avdiivka, due to delays in approving aid to Ukraine. - On 24 April, US President Joe Biden [signed legislation](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/04/24/7452795/)enacted by Congress that provides for about US$61 billion of additional military and economic aid to Ukraine, as well as help for other US allies. - Immediately afterwards, the US announced a [US$1 billion military aid package](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/04/24/7452800/)for Ukraine.

    "text": "A driving school is using the approach of “catch them young, watch them grow” to attract fresh talent into the trucking industry.\nCommercial Heavy Equipment Training (CHET), Musket Transport’s in-house driving school gave young immigrants an immersive trucking experience during a workshop at their Burlington, Ont. campus.\nSophia Sniegowski Begidzhanov, corporate communications officer, Musket Transport/CHET, said that obtaining an A/Z licence provides a gateway into the industry. There are a lot of opportunities in transportation, and driving experience is invaluable if one seeks to pursue opportunities in operations or management in the future, she added.\nYouth workshop attendees get a truck tour at CHET’s Burlington, Ont. campus. (Photo: Leo Barros) CHET teamed up with an immigrant services organization and Toronto Business Development Centre (TBDC) for the event.\nThe learning process does not end after getting a licence and finding a job, Anthony Dyal, Musket’s fleet resources manager, told the youngsters.\n“You have to constantly work at your trade. If you do that, you will be successful, because this is an industry where you can grow,” he said.\nCareer path Musket’s driver manager Mensur Xhemajli revealed how his career path began at CHET, training for his commercial driving licence. He went on to drive truck on and off for 15 years, including a stint as an owner-operator. His other jobs included being a crane operator, driving instructor and yard supervisor.\nXhemajli urged the young people to maintain clean driving records, especially if they were interested in making trucking a career. Speeding, reckless driving and crashes are frowned upon, he added.\nAnthony Dyal gives an overview of the trucking industry to attendees. (Photo: Leo Barros) Hammad Hassan, program manager, explore trucking careers, TBDC said that starting out in trucking can lead to other careers. He said that he obtained his A/Z licence after immigrating to Canada.\n“Trucking brought me here; I’m now working as a program manager. It can take you anywhere, use that knowledge to advance yourself. The opportunities are endless,” he said.\nSandra Graham, CHET’s operations manager, noted that getting a D/Z licence is an easier pathway into trucking. The training duration is shorter, and fees are lower.\nGiven the current economic and freight situation, there are more opportunities for D/Z driving jobs, Hassan told the attendees.\nTraining and professionalism Graham highlighted the importance of proper training and road safety. “In trucking, you are only as good as your last mistake. They are expensive or could hurt somebody,” she said.\nProfessionalism also matters, since truck driving is a customer-facing job, attendees were told. The speakers noted that drivers sometimes get pulled over by enforcement officers and their conduct can make a difference as to how that interaction unfolds.\nFrancois Jeddi, CHET’s sales manager, explained the difference between local and longhaul driving work and the types of jobs available, including hauling vans and reefers, and getting more specialized with flatbed and tanker operations.\nWhen an attendee asked him about the hours of work, he explained the number of hours a driver could legally drive. But truckers can expect to work weekends and nights, he said, adding that transportation continues 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n(Photo: Leo Barros) Representatives from a financial literacy organization and a loan provider also spoke to attendees about funding options to propel their career paths.\nAfter lunch, the youngsters took a spin on the truck-driving simulator and got an opportunity to ride in a tractor-trailer.\nOmar, who is exploring trucking as a career, said that the workshop helped answer his questions and shed more light on the industry. Alighting from the truck after a ride with other participants, he said that he enjoyed the experience.\nWill he be behind the wheel of a big rig some time soon? He said that it was highly likely in the near future.\nRecruitment strategies have to change to attract youth to trucking: panel",

    "text": "Papa pede aos intervenientes nas guerras que escutem \"a voz da consciência\" O Papa Francisco pediu hoje aos que têm \"interesses\" nas guerras que \"escutem a voz da consciência\" no final do ano e tenham \"a coragem\" de se questionar sobre quantas vidas se perderam nesses conflitos. \"No final do ano, tenhamos a coragem de nos perguntar quantas vidas foram ceifadas pelos conflitos armados, quantos mortos, quanta destruição e sofrimento ou quanta pobreza\", apelou o pontífice depois de rezar a oração do Angelus na janela do Palácio Apostólico, acrescentando: \"Quem tem interesse nestes conflitos deve ouvir a voz da consciência\". O Papa já tinha lamentado a onda de violência que abalou a Nigéria neste Natal e pediu a Deus que livrasse o país \"destes horrores\" e recordou \"os martirizados\" povos da Ucrânia, de Israel, da Palestina e do Sudão, pedindo também para não se esquecer os Rohingya, o grupo étnico muçulmano de Myanmar sujeito a perseguição e assédio. Durante a mensagem do Angelus, o Papa Francisco questionou igualmente os pais se na sua vida quotidiana \"encontram tempo\" para brincar com os filhos. \"Pergunto-vos, pais e mães, se encontram tempo para brincar com os vossos filhos ou para os levar a passear. Ontem falei com uma pessoa ao telefone e perguntei-lhe onde estava. Ela respondeu-me que estava na rua com os filhos. É uma bela paternidade e maternidade\", declarou. Francisco refletiu sobre esta questão antes da oração do último Angelus e no último dia do ano, em que a Igreja Católica celebra a Sagrada Família, e recomendou que se guarde \"a capacidade de se maravilhar\" para que as relações familiares possam ser positivas. \"A capacidade de se maravilhar pode ser um segredo para se dar bem na família, não se habituar à normalidade das coisas\", aconselhou da janela do Palácio Apostólico aos cerca de 20 mil fiéis que o escutavam da Praça de São Pedro, segundo dados da Gendarmaria do Vaticano. Francisco disse que \"é bom que os casais saibam surpreender-se com o seu próprio cônjuge, por exemplo, pegando-lhe na mão ou olhando-o nos olhos por um momento, à noite, com ternura\".

    "text": "Gelsenkirchen. Stadt Gelsenkirchen und Westfälische Hochschule in Buer freuen sich über eine besondere Auszeichnung für ihr gemeinsames KI-Projekt.\nGroße Ehre für „Urban KI“: Das Projekt, das im Auftrag der Stadt Gelsenkirchen derzeit an der Westfälischen Hochschule (WH) in Buer umgesetzt wird, hat eine besondere Auszeichnung erhalten. Die Vereinigung „Die Deutsche Wirtschaft“ (DDW) kürte die KI-Initiative für Städte und Gemeinden zum „Innovator des Jahres 2025“. Das Projekt erhält diese Anerkennung „für die bundesweite und praxisnahe Entwicklung von KI-Anwendungen zur Lösung kommunaler Herausforderungen“, hieß es in der Begründung der DDW.\nPerspektivisch sollen alle 11.000 deutschen Kommunen von den Ergebnissen profitieren\nSeit dem Start im April 2024 arbeiten die Macherinnen und Macher von „Urban KI“ an möglichen Einsatzgebieten von Künstlicher Intelligenz (KI) in den rund 11.000 deutschen Kommunen. Herauskommen sollen bei den Forschungen aber keine bloßen Absichtserklärungen oder Visionen, sondern konkrete technische Lösungen, die von den Kommunen auch möglichst sofort umgesetzt und angewandt werden können.\nDas Projekt wird mit rund 4,5 Millionen Euro an Finanzmitteln gefördert. Den Großteil steuert das Bundesbauministerium bei, einen kleineren Teil übernimmt die Stadt Gelsenkirchen. Nach einem bundesweiten Aufruf waren im Vorjahr rund 60 konkrete Projektideen aus deutschen Kommunen eingereicht. Ein Beirat aus Fachleuten legte dann jene neun Anwendungsfälle fest, zu denen nun an der WH geforscht wird und für die Lösungen erarbeitet werden sollen.\nProjekte suchen auch Lösungen im Bereich Energieeffizienz\nZu den zentralen Innovationsfeldern, für die nun konkrete Lösungen gesucht werden, gehören die Stadt- und Mobilitätsplanung, die Digitalisierung von Verwaltungsprozessen, der Klimaschutz, die Energieeffizienz und der Bevölkerungsschutz. Ziel des Ganzen sei es, Prozesse in der Stadtentwicklung mittels KI zu optimieren. „Urban KI“ übernimmt dabei die technische Umsetzung, während die Kommunen ihre fachliche Expertise einbringen.\n„Wir freuen uns sehr. Die Auszeichnung ist ein großer Ansporn und hilft uns, das Projekt noch sichtbarer zu machen. Denn wir erforschen und entwickeln konkrete KI-Lösungen, die dann allen Kommunen in Deutschland zugutekommen werden“, erklärte Prof. Dr. Julia Frohne von der WH. Sie ist Mitglied im Leitungsgremium von „Urban KI“. Ihr Gremiums-Kollege Prof. Dr. Christian Kuhlmann ergänzte: „Mit der Würdigung als Innovator des Jahres sehen wir uns bestärkt, die Entwicklung nachhaltiger und praxistauglicher KI-Lösungen weiter voranzutreiben und bundesweit verfügbar zu machen.“\nPreisverleihung erfolgt im November in Berlin\nAuch Manfred vom Sondern meldete sich als Projektbeauftragter der Stadt Gelsenkirchen zu Wort: „Die Auszeichnung ist eine große Bestätigung für unser gemeinsames Engagement.“ Sie zeige, dass mit „Urban KI“ ein Projekt geschaffen worden sei, dass den Nerv getroffen habe.\nGelsenkirchen-Newsletter: Jetzt anmelden!\nNachrichten, Service, Reportagen: Jeden Tag wissen, was in unserer Stadt los ist.\nBereits seit 2017 zeichnet DDW innovative Unternehmen aller Größen und Branchen aus, die mit ihren Konzepten, Technologien und Lösungen als Impulsgeber voranschreiten. Der Festakt zur Preisverleihung findet am 14. November in Berlin statt - und das diesmal mit Gelsenkirchener Beteiligung..\nWeitere Infos im Netz: https://www.innovator-des-jahres.com/innovator/urban-ki/",

    "title": "Warm weather wreaks havoc on some B.C. ski hills as lack of snow leaves trails barren",
    "text": "VANCOUVER — British Columbia's abnormally warm winter has left local ski resorts grappling with a lack of snow during the holiday tourism season, as resorts struggle to keep runs open. Fewer than half of Whistler Blackcomb's trails are open, while Vancouver's Mount Seymour is closed entirely while it waits for better conditions. Warmth related to the El Niño climate phenomenon this week has pushed temperatures to record highs in regions including Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, the Sunshine Coast and the Okanagan. In Whistler, 120 kilometres north of Vancouver, Environment Canada was reporting no snow on the ground on Christmas Day, compared to 40 centimetres last Christmas. On Thursday, the Whistler Blackcomb resort reported 117 of its 275 trails were open, as well as only 42 per cent of its terrain. Warm weather has hit Metro Vancouver's three main ski hills even harder, with Cypress and Grouse mountains operating only one or two runs each. Mount Seymour closed entirely on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, pending more snow. James Shalman, general manager at Apex Mountain Resort in the Okanagans, says resorts across the province are \"definitely behind the 8-ball\" because of the warm weather, with visitors lost during the holidays unlikely to return later in the season. \"All resorts in B.C. are very reliant on the Christmas holidays as a significant portion of their financial picture for the season,\" Shalman said. \"This is not something where you can make up what you're down during Christmas break. You won't make that up later in the season, even if we get amazing snowfall in January, February, March.\" Apex on Thursday had about a third of its roughly 79 runs open, a stark contrast from 2022 when every run was open in the first week of December thanks to heavy snowfalls. Shalman said Apex had significant snow-making capacity and used it to combat the lack of precipitation, but there were weeks this month where the temperatures were too warm to make snow. \"I mean, we are essentially snow farmers,\" he says. \"We're Mother Nature-dependent, and we just have to take what we get.\" At Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, management warned skiers of \"thin snow coverage\" for what little of the hill was open. Several resorts have been offering discounted passes and tickets to entice skiers to visit. \"Rain's the star of the show today,\" Cypress Mountain's update on Thursday said, noting that night skiing had been cancelled. Environment Canada meteorologist Brian Proctor said that in addition to El Niño, a ridge of high pressure had created a \"blocking pattern\" across much of North America. That was preventing the warm air generated by El Niño from passing over mountains and continuing inland. Proctor said it meant the warm air mass had lingered over B.C., unable to go east due to high pressure acting like \"a wall.\" He said Environment Canada's long-term forecast called for more seasonal temperatures to return for the first week of January, bringing potential snowfall to higher elevations in the Interior. But Proctor said snowfall was less certain for coastal areas in coming weeks, adding that skiers and resorts should temper expectations. \"We may see potential for some snowfall,\" Proctor says. \"But really longer term it does look like an El Niño winter at this point in time, continuing and remaining fairly significant into the early spring.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 29, 2023.

    "text": "Sunehri Masjid Demolition: NDMC Proposes To Bulldoze 150-Year-Old Mosque, Seeks Public Opinion; Owaisi Slams Decision\nSunehri Masjid Demolition: The New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) sought public opinion on its proposed demolition of the Sunehri Bagh Masjid, which is located near the Parliament. In a notice issued on Sunday, the civic body officials invited citizen’s objections and suggestions on the matter by January 1. The NDMC stated that the mosque is leading to traffic congestion and removing the same will help in traffic management in the area.\nThe NDMC received hundreds of suggestions from Sunday on the email ID, [email protected] , requesting the civic body to not demolish the historical structure. Most of the emails received were from Muslim organisations and minority welfare bodies, news agency PTI reported.\nNDMC chairman Amit Yadav answered a question about the possible demolition of the mosque at the budget press conference. “We have sought public feedback on the Sunehri Masjid. We had got a request from the Delhi Traffic Police on traffic snarls being reported around the area. We had started the process and sought comments from various stakeholders. We had also approached the religious committee but the Delhi Waqf Board went to the court over the matter,” he said.\nAmit Yadav said that NDMC has requested public opinion on the issue and following the proper procedure. The public opinion will be reviewed and the heritage committee will also consider it.\nHistorical Importance Of Sunehri Masjid Sunehri Masjid is located in a green circle where six roads meet in Lutyens’ Delhi. Next to it are the IAF headquarters and Udyog Bhawan. The mosque dates back to pre-independent India and is listed as a Grade-III Heritage building as per a 2009 notification of the government.\nIt is more than 150 years old and was built during the Mughal era by Roshan-ud-Daula, a nobleman. The mosque has a historical and cultural significance, as it was one of the places of worship that the British agreed to spare when they acquired the land around Delhi in 1911.\nThe Sunheri Masjid also hosted freedom fighters like Maulana Hasrat Mohani, who coined the slogan “Inquilab Zindabad” and moved the resolution for complete independence from the British in 1921.\nMeanwhile, the Delhi Waqf Board claims ownership of the land on which the mosque is built and challenged the NDMC’s notification in the Delhi High Court. The imam of the mosque, Abdul Aziz, has denied that the mosque causes traffic congestion and has submitted evidence to the NDMC.\nReactions To NDMC’s Proposed Demolition Plan Of Sunehri Masjid Several Muslim organisations, minority groups, history lovers and Muslims have objected to the demolition of the mosque and asked NDMC to change its proposed plan. The NDMC’s notification about the demolition also raised criticism from the political sphere where several Muslim MPs raised concerns about the decision.\nLok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi also wrote to the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC)’s chief architect opposing the proposal to remove Sunehri Bagh’s Sunehri Masjid from the list of heritage buildings by the national capital’s civic body.\n“It is not only unfortunate but astounding that the Council thinks that a mosque that has been functioning for the past 200 years is an “obstruction.” It is also unfortunate that the Council has ignored its duty to conserve the heritage and beauty of the capital city,” Owaisi said.\nLok Sabha MP from Amroha Danish Ali also raised objections to the proposed removal of the Sunehri Bagh Masjid in the national capital, saying the mosque has historical and archaeological importance.",
