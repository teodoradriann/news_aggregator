    "title": "Giga ML Aims to Revolutionize LLM Deployment for Enterprises | Robots.net",
    "text": "AI technology has been gaining significant traction in recent years, particularly in the form of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. According to a recent survey of approximately 1,000 enterprise organizations, around 67.2% have identified the adoption of LLMs as a top priority by early 2024. Key Takeaway Giga ML is addressing the challenges of data privacy and customization faced by enterprises in adopting LLMs. Challenges in LLM Deployment Despite the growing interest in LLM adoption, businesses are facing barriers related to customization, flexibility, and the preservation of company knowledge and intellectual property. These challenges have hindered the smooth deployment of LLMs into production environments. Introducing Giga ML In response to these challenges, Varun Vummadi and Esha Manideep Dinne founded Giga ML, a startup focused on developing a platform that enables companies to deploy LLMs on-premise. This approach aims to reduce costs and uphold privacy standards during the deployment process. Giga ML’s Offerings Giga ML provides its own series of LLMs, known as the “X1 series,” designed for tasks such as code generation and addressing common customer queries. The startup claims that these models, built on Meta’s Llama 2, outperform popular LLMs on specific benchmarks, particularly the MT-Bench test set for dialogs. Privacy and Customization Giga ML’s mission is to facilitate the safe and efficient deployment of LLMs on enterprises’ on-premises infrastructure or virtual private clouds. By offering an easy-to-use API, Giga ML simplifies the process of training, fine-tuning, and running LLMs, thereby eliminating associated hassles. Furthermore, Giga ML emphasizes the privacy advantages of running models offline, which is likely to be a compelling factor for many businesses. Predibase, a low-code AI development platform, found that a significant portion of enterprises are hesitant to use commercial LLMs due to concerns about sharing sensitive or proprietary data with vendors. Future Plans Giga ML, backed by approximately $3.74 million in VC funding from investors such as Nexus Venture Partners, Y Combinator, and Liquid 2 Ventures, intends to expand its team and bolster product research and development. The company also aims to support its customer base, which currently includes undisclosed enterprise companies in the finance and healthcare sectors.",

    "title": "Ukraine minister, responding to Pope Francis, says Kyiv will never raise white flag",
    "text": "(Reuters) – Ukraine’s foreign minister, responding to Pope Francis’s call to show “the courage of the white flag” and negotiate an end to the war with Russia, said on Sunday that Kyiv would never capitulate and told the Vatican to pay special heed to its role in World War Two.\nFrancis made the comments in an interview made available in part at the weekend. He responded to a presenter’s suggestion by saying that when things were not going well for a party to a conflict “you have to have the courage to negotiate”.\nForeign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, writing on social media platform X, said that the strong person in any dispute “stands on the side of good rather than attempting to put them on the same footing and call it ‘negotiations'”.\n“Our flag is a yellow and blue one,” Kuleba wrote in English, referring to the Ukrainian national flag. “This is the flag by which we live, die, and prevail. We shall never raise any other flags.”\nKuleba also pointed to allegations that Pope Pius XII failed to take action against Nazi tyranny in World War Two.\n“At the same time, when it comes to the white flag, we know this Vatican’s strategy from the first half of the twentieth century,” he wrote.\n“I urge (the Vatican) to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past and to support Ukraine and its people in their just struggle for their lives.”\nThat was a reference to longstanding arguments that Pius took no action despite evidence that emerged during the war of the extent of the Holocaust. A letter made public last year from the Vatican archives appeared to show that Pius was made aware of details of Nazi actions to exterminate Jews as early as 1942.\nThe head of Ukraine’s five million-strong eastern rite Catholic Church, Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, also rejected the pope’s comments.\n“Ukraine is wounded, but not conquered! Ukraine is exhausted, but it stands and will stand!” the church’s website quoted Shevchuk as saying in New York.\n“Believe me, no one has any idea of surrendering.”\nZELENSKIY’S PEACE PLAN\nUkraine has been unable to repel Russian forces since Moscow’s full-scale invasion two years ago, but rejects negotiations while Moscow’s troops remain in the slightly less than 20% of its territory they hold.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s peace plan calls for the withdrawal of Russian troops from all of Ukraine and the restoration of its state borders. The Kremlin has ruled out engaging in peace talks on terms set by Kyiv.\nThe pope’s interview was believed to be the first time Francis has used terms like “white flag” or “defeated” in discussing the Ukraine war, though he has referred in the past to the need for talks.\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said on Saturday the pope had picked up on the term “white flag” spoken by the interviewer and used it “to indicate a stop to hostilities (and) a truce achieved with the courage of negotiations”.\nThe pope has upset Ukrainian officials several times in the war, including his call last year to Russian youth to take pride as heirs of tsars like Peter the Great, held up by President Vladimir Putin as an example to justify his actions in Ukraine.\nEuropean officials supporting Ukraine in efforts to evict Russian troops denounced the pope’s latest comments.\n“How about, for balance, encouraging Putin to have the courage to withdraw his army from Ukraine?,” Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski wrote on X. “Peace would immediately ensue without the need for negotiations.”\nLatvian President Edgars Rinkevics, also writing on X, said “One must fight it (evil) and defeat it, so that the evil raises the white flag and capitulates.”\n(Additional reporting by Giulia Segreti; Writing by Ron Popeski; Editing by Frances Kerry)",

Il presidio si è tenuto in place des Franchises ad Aosta. «Siamo qui per dare voce a tutti i lavoratori e le lavoratrici - dicono le segretarie regionali di Cgil e Uil, Vilma Gaillard e Ramira Bizzotto - la manovra del Governo non dà risposte , non mette in campo risorse, non parla di stabilizzazione dei precari, mancano gli investimenti per la sicurezza, non c'è un piano industriale. Il precariato continua a crescere e aumentano i tagli nei servizi».\nLe due segretarie sottolineano poi: « Per i lavoratori lo sciopero è un sacrificio , visto la decurtazione in busta paga, ma se continuiamo a farli è perché ovviamente continua ad essercene necessità. Lo sciopero è un diritto costituzionale. Non si può e non si deve stare zitti».\nUn secondo presidio si è tenuto anche a Donnas, alla casa di riposo. Intanto, per il 12 dicembre è già stato annunciato uno sciopero nella casa di riposo di Aosta J.B.

    "title": "UK opens aesthetic medicine to nurses, encouraging competition… Safety management by an independent organization | Dong-A Ilbo",
    "text": "[미용성형 공화국의 그림자] Some nurses, including beauty treatments, are allowed to perform cosmetic procedures\nSome say, “Impose a special consumption tax on aesthetic medicine.”\nThere is also an argument that “we must invest in essential medical support.”\n“Discuss a personalized treatment plan with a registered aesthetic nurse.”\nUnion Station Station in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on the 16th of last month (local time). A promotional message like this was hung at a beauty clinic in a historic underground shopping mall. Inside, two or three white women were waiting to receive a procedure from a nurse.\nRecently, it has been pointed out in the government and medical circles that the problem of the ‘cosmetic plastic surgery republic’ will be resolved only by changing the reality in which general practitioners who have just graduated from medical school earn about 15 million won per month at aesthetic clinics, making more money than specialists in essential medicine.\nOne of the solutions is ‘opening beauty medicine’. In the Canadian province of Ontario, some qualified nurses are allowed to independently perform cosmetic procedures such as Botox injections. In places like the United States and Australia, nurses can perform cosmetic procedures on a limited basis.\nHowever, it is pointed out that in order to prevent controversy over poor procedures like network beauty clinics from erupting, qualifications should be opened but quality should be strictly controlled. In the UK, where nurses are allowed to perform cosmetic procedures, the Quality Commission (CQC), an independent organization, manages medical practices, including cosmetic procedures, to ensure that they do not harm patient safety.\nThere is also an opinion to impose a special consumption tax on aesthetic medicine and use it to support essential medical care. Jeong Jae-hoon, a professor of preventive medicine at Korea University, said, “General practitioners working in aesthetic medicine also use the healthcare system while receiving education and obtaining a medical license.” He added, “We can pay more taxes to make this system sustainable and invest it in essential healthcare.” “There is,” he said. However, with the introduction of the special consumption tax, it is pointed out that aesthetic medicine is already paying the value-added tax (10%), which is exempted for general medical treatment. There are also concerns that imposing additional taxes will only increase the burden on consumers.\nThe Korean government announced its policy to improve the ‘focus on cosmetic surgery’ and to allow some cosmetic procedures, such as Botox and fillers, to be performed without a doctor’s license in the essential medical package announced in February this year. At the time, Park Min-soo, Second Vice Minister of Health and Welfare, said, “The problem of essential medical care is that doctors are leaving the cosmetic surgery market with high income and good work-life balance,” and emphasized that they would lower expected income through competition. However, doctors immediately opposed this, saying, “patient safety cannot be guaranteed.” The government only reaffirmed the general openness policy in the ‘First Implementation Plan for Medical Reform’ released in August this year, but is not speeding up discussions on the specific scope of openness.\nReporter Park Gyeong-min mean@donga.com\nToronto = Reporter Cho Yu-ra jyr0101@donga.com\ngreat\n0 dog\nI’m sad\n0 dog\nI’m angry\n0 dog\nI recommend it\ndog\nHot news now",

    "text": "(Reuters) – Air Methods, a private equity-owned medical helicopter company, said on Thursday it has emerged from bankruptcy nearly two months after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\nThe restructuring process cut about $1.7 billion of the company’s debt, Air Methods said. The firm entered bankruptcy with debt of about $2.24 billion.\nThe business had suffered due to rising interest rates, higher labor costs and a recent U.S. ban on “surprise” medical bills, which are typically sent to patients who unwittingly receive transportation services or treatment from an out-of-network provider, despite visiting a hospital or other medical facility that is in-network for their insurance.\nLenders and noteholders of the company now own Air Methods, according to the terms of the reorganization. Some of the new owners are injecting about $185 million into the company, Air Methods said.\nThe company provides air medical services through its fleet of 365 medical helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft.\nAir Methods was acquired by private equity firm American Securities in 2017.\n(Reporting by Sriparna Roy in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)",

    "title": "Cataluña extiende los avisos naranjas y amarillos por lluvias torrenciales hasta el domingo",
    "text": "El Servei Meteorològic de Cataluña ha activado decenas de avisos amarillos y naranja ante el riesgo de que la DANA que esta semana ha azotado España siga dejando lluvias torrenciales en el territorio durante los próximos días. Los pronósticos apuntan a que el temporal se seguirá extendiendo hasta como mínimo el domingo, por lo que se han activado varios avisos ante la posibilidad de que las lluvias dejen más de 100 litros por metro cuadrado en algunos puntos del litoral catalán. Por el momento, las zonas con más riesgo se concentran en el extremo sur, incluyendo el Tarragonès, el Baix Camp, el Priorat, Ribera d'Ebre, Terra Alta, Baix Ebre y Montsià. En Barcelona, se ha activado un aviso amarillo para viernes, sábado y domingo. Este viernes hay siete comarcas catalanas en alerta naranja por el paso de esta DANA. En el Montsià, Baix Ebre y Terra Alta, hay activo un aviso naranja por acumulación de lluvias en tanto que podrían superarse los 100 litros por metro cuadrado a lo largo de la jornada. También destaca otra alerta naranja por intensidad de las lluvias en toda la zona (desde el Tarragonès hasta el Baix Camp, el Priorat, Ribera d'Ebre), dado que entre este mediodía y la tarde podrían producirse descargas de hasta 40 litros en tan solo 30 minutos. En todas estas zonas, las autoridades piden a los residentes extremar las precauciones durante la jornada de este viernes. Este viernes también hay 14 comarcas más en alerta amarilla: el Barcelonès, Baix Llobregat, Vallès Occidental, Garraf, Alt Penedès, Anoia, Alt Camp, Baix Penedès, Conca de Barberà, Segarra, Urgell, Garrigues, Pla d'Urgell y Segrià. El aviso se extiende para toda la jornada del viernes y, en varios casos, también de cara al sábado. En estos puntos se esperan precipitaciones abundantes que en algunos casos podrían adquirir un carácter torrencial. Según datos de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología, en el litoral y prelitoral de Barcelona se podrían registrar acumulaciones de hasta 20 litros por metro cuadrado en una hora. En el conjunto de España, este viernes hay cinco comunidades autónomas en alerta por el paso de la DANA y al menos un aviso rojo activado en el litoral de Huelva, donde se podrían dar acumulaciones de más de 140 litros por metro cuadrado en tan solo unas horas. En localidades como Cartaya ya se han acumulado más de 117 litros por metro cuadrado en menos de tres horas, de los cuales 70 en un hora. También se están registrando importantes trombas marinas asociadas a este evento. Los pronósticos sobre la evolución de esta DANA aún son inciertos pero, según los modelos más actualizados, todo apunta a que el temporal seguirá abriéndose paso durante el fin de semana. El domingo, de hecho, el Servei Meteorològic de Cataluña ha activado un aviso amarillo en todo el litoral y prelitoral catalán, desde el Alt Empordà hasta les Terres de l'Ebre, por intensidad de lluvias. Para entonces hay casi una veintena de comarcas en aviso amarillo y tres más, situadas en el extremo sur, en aviso naranja.",
