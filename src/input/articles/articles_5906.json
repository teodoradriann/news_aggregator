In his voluntary work as a special constable for another force and in his leadership of Special Constabulary and Volunteer Police Cadet programmes within Greater Manchester, he has improved service delivery to neighbourhoods – ultimately helping to build the public’s trust and confidence in policing.\"\nGreater Manchester&apos;s top cop, Chief Constable Stephen Watson, thanked Insp Hare for his tireless work - and said he was known for &apos;doing it right and doing it well&apos;.\nHe said: \"Inspector Hare is determined, enthusiastic, and tenacious in his service to the King and the public. Known by colleagues and partners for &apos;doing it right and doing it well&apos;.\n\"He is a credit to Greater Manchester Police and his previous force. Public order policing is of huge importance in the city of Manchester district and his contribution has undoubtedly made the locality a safer place to live, to work, and to visit.\n\"On behalf of Greater Manchester Police, I thank him for his service and to the voluntary contribution he has made through his involvement with Citizens in Policing programmes.\"\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.

    "text": "El Papa conmemora el 8 de junio el Encuentro de paz por Tierra Santa\nSalvatore Cernuzio - Ciudad del Vaticano\nMismo lugar, misma fecha, mismo escenario devastador que hace diez años. El próximo sábado 8 de junio, a las 9.30 horas, el Papa Francisco acudirá a los Jardines Vaticanos para conmemorar lo que muchos recuerdan como uno de los gestos de paz más significativos de su pontificado, el encuentro con el difunto presidente de Israel, Shimon Peres, y Mahmoud Abbas, presidente del Estado de Palestina, para invocar juntos la paz para Oriente Medio.\nEl encuentro fue una invocación conjunta de la paz para Oriente Medio. Al acto, que siguió al viaje del Pontífice a Jerusalén, asistieron también el Patriarca Bartolomé I y una representación de cristianos, judíos y musulmanes de Tierra Santa, que siguieron los momentos de oración interreligiosa y también la ceremonia de plantación del olivo. Y precisamente en el lugar donde se plantó el árbol, no lejos de la sede de la Academia de las Ciencias, se celebrará el 8 de junio -como confirmó el director de la Oficina de Prensa del Vaticano, Matteo Bruni- la conmemoración de aquel acontecimiento, en este momento difícil y preocupante por la guerra entre israelíes y palestinos.\nEl valor de hacer la paz\nUn momento en el que adquieren relevancia profética las palabras pronunciadas por Francisco hace diez años: «Sí al respeto de los acuerdos y no a las provocaciones. Hacer la paz requiere coraje». Precisamente la palabra «coraje» fue la más pronunciada en su discurso a los dos líderes israelíes y palestinos, junto a los cuales el Sucesor de Pedro elevó una súplica a Dios: «¡Ayúdanos! Danos la paz, enséñanos la paz, condúcenos a la paz. Abre nuestros ojos y nuestros corazones y danos el valor de decir: 'Nunca más la guerra'». A continuación se produjeron los abrazos finales entre el Papa y Peres, que había declarado que «la paz exige sacrificio y compromiso», y Abu Mazen, que exigió enérgicamente «libertad para el Estado de Palestina».\nLas oraciones de judíos, cristianos y musulmanes\nEl encuentro, muy deseado por el Papa Francisco, se desarrolló en tres momentos, cada uno de ellos dedicado a la oración de una de las tres comunidades religiosas, en orden cronológico: judía, recitada por un rabino; Christian, con el entonces Patriarca Latino de Jerusalén, Fouad Twal, quien leyó las palabras de San Juan Pablo II; Musulmán, con una invocación a Alá en árabe. Siguieron apretones de manos, gestos de paz, discursos del Papa, de Bartolomé, de los dos presidentes, recibidos por Jorge Mario Bergoglio en Santa Marta antes del acto público.\nInvocación a la paz\nAquel día se encendieron tantas esperanzas, que se apagaron pocas semanas después con el estallido de un nuevo conflicto, con incursiones, asaltos y explosiones, que causaron, entre otras cosas, 100.000 desplazados. Luego, en 2015, se temió incluso una nueva intifada debido a otra serie de enfrentamientos, que se recrudecieron por el fracaso de las nuevas conversaciones de paz y causaron más víctimas. Y así durante años, alternando momentos de tensión con momentos de tregua, hasta el 7 de octubre de 2023, día en que se reabrirá el abismo y será urgente una oración coral para que la paz vuelva a la tierra de Jesús.\nGracias por haber leído este artículo.

    "text": "A pillar of the Connecticut family law community, Attorney Lisa Faccadio, decided to merge her successful law practice with another in order to spend more time doing what she loves, both at work and at home. The result? An even more powerful force for good in the sphere of family law.\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nHartford, CT, December 28, 2023— Two is better than one, and that’s certainly the case with the recent Freed Marcroft and Lisa Faccadio merger. These two incredible family law practices are coming together to offer more experience, more resources, and more passion to families in Connecticut who are dealing with divorce and custody issues.\nAttorney Lisa Faccadio is renowned in the family law world for her famous work ethic (she rises at 3am most days to get on the treadmill and begin reviewing her docket), her over forty years of private practice, and her status as a Special Master with Connecticut courts, which she has held for over twenty-five years. A Special Master is an extremely experienced lawyer that judges trust to help resolve particularly complex family disputes via settlement.\nLisa earned her Juris Doctorate at Western New England College School of Law in 1977. She has since served not only as a family lawyer and Special Master, but also as an adjunct professor for the University of New Haven, Baypath College, Mitchell College, and Quinnipiac University, as a speaker at the National Business Institute, as a member of the Standing Committee on Recommendations for Admission to the Bar of Middlesex County, and as the President of the Connecticut Bar and Middlesex Bar Association (2010-11).\nHer list of accomplishments and accolades is vast; this experience and deep knowledge of family court, together with her diligence, and her dedication to her clients, is what truly distinguishes Lisa above the rest. It’s what made her own family law practice flourish!\nHowever, when Lisa decided that she wanted to spend more time with her family, but still serve families across the state and do the work she loved, she chose to merge her firm with Freed Marcoft. The firm’s mission spoke to her. Their exclusive concentration on the field of family law, together with their own attorneys’ knowledge and over 70 years of combined experience that mirrors her own decades of practice, made them the top choice for her next season of life and work.\n“She’s someone who has dedicated her entire life to this one thing, so to have her with us, to add her to the depth of the bench that we have, is really monumental. This is a milestone for our firm.” – Natasha Roggi, Director of Operations\nFreed Marcroft has been named the Best Law Firm by the Hartford Readers’ Poll from 2014 to 2023, and is recognized as the authority on divorce and family law in Connecticut. They are equally thrilled by the new partnership; it’s a huge honor for them to be able to join with Lisa and her small but mighty team in order to better serve clients, and to allow Lisa to focus on doing what she loves, which is going to court. It was an easy decision for both parties because of the amount of alignment they would have with their values and strategy moving forward!\nEvery day, the attorneys at Freed Marcroft hold a roundtable discussion about current cases; they share information and advice, and all of the attorneys benefit from the other attorneys’ familiarity with certain cases, judges, and etc. Adding Lisa and her firm to this daily discussion is just one small example of how the merger is going to provide clients with the most elite, effective representation possible.\nFreed Marcroft is a Connecticut family law firm that believes everyone has one life, and supports people making the brave decision to live it the way they choose through transformative divorce that aligns with their individual goals for their futures. Their clients trust them with the hardest and bravest things they have ever done, and they (and now with Lisa Faccadio) will honor that trust by combining their legacy acumen with empathy and being their seasoned guide through the process.

    "text": "The accuracy of skin cancer diagnosis varied by lesion type, physician specialty and experience, and examination method, with the greatest accuracy observed for dermatologists using dermoscopy, according to findings from a systematic review and meta-analysis.\nAcross 100 studies, experienced dermatologists had 5.7-fold higher odds of accurate diagnosis of melanoma using dermoscopy compared with clinical examination, and 13.3-fold higher odds of accurate diagnosis of melanoma using dermoscopic images compared with primary care physicians, reported Maria L. Wei, MD, PhD, of the University of California San Francisco, and colleagues.\nExperienced dermatologists also had 2.5-fold higher odds of accurate diagnosis of keratinocytic carcinomas using in-person dermoscopy and dermoscopic images compared with in-person clinical examination and images, they noted in JAMA Dermatology .\nUsing clinical examination and images, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing melanoma were 76.9% and 89.1% for experienced dermatologists, 78.3% and 66.2% for inexperienced dermatologists, and 37.5% and 84.6% for primary care physicians, respectively. When using dermoscopy and dermoscopic images, sensitivity and specificity were 85.7% and 81.3%, 78% and 69.5%, and 49.5% and 91.3%, respectively, for the three groups.\nFor diagnosing keratinocytic carcinomas, the sensitivity and specificity with experienced dermatologists using clinical examination and clinical images were 79% and 89.1%, respectively, and 83.7% and 87.4% with dermoscopy and dermoscopic images. For primary care physicians using dermoscopy, the sensitivity and specificity were 81.4% and 80.1%.\n\"We found significant differences in diagnostic accuracy by different physician specialty; accuracy improved when dermoscopic methods were used, and improved further with in-person dermoscopy. These results suggest that clinical examination combined with dermoscopy likely yields better accuracy than either method alone,\" wrote Wei and colleagues.\nUsing the naked eye is the current standard of care for skin cancer examination, and histopathologic testing remains the gold standard for skin cancer diagnosis, the authors explained. As a non-invasive in vivo magnification method, \" adding dermoscopy to conventional naked-eye clinical examination in melanoma screening has been associated with more than 40% fewer biopsy procedures performed by dermatologists.\"\n\"Developing technologies could assist in augmenting primary care physicians' diagnostic performance, increase effectiveness of examination, and increase equitable access to high-quality skin examinations,\" they noted. \"Furthermore, as suggested by the workplace screening study ... and expert consensus panels , a risk-stratified targeted skin-screening approach by dermatologists may be an effective means of detecting skin cancer at a level sufficient to affect outcomes.\"\nMarcus Butler, MD, of the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto, told MedPage Today that \"given the increasing incidence of skin cancers in the aging population in North America and elsewhere, this study provides benchmarks for efforts to improve the diagnosis of skin cancers.\"\n\"Such efforts should include specialized dermatological training of primary care providers with dermoscopy, increasing access to experienced dermatologists, and further investigations of novel technologies such as artificial intelligence to augment the high standard of examination by an experienced dermatologist with dermoscopy,\" he said.\nFor this systematic review and meta-analysis, Wei and colleagues searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science and included 100 cross-sectional and case-control studies, randomized clinical trials, and nonrandomized controlled trials that used dermatologists or primary care physicians to examine keratinocytic and/or melanocytic skin lesions.\nNo studies directly comparing dermatologists with primary care physicians using clinical examination/images met eligibility criteria.\nWei and team acknowledged limitations to their study, including the low numbers of physicians in some studies, a lack of data on participants' race and ethnicity, and regional variations in the use of dermoscopy, which is familiar to at least 50% of primary care physicians in Australia compared with less than 10% in the U.S.",

    "text": "El Gobierno cubano confirmó este jueves que un destacamento naval ruso de tres barcos y un submarino nuclear, visitarán el puerto de La Habana entre el próximo 12 y el 17 de junio.\nEl Ministerio de Exteriores informó en un comunicado que la “visita se corresponde con las históricas relaciones de amistad entre Cuba y la Federación de Rusia y se acoge estrictamente a las regulaciones internacionales” suscritas por La Habana.\nLa nota no habla de ejercicios militares, los que desmiente las informaciones publicadas recientemente por medios estadounidenses y sus aliados, en las que se apuntaba que barcos rusos viajaban hacia el mar Caribe para participar en unas maniobras militares y que podían parar en puertos de Cuba y Venezuela.\n“Ninguno de los navíos es portador de armas nucleares, por lo que su escala en nuestro país no representa amenaza para la región”, aclaró la Cancillería cubana, que indicó asimismo que “las visitas de unidades navales de otros países es una práctica histórica” con naciones con quienes el país mantiene “relaciones de amistad y colaboración”.\nEl submarino nuclear rusos Kazan, no lleva armas nucleares en su visita a Cuba. Foto Archivo Los barcos que componen el destacamento naval ruso son, según el comunicado, la fragata Gorshkov, el submarino de propulsión nuclear Kazan, el buque petrolero de la flota Pashin y el remolcador de salvamento Nikolai Chiker.\nAsí son los barcos rusos que llegan a Cuba La fragata rusa Almirante Gorshkov, la nave líder de la última generación de fragatas de la armada rusa, efectuó en enero de 2023 un ejercicio para entrenar el lanzamiento de misiles hipersónicos Tsirkon en el Atlántico mediante una simulación por ordenador.\nEn febrero de 2023 participó en unos ejercicios conjuntos junto a Sudáfrica y China, y en marzo pasado se sumó a los ejercicios conjuntos que llevaron a cabo las armadas de China, Irán y Rusia en el golfo de Omán.\nPor su parte, el Kazan es un submarino de propulsión nuclear con capacidad para disparar misiles de crucero que entró en funcionamiento en 2021.\nEl comunicado del Ministerio de Exteriores de Cuba indicó que a su llegada al puerto de La Habana el 12 de junio, la fragata Gorshkov disparará 21 salvas “como saludo a la Nación”, gesto que será replicado desde las fortalezas de la bahía capitalina.\nAgregó que durante la visita rusa los marinos cumplirán un programa de actividades con visitas de cortesía y recorridos de interés histórico y cultural.",
