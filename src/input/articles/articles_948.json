    "text": "Repairs are now complete on a Fortis gas line that was damaged in Comox on July 9.\nFortis told the Record that a third party had damaged the gas main on Comox Avenue near Glacier View Road on July 9. Construction crews are working on the Comox Valley Sewer Conveyance upgrade project in the area.\nFortis Corporate Communications Officer Nicholas Insley provided an update on Wednesday evening, saying that \"when our system is damaged, there are a number of steps that FortisBC takes to restore service safely and as quickly as possible.\n\"Our first job is to make the situation safe and determine the best way to stop the flow of gas due to the damage caused by an external party,\" he said in the update. \"As required to start repairs, we’ll need to shut down the affected section of our system. Once we complete repairs and reactivate the impacted portion of the system, our crews restore service by visiting each affected home or business to turn gas back on at the meter and relight all affected appliances.\"\nThe damage to the gas mine affected about 40 customers, and repairs were complete at around 6 p.m. At the time, Fortis hoped to have service restored by 8:30 p.m. on Wednesday.\nInsley reminded people that if they smell rotten eggs or hear gas escaping to \"stop what you’re doing, go outside and dial 9-1-1 or call FortisBC’s 24-hour emergency line at 1-800-663-9911.\"\nHe also recommended to call BC 1 Call at 1-800-474-6886 before digging to get info about buried gas lines and other utility infrastructure to prevent damage.\n\"We thank residents in the area for their patience as our crews work(ed) to complete the necessary repairs safely and as quickly as possible,\" he said.",

    "text": "Fútbol/Premier.- (Crónica) El Arsenal falla ante el West Ham y el Tottenham cae en Brighton Europa Press Tiempo de lectura: 2' Actualizado 23:26 El Arsenal encajó su primera derrota en casa esta Premier al caer (0-2) contra el West Ham, cediendo así el liderato que asaltó el Liverpool en el 'Boxing Day', mientras que el Tottenham sufrió otro correctivo (4-2) ante el Brighton. Los de Mikel Arteta se vieron superados por un West Ham que sacó petróleo a sus pocas ocasiones y se defendió con uñas y dientes. El derbi londinense se lo quedaron los 'hammers' con el tanto a los 13 minutos de Tomas Soucek, mal defendido por los locales y validado con suspense por el VAR, y el cabezazo de Konstantinos Mavropanos. El Arsenal dominó y tuvo muchas ocasiones, sin acierto en especial Saka, y se vio con ese 2-0 en el minuto 55. Areola bajo palos mantuvo la renta de un West Ham que salió sexto de casa de su vecino y fallando de penalti el tercero. El Arsenal se queda en 40 puntos, por los 42 del Liverpool, con 39 Aston Villa y 37, pero con un partido menos por el Mundial de Clubes, el Manchester City. En el turno anterior, el Tottenham sufrió otro traspiés que le dejó fuera de la zona de Liga de Campeones (36), al final de la primera vuelta de liga. El equipo londinense cedió al sur de Inglaterra en una gran actuación de los locales en el Amex Stadium. Jack Hinshelwood y Joao Pedro pusieron un 2-0 a los 20 minutos y el tercero fue de Pervis Estupiñán en el 63'. Una losa para unos 'Spurs' que habían mejorado en el segundo tiempo, con un Richarlison sin puntería eso sí. Un nuevo penalti de Pedro supuso el 4-0, que maquilló el Tottenham en los últimos 10 minutos. El Brighton venció así tras tres jornadas sin hacerlo para sumar 30 puntos, octavo en la tabla. --RESULTADOS DE LA JORNADA 19 EN LA PREMIER LEAGUE. -Martes. Newcastle - Nottingham Forest 1-3.

    "text": "×\nPlease verify\nEach day we overwhelm your brains with the content you've come to love from the Louder with Crowder Dot Com website.\nBut Facebook is...you know, Facebook. Their algorithm hides our ranting and raving as best it can. The best way to stick it to Zuckerface?\nSign up for the LWC News Blast! Get your favorite right-wing commentary delivered directly to your inbox!\nArticles\nFebruary 23, 2024\nWatch MSNBC's latest freakout: You're a Christian Nationalist if you believe rights come from God and not government\nTell me you have not read any of our founding documents without telling me you have not read any of our founding documents.\nShe will go first:\nAt its very core, the main problem with Progressivism is the belief that the Government is de facto God. And when you believe that, there is no such thing as “inalienable” rights that you are born with. And because of that, rights can change as society “progresses.”\nThe problem with all that is that none of that is true. This country was founded on the idea that humans are born with rights and that the government's sole purpose is to protect those rights. And when you are born with something, it’s not the government's right to take that away.\nSo even though this has been common sense since this country's founding and everyone who has read this little thing called “\nThe Declaration Of Independence '' would know all that - a guest on MSNBC is still freaking out over that realization.\n“The one thing that unites them as Christian nationalists…. is that they believe our rights as Americans, as all human beings, don’t come from any earthly authority. They don’t come from Congress, they don’t come from the Supreme Court, they come from God,” she said.\nSay it with me: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed, by their Creator, with certain unalienable rights.”\nIf she believes our rights come from SCOTUS and Congress, does that mean that abortion is not a right? Because by her moral reasoning, that would be 100 percent true.\nWhat is she even trying to say here? That government comes before God? Because I think that’s exactly what she is trying to say.\nHow much more clear can our founding documents get?\n“Law of Nature and Nature's God.”\nIs she that naive she has just never read any of these things. I understand there is no requirement to be what one would call “smart” to appear on MSNBC, but this level of ignorance is just astonishing.\nOur money says “In God We Trust.” It does not say “In Congress We Trust.” It does not say “In SCOTUS We Trust.”\nIn other words, it’s not a belief. It’s a fact that this country was founded on the “idea” that rights come from God.\nHonestly, I did not think it was possible to be this naive.\nThe difference between a right and a privilege is that rights cannot be taken away. And by turning the government into God you de facto have no rights, only privileges.\nIt’s baffling that people take issue with any of this. But it’s 2024 and these are the same people that think gender is a conspiracy theory so I guess the foolishness is not that shocking.\nFULL DESPOT!

This is the smallest iOS 18 update we have received till date which hints at minimal focus on new features and primarily aiming to fix any possible stability issues.\niOS 18.6 Update: Brings Major Security Fixes\nApple has confirmed the iOS 18.6 update details with its release notes that tells us more about the new version rolling out. The company says its new update fixes important bugs and security issues.\nAnd one of the issues was linked to the Photos app that has now been resolved. The company also has fixed the security issue that may have enabled attackers to spoof websites on Safari and target devices to control their actions.\nadvetisement In addition to protecting the devices, Apple is also making it possible to download apps from websites, which has become mandatory in the EU regions. You can even install third-party app stores on iPhones in these countries, something that Android has supported for many years. Apple will obviously share its guidelines to make sure that iPhone users don’t fall for the wrong/malicious websites from where they download the apps or the app store itself.\ntop videos View All\nHamas Accused Israel Of Delaying Aid To Gaza, Says May Affect Hostage Release | Gaza Aid | N18G DeepSeek Vs OpenAI | Microsoft And Openai Probe Unauthorized Data Access Linked To Deepseek Ai |N18G DeepSeek: Meet Liang Wenfeng, the mind behind China’s AI startup competing OpenAI | N18G | News18 China’s New Chatbot DeepSeek Sparks Controversy with Built-In Censorship | Dalai Lama | News18 |N18G DeepSeek vs ChatGPT vs Gemini: Who Wins the AI Battle? | AI War | Chinese AI Model Challenge | N18V View all The iOS 18.6 update comes with a download package of 762 MB which is far less than the usual 10GB or more size that we have seen over the previous iOS 18.6 beta updates in the last few weeks.\n The new iOS 26 beta 4 update brings a slew of new features and some design changes that have got people talking. Most of you would remember the Liquid Glass interface that Apple unveiled at the WWDC 25 keynote with the iOS 26 version, and later tweaked to look less glassy but that has now been reverted back to its default state.\nAbout the Author S Aadeetya S Aadeetya, Special Correspondent at News18 Tech, accidentally got into journalism 10 years ago, and since then, has been part of established media houses covering the latest trends in technology and helping friends make the right gadget buy.

    "text": "What makes someone instinctively defend a monster? I don’t mean a legal defense, to which everyone is entitled. Nor do I mean exonerating someone after the facts are known. I’m talking about instinctively defending a monster purely out of some inexplicable affinity with him.\nThat was the spectacle du jour on social media yesterday, when an official Israeli account posted a video of female soldiers as they were taken hostage. The Hamas terrorists taunt and salivate over the women, some of whom are bloodied from the attacks. There was nothing ambiguous about what the fatigue-clad barbarians meant or intended.\nNevertheless, a darkly pedantic argument ensued on Twitter/X. The Israeli account had mistranslated one of the words to suggest the terrorists were specifically pointing out which women were fertile. Hamas apologists took to social media to rain down approbation on the video and those who shared it. They suggested other parts of the video were mistranslated, and therefore that the whole scene was portrayed falsely.\nTo review: The scene they’re talking about is Hamas terrorists taking women hostage during an extremely bloody spree of murder and sexual violence. It was obviously not the case that this video showed anything other than monsters behaving monstrously. There is only one reaction to such a video that marks you as worthy of participating in society, and it is not, as the anti-Zionist twitter horde spat, “hey nobody said the word ‘pregnant,’ you hasbarists!”\nEventually, Palestinians who aren’t Hamasniks logged on to point out that in fact the terrorists were referring to the women essentially as sex slaves and were referencing Islamic scripture. If anything, then, the one modest translation error had underplayed how sick and twisted the Hamasniks’ words were.",
