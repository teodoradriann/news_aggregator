    "text": "The Christian youth organization responsible for Good News Clubs in public schools around the country is celebrating its win in a long-fought battle to ensure equal access to classroom facilities.\nLiberty Counsel, the Christian legal advocacy firm representing Child Evangelism Fellowship, announced in late November its client received a permanent statewide injunction, allowing the Good News Clubs — a weekly extracurricular gathering during which 5- to 12-year-old kids learn Bible lessons, recite memory verses, sing praise songs, and play games — to operate in every school district in Hawaii.\nListen to the latest episode of “Quick Start” 👇\n“This is a welcomed win not only for CEF Hawaii but for all Christian groups in the public square,” Fred Pry, acting vice president of administration for CEF, told The Christian Post . “The Constitution is crystal clear that the government cannot discriminate on the basis of religion or free speech.”\nAs a result of the injunction, Good News Clubs will have the same access to school facilities as any other group.\nIn January, Liberty Counsel filed a lawsuit against Aloha State education officials after four school districts on the islands blocked the Christian clubs from meeting on public campuses. In the legal complaint, attorneys argued that, by affording school access to secular groups while prohibiting faith-based meetings, district officials were violating the First and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\nThe CEF received a preliminary injunction over the summer, ordering the Hawaii Department of Education as well as the six elementary schools named in the complaint to allow — just like any other club — the Good News Clubs to meet on school property. Then, on Nov. 19, a broader permanent injunction ensured the clubs have the right to meet on any public school campus in Hawaii.\nAmidst its success in Hawaii, Liberty Counsel announced it is “preparing another lawsuit against a school district in California.” Attorneys said, “In that district, every view is welcome — except for the Christian club.”\nThis issue has been in the courts for decades. In 2001, the debate over whether Good News Clubs could meet on public school campuses made it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Ultimately, in Good News Clubs v. Milford Central School , the justices ruled 6-3 the school violated the First Amendment rights of Good News Club participants by preventing after-school meetings on campus.\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire’s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app , developed by our parent company, to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***",

    "text": "Turner Aims for Breakout 2025 Season with Cowboys Following Injury Struggles\nPayton Turner, a former first-round pick, is optimistic about his potential with the Dallas Cowboys after struggling with injuries during his time with the New Orleans Saints. The Saints declined his fifth-year option after he played only 15 games and recorded just three sacks in three seasons. Now, under defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus, Turner believes that a different scheme focused on penetration will help unleash his abilities alongside star teammates like Micah Parsons. He’s implemented significant changes to his training and recovery routines to enhance his durability and performance.\n- Turner played a career-high 16 games in 2024.\n- He tied his career-high with two sacks in that same season.\n- Turner aims to overcome past injuries and maintain consistency in performance.\n- He is adapting to a new training routine focused on mobility, nutrition, and injury prevention.\nAs the 2025 season approaches, Turner will seek to solidify his role in the Cowboys' defense, aiming for a breakout year that will validate his potential as a first-round pick.\nBottom LineIf Payton Turner can leverage his new training methods and the Cowboys’ defensive scheme, he may finally reach the expectations set for him as a top draft pick, potentially transforming a one-year deal into a long-term success story.\nRead more at CBSSports.com\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",

    "text": "Forget Spiderman, Superman and Wonder Woman, did you know that we all secretly possess our own superpower? Yep, that's right! And we're not just talking about the usual (and rather unrealistic) choices of invisibility, ability to fly or read minds...let's face it, those are never gonna happen. Instead let's focus on a superpower that you already have; maybe you just didn't know you had it until now! Keep reading for your secret superpower reading, brought to you by ï»¿â€Œï»¿ [YourTango](#)ï»¿â€Œï»¿. Snapshot Survey Thanks for sharing your thoughts! Please subscribe for your personalized newsletter: ARIES (March 21 - April 19) Your superpower is that you're fearless. You probably would run into a burning building to save someone. You take risks, are courageous, and on top of that, you're somewhat of a daredevil. Actually, I'm not sure you're not a superhero, though you certainly have all the personality characteristics for one. TAURUS (April 20 - May 20) Your superpower is your concentration. Once you put your mind to something, there isn't anything you can't achieve. If you could market your focus and drive, it would always sell out. No one should attempt to stand in your way when you're concentrating on a goal because you'll just steamroll right over them. GEMINI (May 21 - June 20) Your superpower is your adaptability. You can fit in and make a name for yourself anywhere. It doesn't matter if you're the new kid in school or a new hire, but it won't take long for you to endear yourself to everyone around you and to rise to the top. You're not thrown by something new; in fact, it excites and challenges you. You may not be able to be a chameleon and blend into the environment but being able to adapt to anything and thrive is amazing. CANCER (June 21 - July 22) You have the superpower of insight. You're able to read between the lines of what people say and do and understand what's really going on. You're able to read people's hearts and understand what they feel, even when they're confused or don't have the ability to be honest with themselves. You can easily get to the essence of the situation and solve the difficulty. LEO (July 23 - August 22) You have the superpower of influence. You're a natural leader and people tend to look up to you and follow you. When you're front and center â€” the place where you feel most at home â€” people can't help but look at you. You guide and influence but you don't take advantage of your power for your own gain... at least you try not to. VIRGO (August 23 - September 22) Your superpower is the ability to fix what is broken; whether it's a teacup or a heart, you instinctively know what to do to make it whole again. You are a healer and a fixer and you make people feel better, sometimes from the things that you do and other times just by your presence. LIBRA (September 23 - October 22) Manifesting is your superpower. You're able to make things happen and get the things you want to the sheer power of visualizing and focusing. Call it the power of positivity or maybe it's just that by believing you bring great things into your life. Keep doing what you're doing because it's working. SCORPIO (October 23 - November 21) Your superpower is your natural charisma. You [draw people to you with your charm](https://www.yourtango.com/200937082/are-your-astrology-signs-sexually-compatible) and your appeal. You seem to have the \"it\" factor, which, coupled with your natural air of mystery, [makes you nearly irresistible](https://www.yourtango.com/2014232483/12-sex-positions-fitting-each-zodiac-sign). You're magnetic and once someone is in your presence, they find it difficult to leave. SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21) Your superpower is your openness which is why you're able to travel the world and never feel anything but at home. You're interested in unfamiliar traditions and customs and you constantly want to learn and experience more. You're not shy but genuinely curious about people. You may not be a sociologist but you're on a never-ending quest to learn about humans in all their environments. CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19) Your superpower is your humor. You're able to see things in a humorous light and that saves you time and time again. When someone seems to be going down a negative path, you're able to bring them back by saying something funny. You'd probably say that the ability to see the lighter side of life has saved you again and again. AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18) Your superpower is the ability to reinvent yourself. When you feel as if you're at the end of your rope and you don't give in to feelings of hopelessness, you start all over again. If you're not getting the respect you need from your work, you get a new job, and if your relationship has soured, you do what you can to save it. But if it's unsavable, you work on yourself. PISCES (February 19 - March 20) Your superpower is your imagination and your ability to create things from nothing. By seeing something in your mind's eye, you're able to translate it to the real world. Your ideas and creativity make you stand apart from most people. If you're in a tense situation, you can retreat to that happy place in your head and feel better.",

    "text": "There’s an ongoing recall on approximately 2,033,256 cans of coconut water sold in 29 states, according to the Food and Drug Administration. This is due to a packaging issue that poses a botulism risk.\nThe Jarritos brand coconut water was sold in 17.5-fl.-oz. cans at retailers in the following states: Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin.\nThis recall was announced after it was discovered that the seal on the lid of the cans may be compromised. This can allow bacteria like Clostridium botulinum to grow inside of the can, which can cause illness.\nAll lot codes of the coconut water are impacted by this recall. If you have the Jarritos branded product in your home, dispose of it immediately or return it to your place of purchase for a refund. Symptoms of Clostridium botulinum infection (more commonly known as botulism) can start from six hours to two weeks after consuming the bacteria. Signs of botulism may include bloating, constipation, muscle weakness, double vision, dizziness, trouble speaking or swallowing and difficulty breathing. If you are showing any of these symptoms, seek medical attention as soon as possible.\nFor questions about this recall, contact your local FDA Complaint Coordinator.",

    "title": "That's a nice Christmas bonus! Father-of-three Tesco delivery driver who scooped £3.8m lottery jackpot reveals he only realised he'd become a new millionaire the next day... and kept the good news secret for a WEEK",
    "text": "Jonny Johnston, 45, went to bed before realising the next day he had won\nA supermarket delivery driver got an early Christmas present – after scooping £3.8million on the lottery.\nJonny Johnston, 45, had just finished his rounds for Tesco when he spotted an email announcing ‘good news about your ticket’.\nAssuming he had won a lucky dip, the father of three went to bed and it was only when he checked his phone the next day that he realised he had become a millionaire overnight.\nBut the down-to-earth supermarket worker kept his news a secret for a week, even completing a click and collect shift at his local store, handing out bags of turkey and trimmings to customers in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, on Saturday, before news of his win spread.\nMr Johnston, who has never been abroad in his life, now plans to take his partner of 25 years, Christina, and their three children, aged 19, 20 and 23, on holiday together for the first time.\nJonny Johnston and his partner Christina Williams celebrate at the Culloden Estate & Spa Hotel in Belfast after winning £3.8million on the Lotto draw\nThe father went to bed and it was only when he checked his phone the next day that he realised he had become a millionaire overnight\nThe supermarket worker then kept his amazing news a secret for a week\nHe said: ‘I’m still in disbelief. This is a dream come true for me and my family. I’ve always worked hard, and this win will allow us to do things we could only ever have dreamt of before. I would love for us all to go to the Caribbean, maybe on a cruise as it sounds and looks incredible. We have never had a family holiday together. I just need to apply for my passport first.’\nMr Johnson has played the lottery with the same numbers for more than 20 years. Three weeks ago, however, he matched two numbers and won an additional Lucky Dip for the Lotto draw on Saturday December 16. It was the free Lucky Dip line, with numbers 4, 12, 23, 30, 50 and 56, which proved to be the winner.\nReferring to the moment he realised he had won, Mr Johnston said: ‘I was sitting on the edge of the bed on Sunday morning trying to make sense of what I was seeing. I just kept staring at the numbers on my account. I thought maybe I had won £38,000 but then there were too many zeros. I passed the phone to Christina for her to check and she was in disbelief too. We both began to think that it was a trick, a scam even. We decided we had better call Camelot and double-check.’\nMr Johnson has played the lottery with the same numbers for more than 20 years\nReferring to the moment he realised he had won, Mr Johnston said: ‘I was sitting on the edge of the bed on Sunday morning trying to make sense of what I was seeing’\nMr Johnston said both him and Christina were in disbelief when they first found out the news\nOnly when the National Lottery confirmed the win did the couple break the news to their children.\n‘The kids were silent at first, looking at both of us in disbelief,’ Mr Johnston added. ‘Then the screaming and shouting started, everyone was jumping around the kitchen, cheering. Seeing as it was still early, we popped the kettle on and toasted the amazing news with a cup of coffee.’\nMr Johnston said he also had his eye on a vintage car and may also buy a new tractor for one of his sons, who works on a farm.\n‘I am incredibly grateful and still trying to wrap my head around it all,’ he said.",
