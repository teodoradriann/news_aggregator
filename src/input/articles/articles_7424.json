    "text": "Independientemente que el subsecretario Eduardo Clark asegurÃ³ en diversas reuniones que no asignarÃa con base en el estudio de mercado de patentes, parece ser que en el afÃ¡n de ahorrar y comprar medicamentos a precios del 2020 -incluso 2019- sÃ lo estÃ¡ haciendo.\nDespuÃ©s del anuncio del evento en Compranet para cubrir el abasto de 2025/2026 se han registrado mÃ¡s de tres mil preguntas. El problema se desbordÃ³ y ayer mismo se suspendiÃ³ la junta de aclaraciones hasta nuevo aviso. Y para sorpresa del sector de esa publicaciÃ³n desaparecieron mÃ¡s de veinticinco claves de alto consumo, segÃºn esto por instrucciones del subsecretario Clark GarcÃa Dobarganes, quien estarÃa intentando orillar a amigos o fabricantes a surtirlas en tiempo rÃ©cord con precios que no consideran ni siquiera la inflaciÃ³n.\nA todo eso hay que sumar la presiÃ³n de la industria farmacÃ©utica, esos paladines al servicio de la salud que con engaÃ±os le han hecho creer que muchas de esas claves aÃºn cuentan con patentes, presionando al subsecretario a que les asignen a los de siempre.\nDespuÃ©s del decreto que fue publicado en el Diario Oficial, la posibilidad de importar productos de patente vencida, estÃ¡ abierta y ello podrÃa traer una competencia significativa a ese grupo de privilegiados de siempre (Amarox, Psicofarma, Buffington) por mencionar a algunos.\nLa AMELAF negocia en lo obscuro y hace pensar al subsecretario Clark que existen patentes y que no han vencido. La razÃ³n, apoderarse como siempre de las claves en el contrato central, no surtir, generar desabasto y provocar las compras emergentes a precios inflados, ese ha sido el negocio de esos laboratorios, que culpan a los distribuidores pero en realidad son ellos y sus aliados del IMSS.\nEl subsecretario deberÃa en este esfuerzo incluirlas en la compra consolidada, fomentar la libre competencia y de paso cumplir con su palabra, algo de poca valÃa en la cuarta transformaciÃ³n.\nEsta compra apresurada, con precios imposibles, con entregas de punta a punta parecen estar destinadas a un fracaso ya visto con el modelo de la ONOPS y del INSABI.\nNadie cuestiona el comprar a los mejores precios y las mejores condiciones para los derechohabientes. Pero deberÃa de haber observancia dentro de los que participan para ver si cumplen con sus evaluaciones tÃ©cnicas (cuestionadas en BIRMEX), si poseen el producto y si pueden cumplir con los tiempos de entrega.\nExisten sin nÃºmero de contratos centralizados que no tienen Ã³rdenes de reposiciÃ³n y que estÃ¡n vigentes y podrÃan medianamente abatir el desbasto del primer trimestre.\nEn Salud no hay medicina mÃ¡s cara que la que no hay; tampoco se debe de descubrir el hilo negro y debe regir las transparencias y la planeaciÃ³n adecuada.\nPor favor no corte ni pegue en la web nuestras notas, tiene la posibilidad de redistribuirlas usando nuestras herramientas.\n[reglamento de terminos y condiciones](/institucional/terminos-y-condiciones/)serÃ¡ eliminado e inhabilitado para volver a comentar.",

    "text": "Growing trend of selling used goods contributes to greener lifestyle From pre-loved clothing and handbags to furniture and books, the trade in secondhand merchandise is growing rapidly in China — delivering not only bargains, but also green benefits. The trend represents a change in Chinese people's mindset, as more consumers are recognizing the value of extending the life span of products through reuse and recycling. By embracing the secondhand market, they are not only finding cost-effective alternatives but also contributing to a more sustainable and eco-friendly way of life through the recycling of goods. Kang Lin, in her 40s, is originally from Shenzhen, Guangdong province, and now calls Hong Kong home. A seasoned traveler, she lived in Oxford, the United Kingdom, for a year and a half, Shanghai for a year, and Chiang Mai, northern Thailand, for 12 months. READ MORE: [Cellphone owners hope for more disposal options](https://www.chinadailyhk.com/hk/article/161847#Cellphone-owners-hope-for-more-disposal-options-2021-03-30) For Kang, buying secondhand goods is more than just a cost-saving measure — it's a lifestyle choice that celebrates sustainability and uncovers hidden treasures from the past. \"When I lived overseas, buying secondhand was the most cost-effective option since these items were inexpensive, and I didn't mind discarding them when I left,\" she said. \"It's also environmentally friendly, as it prevents usable items from going to waste — my unwanted items may be desired by others, and vice versa.\" In Oxford, Kang immersed herself in exploring the city's many charity shops. She even volunteered at Oxfam, the nonprofit organization combating global hunger, which operates over 500 stores in the UK, generating nearly 50 million pounds ($63 million) annually from the sale of donated secondhand goods like clothing, housewares, furniture, and more. But affordability isn't the sole reason Kang is drawn to secondhand shopping. She values \"the opportunity to uncover treasures — especially antique items that offer a glimpse into past production techniques.\" Kang has discovered \"gems\" from the 1920s to 1950s with no signs of wear, such as a 1925 thermos flask and 1950s woolen military long johns. \"There were also high-quality brass tools from decades ago and pop-art pioneers … It felt like I'd stepped into a museum,\" she said, adding the objects served as a means to travel back in time. \"The years haven't dimmed their brilliance; instead, they made them shine ever brighter,\" she said. Refresh, repeat The Deja Vu Recycle Store launched its app in 2017. In 2020, it started its secondhand clothing business and simultaneously opened a store on Anfu Road in Shanghai. In 2024, a new store opened in Hongqiao Tiandi in Shanghai. It has also developed its apparel and electronics resale business. As of July 2024, Deja Vu recycles nearly 600,000 books and approximately 300,000 clothing items on a yearly basis. Currently, it has over 8,000 brands. Their products are sold with guarantees about their authenticity, and Deja Vu promises customers compensation equivalent to three times the purchase price if the goods are found to be counterfeit. Pirated apparel is rejected or destroyed when detected, the company said. Ye Lu, a staff member of Deja Vu's marketing department, said the company is building a community of secondhand goods enthusiasts through numerous social media platforms. \"Previously, we used WeChat and Weibo, but recently we've tried new lifestyle platforms like Xiaohongshu, product reviews, and articles, to better connect with users and make them more comfortable with secondhand goods,\" Ye said. In 2020, when Deja Vu was researching the feasibility of expanding into the secondhand clothing business, over 90 percent of survey respondents said they would not wear pre-worn clothes. Now, nearly half of their new customers get to know secondhand clothing through Deja Vu, and become repeat buyers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Deja Vu established an authentication process for secondhand clothing, built a fully automated secondhand clothing sorting facility, opened a popular secondhand store on Anfu Road in Shanghai, and launched clothing sales on their app. In mid-May, Deja Vu opened a store at Hongqiao Tian Di, with an area of 1,500 square meters, selling nearly 6,000 secondhand clothing items. \"We have been witnesses to the gradual development of the secondhand market in China over the years, and it fills us with confidence about the future,\" Ye said. Trading for profit The transaction volume of China's used goods market surpassed 1 trillion yuan ($139.9 billion) in 2020, and is expected to reach 3 trillion yuan in 2025, according to a report issued by the Institute of Energy, Environment and Economy of Tsinghua University. Data from Xianyu, one of China's largest platforms for trading secondhand products, shows that the daily transaction volume on the platform has exceeded 1 billion yuan. Over the past year, about 4 million secondhand items were listed on Xianyu on a daily basis. Forty-three percent of users are from the post-1995 generation, and 22 percent are from the post-2000 generation, the data showed. In 2023, the average post-1995 user on Xianyu earned 2,700 yuan, with young people discovering the \"wealth secret\" in trading secondhand goods. The generational change is also reflected in a stronger awareness of how consumption impacts the environment. The understanding of green consumption among those born in the 1990s and 2000s is significantly higher than other age groups in China, reaching 70 percent and 79 percent respectively, according to the Green Development Report on E-commerce in China released in 2023. Wen Tianyi, a 21-year-old advertising major at a university in Beijing, spends around 1,000 to 2,000 yuan on secondhand goods every year and gets rid of around 10 items annually. \"During the first two years of university, I had little concept of spending money, so I ended up buying many useless items here and there,\" she said. \"I started paying attention to and getting rid of idle items during my freshman year, driven by the thought of wanting to get some cash back.\" The first unused item Wen sold on Xianyu was a bottle of perfume she bought online. Her initial reason for purchasing secondhand items was simply to save money. Many of the items were relatively new, having been used only a few times. However, because they were secondhand the prices were greatly discounted. \"Key differences between buying new items and secondhand ones are lower costs but higher after-sales risks (no returns, counterfeit goods, questionable conditions), and relying on mutual trust between strangers rather than a service provider-client relationship,\" Wen said. She said buying and selling secondhand merchandise had reshaped her ideas on consumption. \"Previously, items might have just been left unused, but now they can be revitalized with the incentive of earning some money, thereby supporting sustainable consumption,\" Wen said. She has even adopted a \"secondhand mentality\" for making new purchases and considers how much an item will depreciate before being resold. This hit home when she sold 10 kilograms of clothing she had paid nearly 10,000 yuan for, to a clothing recycler for just 6 yuan. A blogger on Xiaohongshu, she advocates a minimalist approach to life and is more focused on saving money and getting rid of her unused goods. \"After dealing with idle items and engaging in secondhand consumption, I have embraced the concept of minimalist living. Moving from constantly buying to decluttering and letting go, I may have found a lifestyle that truly suits me,\" she said. Sweet charity The recycling of household items, goods, clothing, and donations of food, have for a long time played a crucial role in keeping charities afloat. Jiang Shujie is the chief executive officer of Buy42, a charitable organization founded in 2010, which operates 14 charity stores in Shanghai and sells donated goods at 30 to 70 percent below market prices. She believes the secondhand goods market is an indication of a healthy developed economy. \"The popularity of secondhand purchases is also linked to economic development — as basic needs are met and material accumulation increases in developed countries, a prosperous secondhand market emerges from the surplus goods,\" she said. After running the charity for the past seven years, Jiang said she had seen customers go from doubting the safety and hygiene of previously owned items to viewing purchasing secondhand goods as a \"cool trend\". This is driven by Generation Z's pursuit of high-end goods originally priced out of their reach, which they can now afford as secondhand purchases. It also aligns with their pursuit of unique, sustainable goods at affordable prices. The prevalence of green consumption among Chinese people has helped propel the secondhand goods sector into a period of rapid development. However, due to the nature of secondhand transactions, trust issues — such as the authenticity of goods — remain core factors in determining how far the industry can go. \"Secondhand trading platforms play a crucial role in establishing trust — acting as a bond between buyers and strangers,\" Jiang said. \"A high level of trust is required for consumers to accept purchasing and using secondhand goods with potential flaws from unknown previous owners. The value of these platforms lies in facilitating trust for the secondhand market to operate.\" However, from a positive perspective, Jiang said such platforms satisfy diverse needs — from trading secondhand luxury items to connecting communities with shared interests. She believes that platforms like Buy42 provide \"low-barrier\" public welfare opportunities by recycling secondhand and unused items. Green vision As the world's second-largest consumer market and the largest online retail market, China has introduced various policies in recent years to encourage and support green consumption and promote the recycling of unused items. \"In recent years, our country has been advocating the concept of sustainable living and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) principles. Whether from the corporate level, the government level, or the public welfare sector, there has been increasing promotion of more environmentally friendly consumption attitudes, which are becoming deeply rooted in people's mindset,\" Jiang said. In July 2021, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) issued the 14th Five-Year Plan for Circular Economy Development, explicitly encouraging the development of the \"internet plus secondhand\" model, strengthening the management responsibilities of internet trading platforms, and enhancing the oversight of such trading to provide standardized and regulated services for secondhand goods transactions. ALSO READ: [Hainan takes lead in waste recycling role](https://www.chinadailyhk.com/hk/article/141920#Hainan-takes-lead-in-waste-recycling-role-2020-09-02) \"Establishing a sound recycling system for waste materials is of great significance for achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality, and the trading of idle goods is also an important measure to help achieve these 'dual carbon' goals,\" said Du Huanzheng, director of the Institute of Ecological Civilization and Circular Economy at Tongji University in Shanghai. In 2022, the NDRC and the Ministry of Commerce, along with other departments, issued the Implementation Plan for Promoting Green Consumption. The plan proposed the expansion of channels for the sharing and utilization of idle resources and secondhand transactions. \"People's mindset toward using secondhand products is gradually shifting, and the volume of secondhand transactions is increasing, corresponding to supply and demand,\" Du said. \"With more standardized trading platforms emerging in China, this signals that the secondhand market will definitely be a future lifestyle trend.\" Contact the writer at [sunnyu923@163.com](mailto:sunnyu923@163.com)",

    "text": "Filmer avec des lunettes connectées doit être consenti dans les espaces publics Les lunettes connectées Ray-Ban Stories , proposées par Meta et Ray-Ban, permettent de capturer des images et vidéos en toute discrétion. Toutefois, comme le rapporte BFMTV , la Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés (CNIL) a rappelé que leur usage est strictement encadré par le Règlement général sur la protection des données (RGPD) . Selon l'organisme, «  le principe de loyauté et de transparence impose que les personnes filmées ou photographiées soient informées du traitement de leurs données personnelles  ».Autrement dit, filmer des inconnus dans un espace public pour un usage personnel est toléré, mais si le contenu est diffusé à leur insu en ligne, vous êtes hors la loi ! En cas de publication sur les réseaux sociaux, les utilisateurs doivent obtenir un consentement explicite , une condition qui est de fait, difficilement réalisable dans le cas de lieux publics.\nLa CNIL a également précisé que ces lunettes ne sont pas assimilables aux systèmes de vidéosurveillance statique, mais qu’elles restent soumises à des analyses au cas par cas. Par exemple, un usage journalistique, dans le cadre du droit à l’information, pourrait être toléré, à condition de respecter les droits des personnes filmées. Cependant, pour tout autre usage, la responsabilité incombe directement à l’utilisateur en cas de plainte ou de violation des règles.\nDe nombreux risques de dérive Les dispositifs des Ray-Ban Stories incluent des caméras 5 mégapixels, des micros et une LED blanche censée signaler qu’un enregistrement est en cours. Mais cette diode est jugée trop discrète. Les tests effectués par des médias spécialisés ont montré que la plupart des passants ne remarquent pas qu’ils sont filmés, même dans des espaces clos comme les transports publics. Cette invisibilité alimente les craintes d’intrusion dans la vie privée ou d’utilisation détournée, comme l’espionnage.\nMeta a instauré certaines limitations techniques pour rassurer : impossibilité de diffuser des vidéos en direct ou d’éteindre la LED pendant l’enregistrement. Néanmoins, les inquiétudes persistent. Selon les experts, ces dispositifs manquent de transparence et pourraient être facilement utilisés pour des enregistrements illégaux.",

    "text": "Meteorología\nEl temporal se salda con decenas de carreteras cortadas por la crecida de cauces y ramblas en la Región\nEl desbordamiento de algunos tramos de los ríos Mula, Quípar y Argos lleva a la Comunidad Autónoma a activar el plan Inunmur en fase de preemergencia\nEl peor día del temporal de lluvias en la Región de Murcia se dejó notar con fuerza, pero se mantuvo alejado de las previsiones más pesimistas de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet). Sólo el pluviómetro de Pinar Hermoso, en Mula, superó los 80 litros acumulados en 12 horas previstos de manera generalizada en el aviso amarillo. En concreto, se llegaron a recoger 88,6 litros entre las 8.00 y las 20.00 horas y más de 100 en las últimas 24 horas. Le siguieron de cerca los pluviómetros de Pliego (53,8 en 12 horas) o el de Cartagena (44,4), donde se vivieron la mayores trombas de agua. En Murcia, el episodio de lluvias se cebó especialmente con Algezares, donde se llegaron a acumular 41 litros por metro cuadrado en las últimas 24 horas.\nLa comarca del Río Mula, junto con Bullas, Murcia y Cartagena y el Valle del Guadalentín, fueron algunas de las zonas más castigadas por las precipitaciones, que se mantuvieron constantes, aunque con pequeñas treguas.\nEsta situación llevó al Centro de Coordinación de Emergencias 112 a activar el plan Inunmur en fase de preemergencia, como consecuencia del desbordamiento de algunos tramos del cauce de los ríos Mula, Quípar y Argos.\nLas fuertes lluvias y las crecidas de los ríos Mula y Pliego, así como de ramblas y cauces, provocaron a lo largo de la jornada multitud de cortes de carreteras y retenciones en la circulación por toda la Región, sobre todo en Murcia, Mazarrón, Bullas y Mula.\nLas incidencias más relevantes fueron los cortes del tráfico en caminos y vías próximas al río Mula, y las restricciones en la circulación en la rambla del Garruchal (Beniaján, Murcia) y en Cehegín, donde se cortó el paso del río Argos por el Campillo a la Pila.\nCabe destacar que, a pesar de las advertencias y la recomendación de buscar rutas alternativas, muchos conductores hicieron caso omiso a las indicaciones de la Policía Local y atravesaron con sus vehículos la zona restringida en la rambla del Garruchal.\nEn Mazarrón, los agentes de la Policía Local tuvieron que intervenir por el arrastre de un vehículo en una zona de paso de la rambla, en el camino que va de Cañada de Gallego a Puntas de Calnegre. Por fortuna, no hubo que lamentar ningún daño personal, ya que el vehículo no transportaba a ningún ocupante.\nAdemás de la lluvia, los fuertes vientos también generaron algunos incidentes. La caída de un pino en la antigua N-301, a la altura de la Venta antes de llegar a la diputación cartagenera de El Albujón, interrumpió durante varios minutos la circulación.\nEn la RM-503 (Bullas-Aledo), se produjo un desprendimiento de rocas. Las brigadas enviadas por la Consejería de Fomento procedieron a la retirada de los obstáculos y pudo restablecerse con rapidez la circulación.\nY en La Aljorra, algunos vecinos denuncian que llevan aislados desde el domingo por las lluvias, que han llenado de barro el camino de tierra por el que acceden a sus viviendas, una vía de unos 300 metros que sale de la carretera general.\nEl asfalto mojado también provocó retenciones importantes en la autovía A30 y algunos accidentes de consideración, como el que se produjo en la carretera N-344 entre Yecla y Jumilla. Según informaron desde el Parque de Bomberos de Yecla, no hubo que lamentar heridos de gravedad.\nRRSS WhatsApp\nRRSS Facebook\nRRSS Twitter\nRRSS email\nCopiar URL)\nNoticia guardada en tu perfil",

    "text": "Die Stromtrasse Südostlink soll massenhaft Energie aus dem Norden bis nach Bayern bringen. Eine Stadt in Oberfranken sieht bei sich die Trinkwasserversorgung beeinträchtigt und klagt.\nDie oberfränkische Stadt Marktredwitz versucht mit einer Klage, die geplante Stromtrasse Südostlink auf ihrem Gebiet zu verhindern. Die Kreisstadt befürchtet durch den Trassenbau Beeinträchtigungen der Trinkwasserversorgung.\nDie Klage der Stadt beim Bundesverwaltungsgericht in Leipzig richtet sich konkret gegen den Planfeststellungsbeschluss der Bundesnetzagentur für den Abschnitt der Trasse von Marktredwitz (Landkreis Wunsiedel) nach Pfreimd (Landkreis Schwandorf).\nKeine aufschiebende Wirkung\nDer Stromnetzbetreiber Tennet verantwortet den Bau der neuen Trasse. Eine aufschiebende Wirkung hat die Klage nach Angaben eines Sprechers nicht. Auf die Einwände der Kommune ging der Sprecher auf Anfrage nicht konkret ein und verwies darauf, dass sich die Klage zunächst an die Bundesnetzagentur als Genehmigungsbehörde richte.\nÜber die Stromtrasse Südostlink soll ab 2027 grüner Strom von Klein Rogahn nahe Schwerin in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern über Wolmirstedt in Sachsen-Anhalt bis zu einem Netzverknüpfungspunkt bei Landshut transportiert werden. Der bayerische Abschnitt - der rein als Erdkabel verlaufenden Trasse - ist rund 270 Kilometer lang. Anfang November 2024 hatte Tennet im Landkreis Hof begonnen, die ersten Kabel zu verlegen.\nKlagen und Eilanträge bislang ohne Erfolg\nEs ist nicht die erste Klage gegen das Projekt: Zuletzt war die oberfränkische Gemeinde Trogen mit einer Klage und einem Eilantrag gegen die Genehmigung des Abschnitts der Trasse von Münchenreuth im Landkreis Hof nach Marktredwitz im Landkreis Wunsiedel gescheitert. Das Bundesverwaltungsgericht wies beide Verfahren Mitte März ab.\nIn Summe gab es laut einer Gerichtssprecherin bislang bereits sieben Klagen und vier dazugehörige Eilanträge, die sich gegen die geplante Südostlink-Trasse richten. Zu vier Klagen und einem Eilantrag steht eine Entscheidung derzeit noch aus.\n© dpa-infocom, dpa:250508-930-514554/1",

    "text": "Ben Carson sugiere que las \"batallas culturales ilógicas\" indican una guerra espiritual\nEl Dr. Ben Carson sugirió durante un\npodcast que la naturaleza cada vez más irracional de las batallas políticas y culturales de Estados Unidos sugiere que fuerzas sobrenaturales están desempeñando un papel en ellas.\nCreo que hay fuerzas en acción, fuerzas para el bien y fuerzas para el mal”, dijo Carson durante una entrevista en “Cultura y Cristianismo: El Podcast de Allen Jackson” que abordó su libro de 2024\nThe Perilous Fight: Overcoming Our Culture’s War on the American Family.\nEstamos en WhatsApp.\n[Empieza a seguirnos ahora]\n“Tenemos cosas completamente ilógicas ocurriendo mientras algunas fuerzas intentan adoctrinar a nuestros hijos y quitarles cualquier sentido de patriotismo; tomar niños pequeños que son sugestionables y confundirlos sobre su género, sobre si realmente hay alguna diferencia entre hombres y mujeres, que está bien que los hombres jueguen en deportes femeninos y estén en sus vestuarios”, dijo Carson.\n“Solo cosas locas como esa”, continuó, para luego afirmar que tales tácticas están socavando efectivamente los cimientos de la sociedad.\n“Sumen eso a la guerra cultural contra la familia nuclear tradicional, de la que se burlan, y al hecho de que como sociedad hemos denigrado todo el proceso del matrimonio. La gente ya no se casa. Se casan tarde, no tienen hijos; todos los pilares fundamentales de una sociedad fuerte, y vemos las consecuencias de esas cosas”.\nCuando\nAllen Jackson, el presentador del podcast y pastor principal de la iglesia World Outreach Church, le preguntó si tales tendencias podrían revertirse, Carson expresó escepticismo, señalando su creencia de que la Biblia predice que la humanidad se volverá cada vez más corrupta antes del regreso de Cristo.\nPero Carson también dijo que Dios llama a los cristianos a ser fieles pase lo que pase.\n“Reconozcan que la Biblia dice que en los últimos tiempos, esto es lo que va a suceder”, dijo Carson en una aparente referencia a la advertencia en\n2 de Pedro 3. “Eso no significa que no debamos luchar contra ello; no significa que no debamos hacer todo lo que podamos para ayudar a la gente a ver la luz y salvar a tantas personas como sea posible”.\nHaciendo referencia a la historia bíblica de Sadrac, Mesac y Abednego en\nDaniel 3, Carson señaló cómo los tres hombres estaban dispuestos a confiar en Dios y obedecer, incluso si Él no los salvaba del horno de fuego.\n“No se inclinarían ante la imagen de oro, y como resultado, serían arrojados al horno de fuego, y le dijeron al rey: ‘Nuestro Dios puede salvarnos, pero incluso si no lo hace, seguiremos sirviéndole a Él y no a ti’”.\n“Y eso indicaba el nivel de fe que tenían: que incluso si Él no los salvaba, Él conocía el principio y el fin, Él sabía lo que era mejor y ellos tenían completa confianza y fe en Él. Eso es lo que vamos a tener que tener”.\n“En estos últimos días, las cosas se van a poner un poco complicadas”, añadió.\nLa entrevista de Carson con Jackson hizo eco de\nuna que hizo el año pasado con The Christian Post, durante la cual advirtió que Estados Unidos se está desmoronando desde adentro por la destrucción de la familia.\n“¿Cuál es el fundamento de nuestras fortalezas? Son nuestras familias, y no podemos ser derribados militarmente, pero podemos ser destruidos desde adentro, y eso es exactamente lo que le está pasando a nuestra sociedad. Quiero que la gente vea lo que está pasando”, le dijo a CP en ese momento.\nCarson pasó la mayor parte de su carrera como un prominente neurocirujano antes de servir como secretario de Vivienda y Desarrollo Urbano bajo el presidente Donald Trump durante su primer mandato.",
