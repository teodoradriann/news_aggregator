    "text": "As part of the Republican Party’s campaign to protect Americans through a secure border with Mexico, they are pushing for a ban that would prevent the feds from removing razor wire the state of Texas has installed to protect its citizens. [Areport from Fox News](%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.foxnews.com/politics/republican-lawmakers-push-ban-feds-removing-border-barriers-supreme-court-defeat%E2%80%9D) explains the plan is from rep. Mike Collins, R-Ga. Advertisement - story continues below His legislation would ban federal authorities from removing razor wire or other barriers from the U.S.-Mexico border. That follows a narrow ruling from the Supreme Court that said federal agents could, in fact, endanger Texans by taking down the security barrier. TRENDING: [Karine Jean-Pierre dodges question about Biden having 'no idea' who's entering at border](https://www.wnd.com/2024/01/karine-jean-pierre-dodges-question-biden-no-idea-entering-border/) [Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!](https://www.wnd.com/newsletter-subscription/) Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has been in a pitched battle with Joe Biden and has dispatched the state National Guard to protect state citizens from the invasion that Biden has allowed to come across the border. Advertisement - story continues below ”President Biden is aiding and abetting illegal aliens who are swarming our border and raiding our country’s resources,” Collins explained. “Why else would he try to stop the state of Texas from turning them back to Mexico?” The proposed Restricting Administration Zealots from Obliging Raiders, or \"RAZOR,\" Act specifically prevents federal authorities like Customs and Border Protection from removing barriers erected by any state. Biden has demanded that federal agents cut the barriers state officials have put in place to protect the state’s citizens. Following the Supreme Court decision, Abbott also pointed out that Biden had failed to uphold the nation's compact with Texas “by allowing an invasion of millions of illegal immigrants under the Biden administration. Abbott charged, “The Executive Branch of the United States has a constitutional duty to enforce federal laws protecting states, including immigration laws on the books right now. President Biden has refused to enforce those laws and has even violated them.” Advertisement - story continues below IMPORTANT NOTE TO WND READERS: For America's ruling elites, nothing is more precious, wonderful and life-giving to their great cause than the Jan. 6, 2021 \"insurrection\" at the U.S. Capitol. It's irrelevant that the events didn't come remotely close to constituting an actual \"insurrection,\" or that both police and over 200 undercover FBI assets provoked the riot – which Tucker Carlson calls a \"set-up.\" Yet Vice President Kamala Harris still insists the minor riot was just as horrific as the 9/11 terror attacks and Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. WHY are the elites doing this? It's not just because convicting, imprisoning, torturing and destroying the lives of hundreds of Trump supporters is meant to terrify and intimidate millions of Americans into submission. And it's not just because activist judges and bureaucrats in over 30 states are absurdly trying to keep Trump off their state's election ballots by citing the 14th Amendment's prohibition against anyone who \"engaged in insurrection\" from holding elective office. Advertisement - story continues below It's because the elites' destruction of America is so rapid, horrendous and obvious that they feel compelled to turn their opponents into monsters – or lose power at the next election. But that doesn't mean just calling conservatives and Christians \"racists,\" \"white supremacists,\" \"radical extremists\" and \"domestic terrorists\" as they do continually. They know much more is needed. Question: What if, far from being horrified by a half-baked riot they absurdly claim is worse than any domestic disturbance since the Civil War, the left actually LOVES the idea of violence on the right – the worse the better – since it perfectly serves their agenda? Increasingly, all the evidence strongly suggests today's power-mad leftist elites not only intend to intimidate and discredit their political opponents by calling them terrorists, they mean to provoke actual violence. The secret strategies and shocking tactics of today's ascendant far-left elites are exposed as perhaps never before in the January issue of WND's critically acclaimed monthly Whistleblower magazine, headlined [\"INCITING VIOLENCE: DEMS' SECRET STRATEGY FOR STAYING IN POWER.\"](https://superstore.wnd.com/whistleblower/) WHISTLEBLOWER is available in [both the popular print edition and a state-of-the-art digital version, either single issues or discounted annual subscriptions.](https://superstore.wnd.com/whistleblower/) Advertisement - story continues below For 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

    "text": "Beta Program intends to offer early access to software in development. Smartphone vendors usually conduct Beta testing activity of their new software skins. The purpose is to test the upcoming changes while they are under development voluntarily. Unsurprisingly, Beta builds have some functional issues and problems and Samsung One UI 7 is also rumored to have a buggy start.\nAccording to IceUniverse , One UI 7 Beta may be buggy at the start. It’s not a concerning case as Beta firmware is only for testing purposes. Galaxy users don’t need to worry about it as Samsung already scheduled a public rollout in early 2025.\nThe tipster notes that the latest One UI 7 Beta build is ZXKB. It has bugs in animation that seemingly appeared in the final testing phase. Notably, the Beta Program hasn’t yet officially kicked off for any Samsung device.\nOne UI 7 Beta may not be launched smoothly, and there are too many bugs. Even in the latest version of XKB, there are still bugs in animation, and they are new bugs.\nThere are too many things that Samsung has fallen behind in recent years. It is very difficult for them to make up…\n— ICE UNIVERSE (@UniverseIce) November 15, 2024\nOne UI 6 Beta had many issues related to animation and system fluency. The company took about two months to address severe problems. This time, things won’t be that bad as rigorous testing is already underway at Samsung labs.\nIt’s mid-November and Galaxy S25 series debut is rumored for late January. It’s officially confirmed that Samsung will introduce the One UI 7 during the Galaxy Unpacked. Later on, Galaxy consumers will start receiving the update.\nOne UI 7 – Peak customization Samsung’s Android 15 update could bring heavy customization abilities. The sections of the Quick Settings panel could be positioned as per user convenience. The brightness slider and volume bar section’s position can be changed.\nGood Lock will also be upgraded with improved modules and plugins. Home Up is rumored to come with an animation tuning feature . Galaxy users can apply iOS and stock Android-inspired animations through Good Lock.",

    "text": "Luego de cerca de 22 años de ahorro con la recolección de tapas plásticas, la Fundación Sanar logró ayer uno de sus principales hitos. Durante este jueves 14 de marzo, con un sentido acto, se inauguró la Casa Terapéutica Sanar, ubicada en la carrera 32A con calle 18 del barrio San Alonso de Bucaramanga. En este lugar se atenderán niños, niñas y adolescentes con cáncer y además se les brindará apoyo a sus familias. “Estamos trabajando dos líneas muy importantes en el centro terapéutico. Por un lado, están las charlas de síntomas y alarmas del cáncer infantil para toda la comunidad, en donde les damos luces sobre la detección temprana”, afirmó la presidenta de la junta directiva de la Fundación Sanar, seccional Bucaramanga, Ximena Herrera. Lea también: Cacique aporta 330 mil tapitas para los niños de la Fundación Sanar en Bucaramanga La segunda línea que se trabajará es la de psicoterapia. La casa cuenta con varios consultorios, en donde los niños recibirán atención especializada con psicólogos a través de lúdica, juegos y otras estrategias. En otro de los espacios de la vivienda, los menores enfermos tendrán acceso a tratamientos de fisioterapia, en caso de requerir rehabilitación durante o tras su tratamiento. Asimismo, los niños y sus familias se podrán integrar en un espacio de zonas húmedas en las que se les brindará servicio de hidroterapia.

Esto se complementa con los auxilios de transporte para quienes más los necesiten. Si usted quiere seguir apoyando esta noble causa, lo único que tiene que hacer es recolectar tapas de los envases plásticos de productos como aceite, suavizante, bebidas azucaradas, cremas dentales, agua mineral y otros elementos que las contengan. El día de la ‘tapatón’ puede acercarse y dejarlas en la Casa Sanar o en los puntos autorizados en varios centros comerciales del área metropolitana de Bucaramanga. Toda la cantidad de plástico que se reúne se vende a empresas que elaboran artículos de pasta. Ellos adelantan un proceso de triturado y lo convierten en nuevas piezas que se usan, por ejemplo, para motocicletas. Con el dinero recaudado se financian consultas, medicamentos y exámenes, además de subsidios para citas de psicología, mercados, transporte y refrigerios para los pequeños. “Tenemos nuestros contenedores. Nos pueden reconocer por nuestro logo de la carita feliz, donde también aparece nuestro nombre y los números de teléfono por si necesitan que hagamos las recolecciones. Recuerden que también estamos en edificios, entidades y en establecimientos de comercio”, precisó la doctora Ximena Herrera.

    "text": "January 5, 2024\nBy Louis DiPietro\nTools we don’t trust are tools we don’t use. For generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, this means it is critical to measure trust when evaluating tools that require user-inputted data.\nThis semester, a student team from the\nMaster of Professional Studies (MPS) program in the Department of Information Science led a research project alongside Google to develop metrics to measure user-perceived trustworthiness in burgeoning GenAI tools like ChatGPT and Google Bard. The team then homed in on the most important factors contributing to trustworthiness.\nThe project was one of 10 in this semester’s\nMPS Project Practicum (INFO 5900), the program’s linchpin, project-based course where students build implementable solutions to real-world problems for clients – from Fortune 500 companies and startups to nonprofits and government agencies.\nThrough a survey of roughly 110 student developers and full-time Google employees, the student team found that respondents mostly use GenAI tools for idea generation and that privacy and accuracy are the most important factors when evaluating GenAI trustworthiness. Users want to be assured the information they plug into these tools is kept confidential, and they want that information to be correct, according to the team’s findings.\n“The class provided us with practical experience in developing and implementing solutions for real-world problems,” said Zhuoer Lyu, an MPS student and member of the research team. “We felt fortunate to collaborate with industry partners like Google to enhance our understanding of GenAI applications.”\nAmong its recommendations to Google, the student team said users of GenAI tools should be given control over their data by providing clear options for opting in or out of data collection, personalized experiences, and sharing of their information. In regard to accuracy, the team recommended allowing users to verify the AI’s answers. In turn, this feedback would help hone the AI models.\nThe student team consisted of Lyu, Jingruo Chen, Elisabeth Kam, Tung-Yen Wang, Xiaohan Wang, and Yahui Zhang.\nElsewhere, a separate team of MPS students carried out a combination UX design and UX research project for Google Cloud to examine how AI could better integrate tools to build and maintain customer relationships. MPS students Jinmo Huang, Haochen Hu, and Miles Ma worked on the UX design side, while Bandar Qadan, Pika Cai, and Jai Chandnani worked on the UX research.\n\"This semester's projects were complex and provided a healthy combination of meaningful practical experience coupled with intellectual expansion,” said\nSharlane Cleare, lecturer of information science in the Cornell Ann S.

    "text": "As quatro derrotas consecutivas nos últimos quatro jogos de 2024 atiraram o Manchester United para um fosso de onde parecia ser difícil sair. Ruben Amorim foi criticado, os jogadores foram criticados, a estrutura foi criticada — e era cada vez mais difícil não aceitar a ideia de que o treinador português iria ser apenas mais um a desaparecer na enorme máquina trituradora que se tornou o clube inglês. 2025, porém, trouxe esperança.\nAquilo que se adivinhava como uma possível hecatombe, na visita a Anfield, tornou-se num empate simpático contra o Liverpool. E aquilo que se adivinhava uma provável eliminação, na visita ao Emirates, tornou-se numa vitória contra o Arsenal que garantiu o apuramento para a quarta ronda da Taça de Inglaterra. Em poucos dias, o Manchester United parecia ter reencontrado novamente o rumo que chegou a aparecer quando Ruben Amorim substituiu Erik ten Hag. Mas o próprio Ruben Amorim tinha plena noção de que tudo poderia voltar a mudar.\nAmorim não parou no vermelho e saiu-lhe a sorte: Man. United elimina Arsenal nos penáltis depois de Dalot ter sido expulso\nPUB • CONTINUE A LER A SEGUIR\n“Estou sempre preocupado. Estar preocupado é o meu trabalho. Mas temos de enfrentar o Southampton da mesma maneira que enfrentámos o Liverpool e o Arsenal, é esse o objetivo. Nem mais, nem menos, é encarar o jogo. Perceber que todos os jogos são difíceis, mas que as pessoas estão à espera de uma vitória. Isso muda as coisas. Ter pressão para ganhar é o tipo de pressão que queremos ter. Contra o Arsenal e o Liverpool ninguém estava à espera de que conseguíssemos ganhar, mas precisamos de estar preparados para essa pressão. Precisamos dessa pressão, enquanto equipa, e temos de abordar o jogo da maneira certa”, disse o treinador português na antevisão do jogo desta quinta-feira contra o Southampton.\nAssim, no primeiro jogo em Old Trafford desde o início do ano, Ruben Amorim fazia duas alterações ao onze inicial que enfrentou o Arsenal — e ambas forçadas, com Diogo Dalot castigado depois de ter sido expulso na Taça e Harry Maguire a ser suplente depois de ter estado em dúvida até ao apito inicial, com Leny Yoro a assumir o lugar do inglês do trio de centrais e Amad Diallo a entrar para o lugar do português. Do outro lado, num Southampton que está afundado no último lugar da Premier League e que soma uma única vitória na temporada, o destaque ia para a titularidade de Mateus Fernandes, médio português que chegou a ser treinado por Amorim no Sporting.\nSaints in our sights ???? #MUFC || #MUNSOU pic.twitter.com/XZ0kWWcRb2\n— Manchester United (@ManUtd) January 16, 2025\nO jogo começou dividido e equilibrado, ainda que fosse possível perceber que o Manchester United tinha muitas dificuldades para conectar setores e chegar com perigo perto da baliza de Aaron Ramsdale. A primeira oportunidade pertenceu mesmo ao Southampton, com Sulemana a deixar Leny Yoro e André Onana a evitar o golo com uma grande defesa (12′), e a verdade é que o momento foi apenas uma amostra daquilo que seria toda a primeira parte.\nA equipa de Ivan Jurić foi sempre mais perigosa do que a de Ruben Amorim e Onana voltou a ser decisivo quando, já depois de parar um remate de Mateus Fernandes (15′), fez duas defesas no mesmo lance a um pontapé de Tyler Dibling e à recarga do médio português (28′). Pelo meio, Alejandro Garnacho teve a melhor situação dos red devils ao desviar ao lado, já na área, na sequência de uma boa assistência de Højlund (41′).\nO Manchester United só fez o primeiro remate enquadrado já depois da meia-hora, com Bruno Fernandes a atirar para uma defesa simples de Ramsdale (35′), e o Southampton acabou mesmo por chegar ao golo ainda antes do intervalo. Canto cobrado na esquerda e Manuel Ugarte, ao primeiro poste, acabou por desviar para a própria baliza para fazer autogolo (43′) — no fim da primeira parte, a equipa de Ruben Amorim estava a perder em casa.\nManchester sofre novamente de canto ???? #DAZNPremier pic.twitter.com/JwoKBt1XjT\n— DAZN Portugal (@DAZNPortugal) January 16, 2025\nO treinador português mexeu no início da segunda parte e trocou Kobbie Mainoo por Antony, que teve uma oportunidade logo nos primeiros instantes que passou em campo. Mas o marcador continuava sem mudar e Ruben Amorim fez mais duas substituições ainda antes de estarem cumpridos dez minutos do segundo tempo, lançando Joshua Zirkzee e Toby Collyer. O Manchester United poderia ter empatado por volta da hora de jogo, com Antony a desperdiçar uma ocasião flagrante quando só precisava de encostar (59′), e as bancadas de Old Trafford começavam a desesperar.\nQuando tudo já parecia encaminhar-se para o lado negro, porém, apareceu o jóquer do costume. Amad Diallo recebeu na direita, foi feliz num ressalto e ficou na cara de Ramsdale para atirar rasteiro e empatar o jogo (82′). Sete minutos depois, Amad Diallo combinou com Eriksen e de primeira, novamente só com o guarda-redes pela frente, desviou de primeira para carimbar a reviravolta (90′). Já nos descontos, Amad Diallo aproveitou o desnorte da defesa adversária e assinou o hat-trick (90+4′).\nO Manchester United venceu o Southampton em Old Trafford com direito a reviravolta e hat-trick e voltou às vitórias na Premier League um mês depois, carimbando o segundo triunfo consecutivo depois de eliminar o Arsenal na Taça de Inglaterra e subindo ao 12.º lugar da classificação.\nSobre aproveitar ressaltos ????
