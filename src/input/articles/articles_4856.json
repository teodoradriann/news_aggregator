(Photo by Christophe ARCHAMBAULT / AFP) Nigeria’s return to women’s football at the Olympics for the first time in 16 years got off to a bad start, yesterday, in Bordeaux, where the Super Falcons lost 0-1 to Brazil in the opening game of Group C.\nNigerians were expecting the Super Falcons to build on their impressive performance at the 2023 World Cup in Australia/New Zealand, where they came within a penalty shoot-out to the quarterfinals, but they were hemmed back by a Brazilian side relying so much on Marta’s artistry to dictate the game.\nThe match was on an even flow in the first half until the 37th minute when Marta seized the ball and sent a sweet pass to Gabriel da Silva, who unleashed a ferocious strike beyond the flailing hands of Chiamaka Nnadozie.\nThereafter, the Samba Girls took over the pitch, running at the Nigerians at will.\nPerhaps, the outcome would have been different had Chinwendu Ihezuo made good use of Nigeria’s best chance of the game early in the half.\nNigeria had three big chances in quick succession, one of which was led by Rasheedat Ajibade, Nigeria’s best player, beating her marker before crossing for Ihezuo, whose header was saved by Brazil’s goalkeeper.\nThe second half belonged to the Brazilians, whose fluid movement and precise passes confounded the Super Falcons.\nBut the Super Falcons did not go down without a fight as they took matters into their hands towards the end of the game. But their best efforts could not yield the desired equalizer.\nThis defeat means that Randy Waldrum’s side must win one of their two games against world champions, Spain and Japan, and also get a draw in one to stand a chance of making the second round as one of the best third-placed teams after the first round of games.",

    "text": "Tucson has many programs and sources available to technology startups to provide resources and a better chance of success.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, around 600,000 small businesses were started in the U.S. each year since 2015. Out of these businesses, 53.6% will fail before they hit their five-year mark, and 75.3% won’t make it past 15 years in business.\nThe Arizona Commerce Authority reports that 214,669 businesses were established in Arizona during 2023.\nTucson is a community focused on startups, small business and new businesses. In 2023, the Downtown Tucson Partnership reported that 29 businesses were started in downtown Tucson with 14 opening soon.\nThere are many reasons that businesses may fail, but one of the top failing industries is technology startups. Technology has produced some of the most profitable businesses, but according to the U.S. Census Bureau, 14.9% of tech-related businesses will fail.\nPeople are also reading…\nScaling up startups\nThe University of Arizona Center for Innovation focuses on technology startups. Its incubator program gives tech companies a higher chance of survival.\nAccording to the UACI, over 1,000 entrepreneurs were empowered through workshops, educational training and pitch preparations.\nAccording to Carol A. Stewart, vice president of the UACI, they have “between 70 to 80 startups in our program at any given time, which is an incredible number and the highest density of startups in any program in the state.”\nWhen entrepreneurs are admitted to the program they follow a “rigid 27-step,” program that is designed to help them “scale up” their science or tech business. “The program we have really dives deep into how you build a scale up science or tech company,” Stewart said.\nUACI allows startups to enter and exit the program at the most efficient times for the business.\n“Over 50% of them are life science or bio which means they need very specialized infrastructure to move their companies forward,” Stewart said. The program helps startups make connections and get the equipment they need.\nUACI has supported 235 startups, and they have helped 81 start since 2018. They help to fuel and grow science and tech startups that otherwise may not be able to succeed. Courtney Williams is an entrepreneur in Tucson, and her startup, Emagine Solutions Technology, created an app, The Journey Pregnancy.\n“We are tackling the maternal health care crisis,” Williams said. The app allows pregnant women to log their blood pressure, weight, blood glucose, mood and other pregnancy symptoms.\nThe app connects with women’s health care providers so any complications can be caught before they become fatal.\nWhen starting a business, Williams was on a journey of her own. “Initially I didn’t know what was available, and I was kinda shooting in the dark,” Williams said. “I found the University of Arizona Center for Innovation and they help usher the growth and creation process for startups, so they’ve been helpful.”\n“There are never enough resources to get your business going, more than programs it has been people that have been the most helpful,” Williams said. “There are a lot of talented entrepreneurs in our community who have had a lot of great success and they are willing to lend their experience and their time.”\nSeek advice, work hard\nJeremy Wolf, located in Tucson, started MindReady, a coaching platform for athletes. “It helps athletes get sports psychology, coaching, performance coaching and education,” Wolf said.\nWolf played professional baseball, and he realized that he couldn’t find a structured resource for coaching and education, so he decided to start his own program.\nHe started a nonprofit organization for athletes, More Than Baseball, which led him to create MindReady.\n“I knew that the model worked and I was looking at other models that were out there,” Wolf said. “I saw these models that are really successful so I knew we could take them and make them work specifically for athletes.”\nWolf was able to build a successful platform that has since taken off. “We built a marketplace of coaches so athletes can come onto our platform, go into the portal and they can match with a coach,” he said. “They can start working with them within 24 hours.”\n“I cut my teeth in building with nonprofits and when you do that you can test things, so I practiced for four years building something from scratch,” Wolf said. “In the four years of building More Than Baseball, we raised like $2.5 million and supported over 5,000 minor leaguers and now it’s the largest union in professional sports.”\n“The way that I learned how to do this or how to build this is you just do it, you just build it, you test it and you ask people for advice,” Wolf said.\nWolf has found startup sources in Tucson helpful, but for him it boils down to hard work.\n“I’m part of UACI and FORGE and those are great organizations because you get to go out and you get to pitch your idea and you get to talk about it and you get to refine it,” Wolf said. “Every single entrepreneur you talk to, it’s not about the advice or the mentors they had, it’s about the grit and the work they do every single day to make something.”\nConnecting community and entrepreneurs\nCommunityShare is a volunteer program in Pima County that started 10 years ago as a nonprofit organization. According to program coordinator Brandon Mejia, they are “bridging business and education.”\nThe platform was recently purchased by the Pima County School Superintendent’s Office so all schools in the district have access to the resources.\nCommunityShare serves as a platform for small businesses and skilled professionals to volunteer their skills so teachers in the community can connect and bring them into their K-12 classrooms to teach hands-on skills.\n“The idea behind it is building a human resource library,” Mejia said. “It gives local and small businesses the opportunity to engage with education.”\n“All these businesses are created from entrepreneurs,” Mejia said. “When they’re well established and comfortable this creates a way for them to reach out and give to education so students can learn and see that entrepreneurial mentality around business.”\nCommunityShare includes artists, authors, machine shops, musicians and other community members who share their business and talent with school districts in the community.\n“It’s all about creating opportunities for students who may not have seen that or had those opportunities so they can later down the road,” Mejia said.\nCommunityShare is creating opportunities for children who would never have these experiences. “Once we engage a community partner with an educator and get them into the classroom, or even better have them take the students out of the classroom, a lot of the time the reward they take away is being able to see those kids actively engaged in something,” Mejia said.\n“This is an idea that maybe they’re not going to learn this in school so much,” Mejia said. “But thankfully we had a community partner who came in and showed us that this applies to the real world.”\nEl Inde Arizona is a news service of the University of Arizona School of Journalism.",

    "text": "Entre 20 i 3l l/m2 en 30 minuts Alerta per noves pluges torrencials a les Terres de l'Ebre fins diumenge La subdirectora general de Protecció Civil demana prudència i diu que, sobretot, els preocupen les torreres i barrancs i un augment puntual de cabal Blanca Blay (ACN) [Protecció Civil](/tags/proteccio-civil/) ha enviat una nova alerta mòbil als veïns de les Terres de l'Ebre perquè extremin precaucions davant de l'episodi de pluges \"continuades i torrencials\" previstes fins diumenge. L'alerta recorda que cal extremar les precaucions, evitar desplaçaments innecessaris i allunyar-se de rieres i torrents. En declaracions a l'ACN, la subdirectora general de Protecció Civil, Imma Solé, demana \"molta precaució\" durant avui i el cap de setmana i subratlla que la situació de la dana encara s'espera fins diumenge. Especialment, demanen evitar desplaçaments innecessaris a les comarques del sud, on es preveuen pluges continuades i acumulació d'aigua, però també pot haver-hi pluges torrencials que deixin entre 20 i 40 litres en 30 minuts. \"Sobretot ens preocupen torrenteres i barrancs de la meitat sud del territori, dels Ports fins al Tarragonès\", indica, ja que pot ser que torrents, rieres o barrancs tinguin un augment puntual de cabal. Per això, recomanen també allunyar-se de rius, rieres o barrancs i tenir especial precaució en zones inundables. A més, subratlla que cal ser vigilants també en zones on no plou perquè pot ser que en algun punt hi hagi baixades de corrents de rius o rieres que puguin ser \"sobtadament grans\". \"Pot ser que estiguis en un punt on no plogui, que no estigui caient una gota d'aigua, però les rieres dels barrancs baixin plens\", relata. Prudència al litoral i prelitoral Amb tot, també avisa que cal ser prudents per les pluges també al litoral i prelitoral, no només al sud. \"Avui i demà sembla que estiguin més acumulades a la meitat sud, però diumenge pot ser que s'estenguin més fins a l'Empordà\", afirma.

    "title": "Horóscopo de 17 abril Profesor Salomón: Este es el único signo que tendrá suerte en el amor",
    "text": "Hoy 17 de abril, el Profesor Salomón da predicciones, recomendaciones y más a los diferentes signos zodiacales; además, señala que el color del día es el rojo y el número el 2358. Como recomendación, es importante que compren flores naturales de cualquier tipo o color y armen un florero en sus puestos de trabajo, negocio u hogar. Asimismo, el decreto del día es: “Que todo lo mejor y lo perfecto, llegue a mi vida”. Horóscopo, 17 de abril, ¿qué le deparan a los signos? 1. Aries (21 de marzo al 19 de abril) Les llegará una gran cantidad de dinero o próximamente les van a proponer una inversión que contará con buenos resultados. También, se reconciliarán con alguien con quien estaban disgustados y será lo mejor porque guardar odios y rencores no es para nada bueno. Como recomendación, el Profesor Salomón sugiere que deben revisarse la vista porque podrían presentar algún problema. El número para los Aries hoy es 9270 2. Tauro (20 de abril al 20 de mayo) Es importante conservar la calma para alcanzar lo que realmente quieren porque, en algunas ocasiones, tienden a impacientarse; por lo tanto, lo mejor que pueden hacer es esperar, ya que todo tiene su hora y lugar. Por su parte, las personas nacidas bajo este signo que se encuentren en un tratamiento médico o que van a tener próximamente una cirugía, no deben preocuparse, pues todo saldrá demasiado bien. Asimismo, el tarotista señala que van a recibir ese dinero que tanto esperaban y les ayudará a salir adelante e incluso mejorar su situación económica. El número para Tauro es 3870 3. Géminis (21 de mayo al 20 de junio) Los Géminis están en un muy buen momento de sus vidas porque muchos proyectos que tienen en marcha se van a ir concretando de a pocos; asimismo, esto no solo mejorará su vida, sino que les dará la estabilidad que han venido buscando. También, es un excelente tiempo para invertir o hacer un nuevo negocio. Sin embargo, aunque las cosas estén demasiado bien, es importante que presten demasiada atención a la parte emocional, no es hora de descuidar sus relaciones sentimentales con amigos, familiares o pareja. El número interesante para Géminis es 7099 4. Cáncer (21 de junio al 22 de julio) No es momento de que dejen de proyectar o visualizar las cosas que quieren, hay que seguir adelante siempre con firmeza porque vendrán cosas donde tendrán excelentes resultados. Asimismo, van a llegar amigos que querrán extenderles una mano de ayuda, habrá que aprovecharla al máximo. A algunos de ustedes se les va a presentar la oportunidad de realizar un viaje, sea de negocios, estudio o turismo, es momento de hacerlo porque algo bueno sucederá. El número de la suerte para Cáncer es 4078 5. Leo (23 de julio al 22 de agosto) Las personas nacidas bajo el signo de Leo deberán revisar exhaustivamente unos documentos o papeles que les estarán llegando para algo que quieren solucionar muy pronto. También, recibirán una grata sorpresa sobre un negocio que están montando o un proyecto que van a realizar, pues todo les saldrá de maravilla. El número relevante para los Leo es 9411 6. Virgo (23 de agosto al 22 de septiembre) Llega un periodo de adaptación para los nacidos en Virgo, donde deberán hacer algunos cambios para renovar y atraer lo que quieren. Es fundamental que no se apeguen a las cosas que ya no pueden mantener; por ejemplo, si deben vender una casa o un carro es el momento de hacerlo. Mucho cuidado con la parte emocional porque tendrán que buscar la manera de mejorar, equilibrar o fortalecer todos los lazos tanto familiares como sentimentales de pareja, esto con el fin de que todo marche mejor. Por su parte, recibirán noticias del extranjero, puede ser la llegada de alguien que vive lejos o un viaje que pronto le saldrá. El número especial para Virgo es 0528 7. Libra (23 de septiembre al 22 de octubre) Tendrán buenos momentos económicos porque les llegará un dinero, un ingreso extra o se ganarán plata que les permitirá mantener una estabilidad financiera. Por su parte, quienes estén esperando una respuesta sobre un trabajo o empleo, recibirán una respuesta muy favorable. Las personas nacidas bajo este signo que se van a realizar un tratamiento estético o una cirugía, podrán hacerlo porque tendrán buenos resultados. El número para Libra hoy es el 6111 8. Escorpio (23 de octubre al 21 de noviembre) Las cosas llevan su tiempo, tienen su momento y siempre habrá que seguir luchando para alcanzar los objetivos propuestos; sin embargo, deberán actuar bajo la calma. Llegará un dinero muy bueno, pero es importante que lo sepan invertir. Por su parte, algunos de ustedes se mudarán de casa o arreglarán el lugar donde están viviendo, esto será demasiado positivo porque les traerá una completa renovación de energía. El número para Escorpio hoy es 8885 9. Sagitario (22 de noviembre al 21 de diciembre) Para esta ocasión, el tarotista menciona que los nacidos bajo este signo zodiacal tendrán una enorme mejoría en todos los aspectos, es decir, en cuanto a salud, dinero y amor; asimismo, las cosas estarán en completa armonía. El número para Sagitario es el 6418 10. Capricornio (22 de diciembre al 19 de enero) Se aclarará por fin esa situación o problema por el que estaban pasando y podrán mejorar e incluso fortalecer lazos. Estarán sumamente bendecidos con todo lo que tenga que ver con trabajo o negocios porque vendrá la abundancia, así como la estabilidad. Quienes planeen hacer una inversión para un negocio deberán asesorarse muy bien e incluso leer con lupa todos los papeles que firmarán para que queden las cosas claras y no existan sorpresas más adelante. Número de la suerte para Capricornio es 8714 11. Acuario (20 de enero al 18 de febrero) Los nacidos bajo este signo deberán tener especial cuidado con las personas negativas que tienen a su alrededor porque van a intentar sacarlos de casillas para que no puedan seguir avanzando.

Viene para los Acuarios algo muy interesante relacionado con el trabajo debido a que recibirán nuevas propuestas o proyectos que tendrán excelentes resultados. El número especial para este signo es 4815 12.
