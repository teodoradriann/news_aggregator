    "text": "( MENAFN - The Conversation) Imagine you're a fairywren living in a patch of scrub behind a schoolyard in the suburbs. It's been pretty nice so far, but a recent increase in neighbourhood cats and the council's insect control tactics mean it's time to look for somewhere safer to live.\nThere's a problem, though. You're a small, bright blue bird that tends to make short flights from shrub to shrub, staying safe in the foliage. Beyond your little patch of habitat, there don't seem to be any places you can easily access. On one side are wide-open sportsfields; on the other, a busy six-lane road. Where do you go?\nIt's a bad situation for a fairywren, and for many other native species in cities. In ecology, we call this habitat fragmentation.\nThe map of suitable habitat for city-dwelling wildlife often looks like a scattering of islands in an inhospitable sea of other land uses. These species face threats or barriers such as roads, buildings, fences and feral predators. This poses several issues, such as barring access to feeding areas, increasing competition for nesting spaces within habitat patches and even reducing gene flow by making it hard to find mates.\nOur newly published research shows how native species in our cities can benefit if we focus on creating strategically located green spaces to connect isolated patches of habitat.\nNative species are at risk whenever they venture beyond the safety of urban habitat patches. MomentsForZen/Flickr , CC BY-NC-ND Why we should care for urban species Despite the myriad challenges facing plants, animals and insects in urban areas, cities are important places to take care of our native species. Urban areas still offer valuable nesting and feeding resources, especially for tree-dwelling mammals, canopy-feeding birds and water-adapted species.\nIn addition to their value for conservation , urban habitats are precious spaces for people to encounter nature in the places we live and work . Urban nature has been shown to be important in balancing out the stresses of city life, particularly in disadvantaged communities . It's also good for our physical health and social connectedness – it even improves cognitive development in children .\nUnsurprisingly, studies have shown people want more nature in their cities.\nBut actively supporting native species hasn't generally been the norm in many cities. The practice of planning and design to deliberately bring nature back into urban areas is still developing. Our open-access research paper in Landscape and Urban Planning offers insights into how we can tackle one aspect of the problem: habitat fragmentation.\nThami Croeser explains the research findings on how best to create links between fragmented wildlife habitat. What did the study look at? We examined how greening projects could best connect up habitat for New Holland honeyeaters (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), blue-banded bees (Amegilla spp) and mole crickets (Gryllotalpa spp) in Melbourne, Victoria. These are all species that occur locally but experience some degree of habitat fragmentation.\nWe have a lot of greening to do for climate adaptation and to create open space for new residents in our growing cities. What if we could also do this greening in a way that boosts habitat for non-human residents too?\nWe compared a scenario where a large number of small green spaces (formerly parking spaces) were created mainly for climate adaptation purposes, to a pair of scenarios where a smaller number of green spaces were created exclusively in areas that had been identified as key links between habitat fragments.\nMaps showing the areas targeted for creating green spaces to link fragmented patches of habitat. T. Croeser et al 2024 , CC BY What were the findings? In total, the benefit of each space in the targeted scenario was more than double that of the scenario where we placed green spaces for climate adaptation purposes, even with the same design of individual green spaces.\nHere's an image of the kind of green spaces we modelled in this study.\nA biodiverse green space with a street tree (1), habitat resources such as understorey plants (2) and stormwater infiltration using a sunken 'raingarden' design (3) effectively de-paves the area of the parking space (4). T. Croeser et al 2022 , CC BY We found significant benefits for two of our three species when green spaces were located in a way that specifically targeted habitat connections.\nBlue-banded bees and mole crickets did especially well. It is trickier for these small creatures to navigate the space between habitat patches. When these small green spaces provided“stepping stones” between bigger patches, they greatly increased the area of habitat a bee or cricket could reach.\nBlue-banded bees greatly benefited from creating green spaces to connect isolated patches of habitat. AjayTvm/Shutterstock\nMole crickets aren't made for travelling long distances between areas of suitable habitat. Donald Hobern/Flickr , CC BY Linking up habitats when we create new green spaces is one way to give native species a chance in our cities. It also gives us (and our kids) a better chance of having everyday nature experiences.\nOf course, adding this“ecosystem connectivity” lens to our green space planning isn't a biodiversity panacea. We'll still need to deliver a lot of new greenery.\nAnd we'll have to design it carefully to support native animals while also providing cooling, reduced flood risk and recreational spaces. We also need to make sure we're picking the right species to model our maps on, and then design our spaces for.\nStill, if we get this right, that fairywren might just one day have small, green“stepping stones” to find their way around the city to a happy new home.\nMENAFN19072024000199003603ID1108458034",

    "text": "Megan Fox surpreendeu ao um clique natural nas redes sociais nesta quinta-feira, 18, e chocou seus seguidores com aparência por Rafaela Dionello, sob supervisão de Priscilla Comoti Publicado em 18/04/2024, às 17h57 Megan Fox surpreendeu seus seguidores ao postar uma foto com um visual diferente do que eles estão acostumados em um clique no espelho e confundiu seguidores. A artista geralmente aposta em mega produções de maquiagem e encantou seguidores com um registro do rosto limpo, mas também os deixou confusos: \"Quem é essa?\", comentou um fã. A artista surgiu no Instagram com uma calça de pijama e um sutiã preto, com os cabelos soltos e de cara limpa. Na legenda, a artista contou que estava passando por um processo de reparação do cabelo e de suas extensões, brincou ela - que estão em um tom de azul bebê. \"Enquanto mais ela envelhece, mais nova ela fica. Como isso é possível?\", escreveu uma seguidora. \"Você não é a Megan Fox\", criticou um internauta, \"Megan não pode fazer anda sem que as pessoas tentam deixá-la para baixo. Faça o que acha melhor, garota. Você está fabulosa assim\", rebateu uma fã da artista, “Você é linda sempre”, declarou uma outra. Ver essa foto no Instagram Recentemente, Megan participou do podcast Call Her Daddye falou sobre as polêmicas envolvendo cirurgia plástica . Aos 37 anos e mãe de 3 filhos, ela conta que já aplicou botox e preenchimento no rosto, a fim de combater a flacidez e estimular a produção de colágeno. E ainda, de acordo com a atriz, já foram investidos US$ 30 mil, – cerca de R$ 150 mil – em silicone nos seios. “[Meus seios] são falsos desde que eu tinha 21 ou 22 anos. Eu fiz plástica entre o primeiro e o segundo Transformers. Mas eu fiz de forma conservadora, porque naquela época todo mundo colocava os implantes, mas era preciso fazer algo que fosse imperceptível”, iniciou ela. “Não fiquei feliz com o primeiro implante. Mandei refazê-los depois que terminei de amamentar meus filhos, porque não sei para onde meus seios foram, mas foram embora. Então tive que refazê-los muito recentemente porque na primeira vez eu não tinha gordura corporal suficiente para disfarçar – dava para ver a ondulação dos implantes”, revelou. Para completar, ela revelou que ainda deseja fazer intevenções em seu bumbum. \"Como se eu fosse caminhar por um parque, e me virasse e todos estivessem sussurrando, rindo e conversando porque eles dizem 'O quê?' como se eu fosse uma aberração de circo\", comentou. Megan ainda completou o assunto dizendo que não fez mais procedimentos ainda porque sente medo de anestesia.",

    "text": "New Documentary, The Retirement Deception, Sheds New Light On Retirement In the compelling documentary, \"The Retirement Deception,\" executive producer, Connie Fox, takes a stand against the misleading narratives surrounding retirement planning.\nBest-selling authors and producers, Brett Kitchen and Ethan Kap, journey over 18,000 miles to delve into the lives of real American retirees, uncovering the true essence of what constitutes a happy and successful retirement.\nThis film boldly challenges the entrenched beliefs and strategies touted by financial experts and questions the effectiveness of Wall Street's favorite retirement-building strategy of investing all of your money in a fluctuating stock market. Instead, \"The Retirement Deception\" seeks to uncover the real keys to a successful retirement. Questioning whether it is amassing a large nest egg, securing high investment returns, or finding a brilliant financial advisor, that results in income and happiness during retirement, or if it is something else altogether?\nThrough their journey, Kitchen and Kap bring to light stories from retirees who have strayed from Wall Street's conventional playbook. These narratives present a more layered and honest perspective on what it really takes to achieve financial security and emotional well-being in retirement.\n\"The Retirement Deception\" proposes a refreshing viewpoint, suggesting that a fulfilling retirement is not solely dependent on wealth. The documentary offers a window into the lives of ordinary Americans who have triumphed over typical retirement challenges like inflation, market volatility, taxes, and longevity.\nThis film is a must-see for anyone planning for or considering retirement.

    "text": "Viale Campania resta chiuso un altro mese, la pioggia ha allagato il cantiere\nRitardi per i lavori di ripristino del collettore di viale Campania: il tratto compreso tra l’intersezione con via Teano/Tronto/Verbano (all’altezza del civico 64) e via Philips non riaprirà entro fine mese, come inizialmente previsto. BrianzAcque ha comunicato che per arrivare a conclusione bisognerà attendere la seconda metà di aprile, a causa delle condizioni di pioggia che hanno caratterizzato la fine di febbraio e la prima decade di marzo, con allagamenti a piò riprese del cantiere.\n«Le due settimane di piogge hanno rallentato i lavori – comunicano dalla societÃ -. Ora grazie al bel tempo, sono state apposte le travi che sosterranno la copertura del manufatto”. Fino ad allora, come dal 19 gennaio a questa parte, resterÃ pertanto solo una la corsia di viale Campania aperta al traffico. Intanto lâ€™attivitÃ di ripristino di BrianzAcque ha ripreso con slancio, con una “task force” di circa venti persone al giorno tra operai, progettisti e direttori dei lavori impegnati in cantiere, avviandosi verso lo step conclusivo di un intervento non semplice, considerando che il tratto di collettore fognario da ripristinare â€“ che ha causato un enorme voragine in strada lo scorso 31 dicembre â€“ Ã¨ un manufatto di 2 metri per 3, di produzione artigianale (tra i piÃ¹ grandi della cittÃ ), con una portata tra i 300 e 350 litri al secondo in assenza di pioggia, e che va allocato a una profonditÃ di 7 metri.\nMartedì le imprese hanno gettato le travi in cemento armato destinate a sostenere la soletta di copertura del manufatto realizzato ad hoc in corrispondenza del punto di collassamento della tubazione che, dal Nord della Brianza, piega su viale Campania fino a raggiungere il depuratore di San Rocco. Per far sì che il calcestruzzo possa arrivare a “maturazione“ e reggere i carichi della strada servono 28 giorni, trascorsi i quali la “cameretta“ sarà coperta e chiusa con lastre prefabbricate. Sarà il passaggio finale che consentirà il rinterro, l’asfaltatura e la riapertura del viale alla circolazione in tutte e quattro le corsie di marcia. L’intervento per riparare la spalla del collettore si è svolto in più fasi che hanno visto la realizzazione di una struttura di micropali per la messa in sicurezza dell’area e la realizzazione della cameretta di 6 metri per 5.",

I think these people, you have to realize that, but even more so, you can’t give money.
