    "text": "How Rolex Testimonees are making lasting contributions to marine preservation and conservation\nOver the last half-century, Rolex has been committed to supporting explorers such as Sylvia Earle of Mission Blue and Titouan Bernicot of Coral Gardeners.\nBy Noor Amylia Hilda /\nAs the world faces a battering of climate threats, the ocean remains our best ally for now. Playing a crucial role in regulating the global climate with its oxygenating capabilities and as a thermal regulator, the preservation of the ocean and its marine life is of utmost importance for the sake of the planet.\nFew people have dedicated their lives to this cause. Sylvia Earle is one such person whose name is synonymous with marine preservation. The marine biologist and Rolex Testimonee since 1982, founded Mission Blue in 2009, a project that identifies particularly significant biodiversity areas called Hope Spots.\nMission Blue’s efforts go hand in hand with Rolex’s dedication to excellence, a brand that has accompanied pioneer explorers over the last half-century. As one of the longstanding partners of the Rolex Perpetual Planet Initiative, Rolex supports Mission Blue’s goal to help protect 30 per cent of the world’s seas by 2030.\nSays Earle, “We are facing maybe the most important time in human history. We have a choice about the future, armed with technologies that did not exist until, right about now.”\n“Knowledge that has been acquired during my lifetime about the ocean, about who we are, where we come from, that perspective about the danger that we are now in, is cause for hope. Never before have we had a better chance to have a perpetual future ourselves with a planet that works in our favour. We are right on the edge of losing that opportunity,” she adds.\nEarle, who has been a pioneer of ocean exploration for over five decades believes there is still hope if action can be taken urgently. “When I first began exploring the ocean, the ocean was a much healthier place. Now, about half the coral reefs globally, are gone. In some places, more than 80 to 90 per cent are gone. And 90 per cent of the sharks are gone. But 10 per cent of the sharks and half of the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape. That is cause for hope.”\nCoral reefs make up some of the most crucial lifeforms that protect coastlines and serve as a source of life for many marine life. For Titouan Bernicot, the founder and CEO of Coral Gardeners, and a Rolex Perpetual Planet Initiative partner since 2022, his mission is to save the reefs before permanent damage is done.\nSince 2017, Bernicot and Coral Gardeners have planted over 100,000 corals, with 10 nursery sites across French Polynesia and Fiji growing approximately 26,000 new corals for planting. Coral Gardeners also have the largest social media presence of any reef conservation company, with over half a million followers on their Instagram account.\nBernicot states, “Now we need to find solutions. It’s our generation of hope, of action and we can already see some good results and examples. And we’re trying to scale up coral gardening restoration all around the world with technological innovation, and we wake up every morning, thinking about what we can do more for the coral reef.”\nWith Earle’s and Bernicot’s combined efforts, the two initiatives aim to empower local communities to make an impact on their local marine habitats.\nHe continues, “Mission Blue and Coral Gardeners have a lot of similarities. It’s about action, hope and people, you know, it’s not just about protecting or restoring the ocean, it’s about the people. Because we need ocean conservation to become a new lifestyle, we need saving the planet to be something cool, meaningful and fun, people need to be able to, with their hands, participate, we need to bridge the gap between people and the ocean and its conservation.”\nMeanwhile, Earle believes that it all comes down to forging a stronger relationship with nature to ensure a better future for all. “What the Coral Gardeners are doing, what Mission Blue is doing, what Rolex is doing, what everyone, everywhere should be doing, is to care for the natural world as if our lives depend on it, because they do.”",

(WJFW)- The Never Forgotten Honor Flight flew from Mosinee to Washington D.C. and back on September 23. On that flight, 94 Korean and Vietnam Veterans from 13 different Wisconsin counties visited multiple different memorials.Mitch Fisher is a Vietnam Era War Veteran that served in the United States Air Force. He has visited Washington D.C. before but every time, he is moved by the experience, and traveling with the Honor Flight brought new memories.“The monuments, the changing of the guard, I don’t know how many times you can see it but I always feels moved by it, it’s a tremendous experience,” said Fisher. “I stand here and that black wall there are names of 58,000 others on there who served about the same time I did.” Mitch says that when the experience began, nobody had any certainty as to what was to happen during their time in service.“Nobody had any guarantees when we went in, there were no promises or jobs or first duty assignments, anything like that,\" said Fisher. \"Essentially, we all wrote a blank check that said train us to meet your needs and send us where you will, some were not fortunate, the blank check was cashed with a flag draped casket and a military funeral.” Mitch says that despite if you are a Veteran or not, visiting the memorials and monuments in D.C. can help to educate people on what the service members experienced.“I think each of us understand the pain, the heroism, the anxiety, especially of those who waited at home for their return, if you haven’t done it come to D.C. and see these thing yourself it’s important,” said Fisher.Never Forgotten Honor Flight stories will air 9/24/24 - 9/27/24.

    "title": "Patrick Mahomes' Trainer Leaves Daunting 3-Word Response to Raiders' Troll Job",
    "text": "By Benedetto Vitale ,\n2 hours ago The Las Vegas Raiders went viral on Thursday after being spotted with a Kermit the Frog doll dressed as Patrick Mahomes. The doll was reportedly brought to training camp by a fan as they recorded seventh-round rookie Trey Taylor playing with the doll.\nMany have already pointed out the obvious that the Raiders have suddenly given Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs some bulletin board material. That is clearly the case now after Patrick Mahomes' trainer, Bobby Stroupe responded to the viral clip with a daunting three-word message . If this is how Mahomes' trainer feels, then we can only imagine how the star quarterback is approaching the video.\n\"We will remember.\"\nThe original video of the Raiders' Kermit Mahomes doll has since been deleted. However, it was on social media long enough for nearly everyone to see and share it. Reports indicate that no players on the team were \"passing around\" the doll as implied. Instead, Raiders fans simply recorded the rookie safety holding the doll.\nOverall this feels like a bad omen for the Raiders. Especially considering Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs have essentially owned Las Vegas for several years now. Mahomes' career record against the Raiders is currently 10-2 and Kansas City have clinched the AFC West eight consecutive seasons in a row.\nWith that in mind the Chiefs are aiming to win its third Super Bowl in three seasons. If they can accomplish that feat, then they'll become the first franchise in NFL history to earn a three-peat. So, it'll be interesting to see if Kansas City can pull it off.\nKansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes (15) signs autographs for fans after training camp at Missouri Western State University. © Denny Medley-USA TODAY Sports\nThe front office had a solid offseason as they reeled some exciting players to the roster. Marquise \"Hollywood\" Brown should be a legitimate deep threat for Patrick Mahomes. Additionally, the Chiefs selected speedster Xavier Worthy in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft. Kansas City's offense will likely remain atop the NFL standings all season long.\nThere's a chance we see Patrick Mahomes have one of the best years of his career next season with all that fire power. Which would be wildly impressive considering he threw for 4,183 passing yards, 27 touchdowns, and a 67.2 completion percentage last year.\nSo, giving Mahomes and the Chiefs some bulletin board material might not be the best decision. But the Raiders seem confident heading into the season. There is plenty of talent in Las Vegas but the quarterback situation could hinder their chances.\nRelated: Rich Eisen Turns Heads Naming NFL's Top 5 Sleeper Teams, Surprise Playoff Prediction\nRelated: Dak Prescott Hints at Cowboys Departure Amid Contract Drama\nRelated: Titans QB Will Levis is Blowing Minds With 'Impressive' Development at Training Camp\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
