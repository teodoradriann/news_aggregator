    "title": "Parkinson, c'è un un nuovo dispositivo che aiuta a camminare | TG LA7",
    "text": "Buone notizie per i nove milioni di malati di Parkinson nel mondo. I ricercatori del SEAS di Garward e del Sargent College of Health & Rehabilitation Sciences della Bu, hanno creato un dispositivo, definito \" un robot morbido e indossabile \" che migliora il movimento delle persone malate di Parkinson e che li aiuta a camminare senza congelarsi. Il \" blocco\" (o congelamento) è un sintomo comune ai malati che perdono improvvisamente la capacità di muovere i piedi, spesso a meta' del passo, il che fa sì che si creino dei passi incertissimi, che si accorciano fino ad arrestarsi del tutto. Il \"blocco\" è uno dei maggiori responsabili delle cadute nelle persone affette dalla malattia di Parkinson.\nIl nuovo dispositivo Ora questo dispositivo di cui si parla nell'ultimo numero di Nature Medicine . Come si vede nel video allegato, viene indossato attorno ai fianchi e alle cosce, e dà una leggera spinta ai fianchi mentre la gamba oscilla, aiutando il paziente a compiere un passo piu' lungo. Fino ad ora, il \"blocco\" era trattato con una serie di terapie farmacologiche chirurgiche o comportamentali, nessuna delle quali e' particolarmente efficace.\nI ricercatori \"Abbiamo scoperto che una piccola quantita' di assistenza meccanica da parte del nostro abbigliamento robotico morbido ha prodotto effetti istantanei e ha reso piu' fluida la deambulazione in coloro che hanno preso parte allo studio\", ha dichiarato Conor Walsh, professore di ingegneria e scienze applicate Paul A. Maeder presso il SEAS e autore co-corrispondente dello studio. \"Sfruttare i robot indossabili morbidi per prevenire il congelamento dell'andatura nei pazienti con Parkinson ha richiesto una collaborazione tra ingegneri, scienziati della riabilitazione, fisioterapisti, biomeccanici e designer di abbigliamento\", ha detto Walsh, il cui team ha collaborato a stretto contatto con quello di Terry Ellis, professore e presidente del dipartimento di terapia fisica e direttore del Centro di neuroriabilitazione dell'Universita' di Boston.\nL'esperimento su un uomo di 73 anni L'equipe ha trascorso sei mesi di lavoro con un uomo di 73 anni affetto dalla malattia di Parkinson che, nonostante l'uso di trattamenti chirurgici e farmacologici, era soggetto a consistenti e invalidanti episodi di congelamento piu' di dieci volte al giorno, che provocavano frequenti cadute. Questi episodi gli impedivano di camminare nella sua comunita' e lo costringevano ad affidarsi a uno scooter per spostarsi all'esterno.\nIn una ricerca precedente, Walsh e il suo gruppo di ricerca hanno sfruttato l'ottimizzazione human-in-the-loop per dimostrare che un dispositivo morbido e indossabile poteva essere utilizzato per aumentare la flessione dell'anca e aiutare a far oscillare la gamba in avanti, fornendo un approccio efficiente per ridurre il dispendio energetico durante la camminata in individui sani. In questo caso, i ricercatori hanno impiegato lo stesso approccio ma per affrontare il problema del congelamento. Il dispositivo indossabile utilizza attuatori azionati da cavi e sensori indossati intorno alla vita e alle cosce. Utilizzando i dati di movimento raccolti dai sensori, gli algoritmi stimano la fase dell'andatura e generano forze di assistenza in tandem con il movimento muscolare. L'effetto è stato istantaneo. Senza alcun addestramento speciale, il paziente e' stato in grado di camminare senza congelarsi in casa e con episodi occasionali all'aperto. E' stato anche in grado di camminare e parlare senza congelarsi, una rarita' senza il\ndispositivo.\n\"Il nostro gruppo di ricerca era davvero entusiasta di vedere l'impatto della tecnologia sulla camminata dei partecipanti\", ha affermato Jinsoo Kim, ex dottorando del SEAS e coautore dello studio. \"I partecipanti ai nostri studi che offrono volontariamente il loro tempo sono veri e propri partner\", ha sottolineato Walsh. \"Poiche' la mobilità è difficile, per questo individuo e' stata una vera sfida anche solo venire in laboratorio, ma abbiamo beneficiato moltissimo della sua prospettiva e del suo feedback\".\nPer restare aggiornato sulle ultime notizie segui gratis il canale whatsapp del Tgla7\nPuoi anche iscriverti al canale whatsapp della rete la7\nContinua a leggere su Tg.La7.it Ti potrebbe interessare Dragon Firefighter Giappone, ecco il robot pompiere che vola come un dragone Comandato a distanza, interviene negli scenari più rischiosi 28.12.2023",

    "text": "Indira Behara | Time to expand women’s right to make choices about abortion Columnists Indira Behara 4 April 2024 6:14 PM GMT x Breaking the stigma and ensuring access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare is essential for women's autonomy. (Image: storyset by Freepik) Once again, reproductive rights are in the news — this time in the United States where the Supreme Court is hearing cases that seek to restrict access to one of the pills (Mifepristone) that is used for medical abortions.\nWhile we hope for a favourable outcome that protects women’s access to safe abortions, at least we can look back with relief to a few weeks ago, when the French Parliament voted with an overwhelming majority to guarantee a woman’s right to choose whether or not she wants to continue her pregnancy, as a constitutional right.\nMany countries around the world allow abortion on request — some in Europe grant it all the way up to 24 weeks of gestation: around the world from countries in South America, across Africa and to many in South and Southeast Asia, laws have liberalised to protect women’s bodily agency and autonomy. In India, the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act has been around since 1971, and at the time was revolutionary. Recent amendments of 2021 provided much-needed reform to the MTP Act, helping it evolve with the times. To paraphrase:\nn Abortions are allowed up to the gestational age of 20 weeks on the opinion of just one medical practitioner (formally trained in obstetrics and gynaecology).\nn Abortions may be considered and opined on by at least two registered medical practitioners for pregnancies between 20 and 24 weeks occurring in minors, rape or incest victims, and other vulnerable women (like those that are differently-abled).\nn For abortions beyond 24 weeks, a state-level medical board must be constituted to decide whether or not there are significant foetal abnormalities and it can be permitted.\nn A woman’s confidentiality must be protected and her details cannot be revealed except to a person authorised by law.\nImportantly, while the earlier MTP Act focused on married women, the amendments recognise the needs of “any woman”. Anecdotes seem to suggest that in cases crossing the 20-week mark, the process for constituting boards is swift and, medical or judicial, decisions are expedited.\nThe MTP Act, while useful, is still however set not in the context of gender justice and the rights of a woman, but more as a response to protecting physicians that seek to do their job, leaving the decision-making, especially after 20 weeks, in the hands of providers, and later the courts. There have been landmark judgments that work in favour of women such as that from the country’s highest court which has equated a woman’s reproductive choices with her personal liberties and her right to privacy, dignity and bodily integrity. There have been some supportive judgments from various high courts; there have been others that were unfavourable which were appealed and overturned in the Supreme Court. And there have been those, which have adjudicated that a woman must carry through a pregnancy because that is what was decided for her by the treating physicians, and not by her own volition.\nIt is telling that despite its best intentions, our current approach to abortion leaves much to be desired. Unsafe abortions continue to occur in significant numbers, causing morbidity, and is the third leading cause of all maternal deaths in India. Stigma and a lack of awareness, both of their bodies and their rights, as well less than optimal usage of modern contraceptive methods in our country still result in nearly half of all pregnancies being unintended. Access to comprehensive healthcare services in many parts of the country can be difficult for women: We are still far from women having true decision-making power and freedom.\nUndeniably, the public health system and its policies continue to evolve to improve the situation, but perhaps there are considerations that could be made given the supply side bottlenecks and how the delivery of healthcare has evolved. The World Health Organisation’s guidelines allow access to medical (non-surgical, non-invasive) abortions up to 12 weeks of gestation (this is approximately 12 weeks from the last menstrual period or roughly 10 weeks after conception). Is there scope for India to review the nine-week limit for medical abortions in its current guidelines since it is more convenient and less invasive?\nAccess to trained providers who are legally authorised to terminate a pregnancy (medical or surgical) is limited — and we must find ways to open up early access to medical methods.\nCould encouraging the use of telemedicine services, and remotely reviewed ultrasounds particularly in underserved areas — be the answer?\nOne of the greatest barriers of all is limited awareness that people have about their health and related rights, compounded with the ensuing stigma when it comes to sexual health. This will require more effective awareness and education programmes with simple and informative public health messaging around reproductive health, contraceptives, and abortion care. How can we aid physicians, healthcare workers, community leaders and women’s collectives and networks to even out the information asymmetry that persists?\nWe have come a long way — but we do have some distance to go both with respect to our health system and our policies. As a physician and woman, I believe we must go much further to ensure that the decision-making about any woman’s body rests in her hands. I too would like the letter of the law to more definitively protect my right to choose, and my right to life and freedom.\n( Source : Deccan Chronicle )",

    "title": "Delhi HC refuses to permit Shab-e-Barat prayers at Akhoondji mosque in Mehrauli",
    "text": "New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Friday refused to permit prayers at the recently demolished ‘Akhoondji mosque’ and the nearby graveyard in Mehrauli on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat. Muslims seek forgiveness from Allah for their sins and those of their ancestors on Shab-e-Barat (the night of atonement). Justice Purushaindra Kumar Kaurav, while dealing with an application by the Managing Committee of the Delhi Waqf Board, noted that the court has directed status quo on the site which is now in the possession of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA). The application forms part of a petition by the committee on the issue of demolition. Justice Kaurav observed that the main petition, which was heard by the court on several occasions, is already listed for final disposal on March 7. “At this stage, the court is not inclined to pass any directions. The application is dismissed,” ordered the court. The ‘Akhoondji mosque’, believed to be over 600 years old, as well as the Behrul Uloom madrasa there were declared as illegal structures in Sanjay Van and demolished by the DDA on January 30. The counsel for the petitioner said worshippers, whose families are buried in the nearby graveyard, should be allowed offer prayers there on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat later this month. He said the mosque was several centuries old and prayers were being offered there for the last many years. There was also an “active graveyard” which was used by the locals, the advocate told the court. On February 5, the high court had asked the DDA to maintain status quo on the site where the mosque once stood. The petitioner committee has argued that the demolition of the mosque was illegal. The DDA has defended its action before the high court on the ground that the demolition took place pursuant to the January 4 recommendation of its Religious Committee. The decision, it said, was taken after the Religious Committee afforded an opportunity of hearing to the CEO of Delhi Waqf Board. The petitioner has, however, contended that the Religious Committee has no jurisdiction to order any demolition action. On January 31, the court asked the DDA to file its reply clearly setting out the action that has been taken in respect of the property concerned as well as its basis. It also asked the development authority to state whether any prior notice was given before the demolition.",

Gli insegnanti integrano sempre più l’intelligenza artificiale nella didattica, ma emergono questioni di trasparenza verso gli studenti\nPubblicato il 26 giu 2025 Carmelina Maurizio Università degli Studi di Torino\nL’ ingresso dell’Intelligenza Artificiale nel mondo dell’istruzione genera da tempo perplessità, dubbi, dibattiti e il proliferare di occasioni formative, al fine di rendere i docenti più consapevoli ed esperti, soprattutto più in grado di equipaggiarsi di fronte al suo massiccio uso, spesso improprio, da parte di centinaia di migliaia di studenti in tutto il mondo.\nAI Index Report 2024: l’impatto dell’intelligenza artificiale nel mondo dell’istruzione Come gli studenti usano l’IA e cosa li frena Fino a pochissimi mesi fa l’attenzione era tutta rivolta all’uso dell’IA da parte dei discenti. Hepi Uk, il think tank indipendente del Regno Unito dedicato al l’istruzione superiore , nel 2025 ha riscontrato che l’uso di IA da parte degli studenti universitari è aumentato nell’ultimo anno, con quasi il 92% che ora usa l’IA in qualche forma, rispetto al 66% del 2024.\nGli usi principali sono spiegare concetti, riassumere articoli e suggerire idee per la ricerca, ma un numero significativo di studenti – 18% – ha incluso il testo generato dal l’IA direttamente nel loro lavoro.\nQuando viene chiesto loro perché usano l’IA, gli studenti spesso trovano che ciò fa risparmiare tempo e migliora la qualità del loro prodotto.\nI principali fattori che li scoraggiano dall’utilizzare l’IA sono il rischio di essere accusati di cattiva condotta accademica e la paura di ottenere risultati falsi o tendenziosi.\nDiffusione dell’uso dell’IA tra i docenti universitari Ora l’attenzione si sta spostando sui docenti e secondo una ricerca pubblicata da Ithaka S+R nel giugno 2024, circa il 75% dei docenti universitari statunitensi ha già adottato, anche solo parzialmente, strumenti di intelligenza artificiale nelle proprie pratiche didattiche. Dopo un periodo di profondo scetticismo nei confronti del l’IA da parte degli accademici americani, tre quarti dei ricercatori hanno compiuto almeno modesti passi verso l’integrazione del l’IA generativa nel loro insegnamento. L’IA viene utilizzata in vari modi: gli usi più comuni sono la progettazione del materiale didattico (22%), l’aiuto con le e-mail o altre attività amministrative (16%) e la creazione di immagini o visualizzazioni (15%).\nLa maggior parte (66%) dei docenti ha dichiarato di avere almeno una certa familiarità con gli strumenti generativi del l’IA , mentre solo il 16% ha riferito di non averne alcuna.\nIl caso Northeastern e le reazioni globali all’uso dell’IA da parte dei docenti Quanto è successo di recente alla Northeastern University di Boston sembra aver modificato ancora una volta il punto di vista.\nLa studentessa Ella Stapleton ha denunciato il docente Rick Arrowood alla Northeastern dopo aver scoperto che i materiali utilizzati per una lezione e poi condivisi fossero stati generati dall’IA. La richiesta successiva della studentessa è stata quella di riavere indietro la sua rata di iscrizione e dopo alcuni incontri con i funzionari della scuola di business, proprio in queste settimane Stapleton è stata informata che la sua richiesta non sarebbe stata esaudita.\nIl professor Arrowood della Northeastern sotto accusa, docente da oltre 20 anni, ha immediatamente dichiarato di aver caricato i suoi file di classe e documenti su ChatGPT e di aver utilizzato Perplexity, oltre al generatore di presentazione chiamato Gamma; ha messo i materiali online per la revisione degli studenti, ma ha sottolineato che non li ha usati in classe, perché preferisce orientare la discussione in aula, piuttosto che partire da presentazioni.\nL’evento ha suscitato numerose riflessioni e dibattiti ed ha avuto una risonanza globale, proprio perché ha attirato l’attenzione, non solo del mondo dell’istruzione, sui tanti controversi aspetti nell’uso dell’IA poco noti o non ancora scoperti.\nP ercezioni contrastanti e trasparenza nell’uso dell’IA da parte dei professori In un sondaggio nazionale del 2024 che ha coinvolto oltre 1.800 docenti universitari statunitensi, il 18 per cento si è descritto come utenti frequenti di strumenti generativi di IA; in un sondaggio ripetuto quest’anno, tale percentuale è quasi raddoppiata, secondo Tyton Partners, il gruppo di consulenza che ha condotto la ricerca. Da parte loro, i professori hanno anche detto che hanno usato dei chatbots come strumento per fornire una migliore istruzione, impiegandoli come assistenti didattici automatizzati.\nI docenti stanno attirando sempre più l’attenzione dell’opinione pubblica e del mondo della ricerca, entrando nell’occhio del ciclone dopo l’episodio dell’ateneo di Boston.\nIl New York Times ha contattato decine di professori i cui studenti avevano menzionato il loro uso dell’IA nelle recensioni online . I professori hanno detto di aver usato ChatGPT per creare compiti di programmazione informatica e quiz sul testo di lettura richiesto, l’hanno usato per organizzare il loro feedback agli studenti, o per renderlo più comprensibile e informale. Come esperti nel loro campo, hanno detto, possono riconoscere quando si verificano allucinazioni, o se ottengono dati e informazione sbagliati.\nD’altra parte il quotidiano nordamericano sottolinea come siano in crescita le segnalazioni di studenti che lamentano l’uso frequente di AI da parte dei docenti, anche su piattaforme come Rate My Professors .\nAlcuni docenti hanno posto l’accento sull’importanza della trasparenza con gli studenti quando si impiega l’IA generativa, mentre altri hanno detto che non ne rivelano l’uso a causa dello scetticismo degli studenti sulla tecnologia.\nChatbot e IA come assistenti didattici nelle università americane Dalla Virginia Commonwealth University, arriva l’opinione del professore di economia Kwaramba, che ha descritto ChatGPT come un partner che gli ha fatto risparmiare tempo, che ha potuto utilizzare per ricevere con meno fretta gli studenti.\nDavid Malan , notissimo docente di informatica presso la Scuola di Ingegneria e Arti applicate di Harvard, ha detto che l’uso dell’IA ha fatto sì che meno studenti venissero al ricevimento per un aiuto correttivo . Malan ha integrato un chatbot personalizzato in un corso dove insegna i fondamenti della programmazione del computer; le sue centinaia di studenti possono rivolgersi ad esso per l’aiuto con i loro compiti di codifica. Il professore ha allenato il chatbot affinché offrisse una guida ma non la risposta completa e la maggior parte dei 500 studenti intervistati nel 2023, il primo anno in cui è stato offerto, ha detto di trovarlo utile. Anche David Malan ha confermato che ha potuto dedicare maggiore tempo e attenzione alle discussioni con gli studenti, piuttosto che soffermarsi sul materiale introduttivo, che i suoi allievi hanno studiato grazie all’aiuto dell’IA.\nLa docente Katy Pearce, professoressa di comunicazione presso l’Università di Washington, ha sviluppato un chatbot e lo ha addestrato affinché potesse dare agli studenti un feedback sulla loro scrittura in qualsiasi momento, giorno o notte . È stato utile per gli studenti che altrimenti talvolta esitano a chiedere aiuto, ha detto ancora Pearce, affermando che nel futuro gran parte di ciò che gli assistenti didattici degli studenti universitari possono fare potrà essere fatto dall’IA, creando sicuramente problemi a livello di gestione delle carriere accademiche.\nVisioni pedagogiche e paragoni con pratiche tradizionali Paul Shovlin, che insegna all’Ohio University ad Athens, specializzato in IA e Digital Rethorics , è tra coloro che propone di incorporare l’Intelligenza Artificiale nell’insegnamento , affinché gli studenti imparino ad usare la tecnologia in modo responsabile perché quasi certamente lo useranno sul posto di lavoro. Shovlin ha confrontato l’episodio della Northeastern University con una pratica di lunga data nel mondo accademico, quella cioè di utilizzare contenuti, come piani di lezione e studi di casi, da editori terzi.\nIl contesto italiano e l’uso strumentale di ChatGPT nella didattica In Italia non sono ancora stati rilevati episodi analoghi a quello della Northeastern University di Boston e si evince dalle poche ricerche sul campo, a proposito di usi reali e immaginari dei chatbot a livello accademico, che sono ancora maggiori le attenzioni della ricerca sull’uso proprio e improprio degli studenti.\nUno studio condotto da ricercatori dell’Università La Sapienza di Roma [1] ha fatto emergere dalle analisi delle risposte discorsive u na prevalenza dell’uso strumentale (vs uso esplorativo maggiormente condizionato da immaginari svicolati dalle pratiche), ovvero finalizzato a obiettivi specifici. Si tratta della forma di relazione con l’intelligenza artificiale più diffusa tra i docenti , che se ne avvalgono per attività mirate come insegnamento, ricerca, compiti organizzativi e compiti amministrativi. L’uso strumentale di ChatGPT da parte dei docenti costituisce una forma di allineamento tra pratiche e immaginari derivanti dal bagaglio di conoscenze a disposizione dei docenti italiani , mentre le risposte appaiono più frammentate e incerte se si chiede loro di immaginare il futuro di questa innovazione tecnologica, facendo divergere immaginari e possibili usi futuri.\nNote",
