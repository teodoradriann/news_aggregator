    "text": "February 15, 2024 Contact Information EPA Region 4 Press Office ( ) (404) 562-8400 FRANKFORT, Ky. (Feb. 15, 2024) – The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced the expansion of its successful Closing America's Wastewater Access Gap Community Initiative to 150 additional communities as part of President Biden’s Investing America agenda. Originally launched in partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the pilot initiative has been assisting 11 communities since 2022. This program, along with historic funding through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, will help thousands of Americans access the wastewater infrastructure they need to thrive to include Harlan County, Ky.\n“Many rural and low-income communities in the U.S. lack basic running water and indoor plumbing, and our Closing America’s Wastewater Access Gap Program has been instrumental in helping communities from White Hall, Alabama to McDowell County, West Virginia to the San Carlos Apache Tribe in Arizona access Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding to address this critical need,” said EPA Assistant Administrator for Water Radhika Fox. “In expanding the program to 150 additional communities, we are working to restore dignity and opportunity to underserved communities nationwide.”\nClosing America’s Wastewater Access Gap Community Initiative\nAn estimated 2 million people in the U.S. live without adequate wastewater infrastructure and safe and reliable drinking water in their homes. Many more live with wastewater infrastructure that is ineffective and puts people’s health at risk. To date, the initiative has helped provide communities with no cost technical assistance that helps identify affordable options accessing wastewater infrastructure. For example, technical assistance providers help the community conduct assessments of the community’s specific needs and submit applications for wastewater funding. So far progress for the 11 pilot communities includes seven funding awards and 10 additional funding applications submissions. All 11 communities have drafted community solution plans, which are in the process of being finalized, and will be posted to EPA’s Closing America's Wastewater Access Gap webpage in the early spring.\nHarlan County, Kentucky, Projects\nThe cities of Cumberland, Benham, and Lynch are discussing options to address compliance issues and are coordinating with Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet on next steps. Technical assistance providers continue to support the three cities with conducting rate studies and assessing wastewater system challenges, such as infiltration and inflow. The three cities of Cumberland, Benham, and Lynch share common city boundaries and are in need of long-term solutions to address numerous issues and violations with sewage collection systems and wastewater treatment plants. The pilot initiative explored many options to address these issues, including shared services and development of a new wastewater entity. The pilot initiative helped facilitate community engagement between all three cities. The events experienced good public participation and engagement. Each city is assessing options and has started to address infiltration and inflow issues with assistance from technical assistance providers. Interested communities can request assistance by completing the WaterTA request form .\nCommunities will be selected on a rolling basis; there is no deadline to apply. For questions, email SepticHelp@epa.gov.\nLearn more about EPA’s WaterTA services and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s historic $50 billion investment in America.\n###",

    "text": "KARACHI: The government of Sindh has decided to take action against those who are stockpiling urea fertilizer and selling it at high prices. The decision was made at a meeting held under the chairmanship of Sindh Chief Secretary Dr Muhammad Fakhre Alam and was attended by Agriculture Secretary Syed Aijaz Shah, Karachi Commissioner Muhammad Saleem Rajput and Director General Extension, Manir Ahmad Jamani. Other Divisional Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners also participated in the meeting through video link. A detailed briefing was provided during the meeting regarding the demand for urea fertilizer and its supply to farmers. The Agriculture Department officials highlighted that penalties amounting to Rs. 4 million have been imposed against 175 hoarders in the province. Furthermore, licenses of 41 dealers have been suspended. Division Commissioners also gave a briefing on measures to ensure the supply of fertilizers at discounted prices. Chief Secretary Sindh Dr. Muhammad Fakhre Alam directed all Deputy Commissioners to ensure 100% stock verification of urea fertilizer in their respective districts. Strict action will be taken against the hoarders of urea. The amount of fine should also be increased and if the dealer is found repeatedly involved in hoarding, further action should be taken against the dealer as per law. He further said that the stored urea fertilizer should be confiscated and auctioned at the official rate. Chief Secretary Sindh said that it will be recommended to the federal government that all deputy commissioners should be given access to the dashboard related to urea fertilizer so that stock verification and action against hoarders can be done effectively.

    "title": "Histórico: el gol con el que San Marino, “la peor selección del mundo”, ganó un partido tras 20 años - Infobae",
    "text": "* El video del grito de Sensoli\nSan Marino , el equipo más débil del planeta según el ranking de la FIFA, donde ocupa la posición 210, ha logrado lo inesperado: cortó una racha maldita de 141 partidos sin ganar con una histórica victoria por 1-0 contra Liechtenstein en la UEFA Nations League .\nNicko Sensoli , un joven de apenas 19 años, fue el héroe de la jornada al marcar el gol solitario que decidió el encuentro. Su tanto fue suficiente para que San Marino rompiera con veinte años de sequía de victorias, desde el último triunfo logrado el 28 de abril de 2004, también contra Liechtenstein.\nSucedió a los 52 minutos de partido, cuando tras un centro al área de los derrotados fue peinado por un defensor, otro durmió, y el citado Sensoli, por atrás, apareció para pellizcar el balón y batir al arquero adversario. El equipo y los fanáticos celebraron dicho triunfo como si fuera la final del Mundial. La victoria ha sido apenas la segunda en la historia del conjunto sanmarinense; la primera en un cotejo oficial.\nEste hito resalta aún más al considerar la racha desfavorable de San Marino: 141 partidos sin conocer la victoria, acumulando apenas seis empates y 135 derrotas, con 21 goles a favor y 568 en contra.\nEl impacto del triunfo se extiende también por la geografía y demografía del pequeño país. San Marino, con una población de cerca de 36,000 habitantes dispersos en 61,2 km², ha encontrado una razón para celebrar que unifica a todos sus ciudadanos. Los festejos se extendieron hasta el Palazzo Pubblico, donde se congregaron cientos de personas para compartir la alegría de un logro tan esquivo.\nNo obstante, a pesar de la alegría del momento, la historia de San Marino en el fútbol es rica en derrotas, pero también en pequeñas alegrías, como los empates históricos contra otras selecciones. Entre estas igualdades se destacan dos con Liechtenstein (en un amistoso y en otra Liga de Naciones), dos en Eliminatorias mundialistas (contra Turquía y Letonia), uno en Eliminatorias para la Eurocopa (Estonia) y algunos otros como contra Gibraltar, Seychelles (el primer empate contra una selección de otro continente), Santa Lucía y San Cristóbal y Nieves.\nEste reciente éxito también puede considerarse como una continuación de una tímida pero visible mejoría en la capacidad ofensiva de San Marino. De hecho, venía de convertir en cuatro partidos consecutivos por primera vez.\nUn argentino fue parte de la gesta: se trata de Dante Rossi , categoría 87, y oriundo de Pergamino. De pasado en la cantera de Newell’s, actuó como titular, terminó con la cinta de capitán en el brazo y se integró a la montonera con la que el plantel celebró un hito involvidable para el conjunto que durante décadas fue calificado como “la peor selección del mundo” .\nAl margen de lo que este triunfo pueda significar en términos de puntos y clasificaciones futuras, lo más importante para San Marino es el impacto emocional y el histórico que tiene para el país y sus habitantes. Un gol, por sencillo que pueda parecer, ha puesto fin a dos décadas de frustración deportiva.",

    "text": "O jornalista David Montero seguiu o rasto do dinheiro desde a fundação do seu país, os Estados Unidos. Escreveu um livro que ajuda a entender o fosso entre ricos e pobres. A escravatura está na raiz. O que significa reparação quando aplicada a um passado ligado a potências escravocratas e colónias? A pergunta tem cada vez mais importância quanto mais divide opiniões e leva à criação de um pensamento ou de narrativas que põem em causa ou complexificam as tradicionais. David Montero, jornalista premiado, vai à génese do seu país, os Estados Unidos, para mostrar que “a ferida aberta” sobre a qual ele se fundou não se refere apenas ao passado nem ao Sul. Diz que os grandes bancos do Norte, como o Citibank ou o Bank of America, financiaram a escravatura e beneficiaram fortemente do seu envolvimento nesse tipo de negócios, fazendo parte de uma economia que cresceu exercendo poder sobre o corpo negro. Montero diz ainda que esta não é uma questão do passado. É do presente e do futuro. E não apenas da nação americana. Tem ramificações na Europa e no resto do mundo. Para chegar a essas conclusões, cruzou factos, fez investigação histórica e jornalística e propõe um novo olhar sobre o termo reparação em The Stolen Wealth of Slavery: A Case for Reparations. Esteve em Lisboa para participar no seminário Slavery Impacts & Meaningful Change, na Faculdade de Ciências Sociais da Universidade Nova de Lisboa, organizado pela Unbreakable Heritage, vocacionada para a educação, defesa, promoção e sensibilização para a realidade histórica e os impactos actuais da escravatura negra enquanto genocídio.",

There is so much to play for.\"\nIt was a cathartic victory for Arsenal, who had been knocked out of the FA Cup third round by 10-man Manchester United on penalties on Sunday, just days after losing 2-0 at home to Newcastle in the League Cup semi-final first leg.\nBut Arteta, whose side face another test against Aston Villa tomorrow, was relieved to see his players show the hunger.\n\"We were sensational. It was a big test after two games and not getting rewarded,\" he said.\n\"We were incredibly good in the last game against United and we ended up losing somehow.\n\"It's how you respond to a situation... they want to go on the pitch.\n\"It was a test of attitude, what we are made of, the courage we have. From minute one, we fully deserved to win.\"\nAnge Postecoglou slammed his Tottenham flops as \"nowhere near good enough\" after the defeat in which Spurs \"were too passive.\"\n\"Too many losses this year.
