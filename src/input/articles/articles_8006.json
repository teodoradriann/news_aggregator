Recently, the quarterback's wife, Kelly Stafford opened up about daughter Tyler's surging interest in watching and learning about NFL.\nIn the new episode of \"The Morning After\" podcast released on Wednesday, Kelly recalled how her daughter, Tyler, snuggled with her to watch the Los Angeles Rams beat the New York Jets in the Week 17 clash. Describing how Tyler kept on asking so many \"questions\" about the game, Kelly said:\n\"I love that Tyler asked if she could snuggle and watch the game with me last night. I was like 'Oh my God,' and she had questions. She was just like 'Mommy, why do they tackle that guy, like why don't they tackle everyone? Like why does the guy carrying the ball?'

And she was like, 'Well, why doesn't he just give the ball to somebody else when he gets tackled?' You know she's asking these questions and it's freaking adorable,\" Kelly concluded. (27:52) Talking about kids, Kelly Stafford previously confessed about cursing around her kids while watching Rams games.\nMatthew Stafford's wife Kelly feels no 'guilt' for swearing around kids In an episode of \"The Morning After\" podcast on Dec. 10, Kelly Stafford opened up about using \"bad words\" around her kids, especially while watching LA Rams' games. Talking about how she doesn't regret cussing around them, Kelly said:\n\"You marry someone who loves sports, who's competitive like Matthew is, I'm sure he was down there cussing up a storm and I was in the suite cussing up a storm. Now my kids are used to it. They know those are adult words. We've talked about this. So I don't feel bad doing it in front of them.\" (27:43)\n\"I think Tyler said 'sh*t' when she was two. But other than that, and it was one time and I was like, 'Absolutely not.' Other than that, they know. Then on my belief, you're going to hear these words from people like me, who are, you're not expecting and I don't want you ever to repeat them, you know,\" Kelly concluded. Kelly Stafford has been quite open about sharing her personal life on her podcast. After her previous confession of using therapy , the podcaster recently revealed that she has been battling with sleep issues.\n× Feedback Why did you not like this content?

    "text": "UK’s new visa rule will now permit people on tourist visa to work in the country\n106475772As per the latest development, starting from January 31, the United Kingdom is all set to implement substantial changes to its visa regulations. These changes will open up new avenues for business endeavours for individuals holding visitor visas.\nAs per the latest updates, tourist visa holders will now be granted permission to engage in work-related activities with clients and undertake remote work while visiting the UK. It’s expected that this move will provide a considerable boost to both business and tourism within the country.\nIf reports are to go by, the UK Government has also released an update to its immigration rules, allowing expanded activities on Visitor Visas, with the changes slated to come into effect from January 31, 2024.\n106381514So, here are some of the key points of the revised rules:\nEmployees of companies with branches in both the UK and internationally can engage in client work abroad, provided it constitutes a small portion of their overseas responsibilities, which is crucial for a project or service by their UK branch, and is not directly delivered to a UK client by the overseas employer. While visitors can work remotely from the UK, the primary purpose of their stay should not be remote work. Scientists, researchers, and academics are permitted to conduct research in the UK, with certain exceptions for academics applying for a 12-month visit visa or seeking permission extensions within the country. Lawyers will be allowed to engage in additional activities, such as providing advice, acting as an expert witness, participating in legal proceedings, and teaching. The Permitted Paid Engagement (PPE) Visitor route will be integrated into the Standard Visitor route, eliminating the need for a separate visa for those involved in paid engagements, though they must still plan the activity within 30 days of arrival. 106475786Last month, Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt pledged that the UK Government would expand business visitor rules to enable business people to take part in a broader range of permitted activities and paid engagements, effective from January 2024.\nThese changes, particularly the allowance for remote work, are expected to have a positive impact on both business and tourism in the United Kingdom. Additional changes to the regulations for business visitors are expected in 2024.",

We are sad but not shocked — authorities, media and other groups have regularly downplayed or ignored the growing #Hinduphobia in the region,” CoHNA said in a post on X on Friday.\n“People who put those symbols and names up…what they are promoting is a separate state of Khalistan… So if those people who did this want that, that’s something that I think most Americans, most Indians, most Hindus don’t want,” Mihir Meghani, co-founder of Hindu American Foundation, told CBS News. Meghani said the Indian-American community in the Bay Area is growing, and these political issues are now becoming a part of the division here. The incident comes just after the US Justice Department unsealing an indictment against an Indian national for his alleged involvement in a foiled plot to kill New York-based Khalistan leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun.

    "title": "Could Pittsburgh Pirates Have Two Cy Young Candidates?",
    "text": "Could Pirates Have Two Cy Young Candidates?\nPittsburgh Pirates ace Paul Skenes has already emerged as a household name on the heels of a historic first season that won him the National League Rookie of the Year and finished third in the NL Cy Young vote.\nCould another Pirates pitcher cement himself as one of baseball's rising stars next season? Bleacher Report's Joel Reuter listed a breakout candidate for every team and tabbed Jared Jones for Pittsburgh. Along with listing him as a breakout candidate, Reuter believes Jones can have the kind of season that ranks him among the best pitchers in baseball in 2025.\n\"If you're thinking that Jones is no Paul Skenes, well, you're not wrong,\" Reuter writes. \"But here's a fun fact that you'll know only if you're a total nerd: Per Stuff+, Jones' pitches were better than those of Skenes and all other National League pitchers in 2024. The 97.3 mph fastball is nice, but not quite as nice as Jones' devastating slider. Those things alone have the potential to make him an All-Star this year, and perhaps even a Cy Young Award contender.\"\nIt was a tale of two halves for Jones in his rookie season. In the first half, he was 5-6 with a 3.56 ERA in 16 starts and struck out 98 batters over 91 innings pitched. Things took a turn with a strained right lat costing the then-rookie right-hander nearly two months of the season and upon returning, Jones made six starts and went 1-2 while posting a 5.87 ERA.\nOverall, Jones was 6-8 with a 4.14 ERA over 22 starts and struck out 132 batters in 121.2 innings pitched.\nJones' stuff is among the most exciting things about his game and why he has the potential to emerge as one of the better pitchers in baseball. His slider was arguably his best pitch, as it had a 37.3 percent whiff rate by Baseball Savant's metrics. With one season under his belt, there's no reason to believe the Pittsburgh right-hander's stuff can't be even better in 2025.\nIf Jones can stay healthy, becoming an All-Star in his second season isn't far-fetched. And if Jones can pitch up to that level, the tandem of him and Skenes can be one of baseball's best and help the Pirates' chances of reaching the playoffs for the first time since 2015.\nMake sure to visit Pirates OnSI for the latest news, updates, interviews and insight on the Pittsburgh Pirates",
