    "text": "Even In Death Gazans Speak Out – OpEd\nDespite the atrocities carried out by the Israeli occupation in Gaza and the mayhem that has been created, Palestinians even in death, swore to resist and relent against an ungodly power spurned by revenge and blind hate.\nIsraeli warplanes have turned the lives of Palestinians upside down, internal refugees in their homeland despite the fact they are already under siege and occupation.\nSome of these people sought refuge in Al Aqsa University in Khan Younis but with black markings on the walls.\nCenter for displaced persons\nAl Aqsa University has been turned into a center for the displaced.\nThousands of people from all over the strip came here in search of a safe place because of nowhere to go, chased by guns from the air.\nThe Israelis, and their warplanes got to hear of the congregation and started to bomb the place and thus it became a haven no more. The displaced are supposed to keep moving according to the Israeli wrapped mentality.\nThe bombs became so deep, the University’s sewers were destroyed and the filthy water surfaced on the ground, as if telling the people “you have to live our way or else”.\nPeople have\nspoken of the terrible stench, not to mention of the incredible health risks such heinous bombings cause. People say they have already come here with family members who are in a bad state of heath.\nTalk of the situation of Al Aqsa University has been going viral on the social media but it is only one example of the sufferings of civilians who in this Israeli war, have had to move in search of safe places. They are ordered to by leaflets dropped from the air followed by big guns and hefty bombs.\nThousands initially came to the university because it was seen as relatively safe. Indeed, initially they came here because they were told the university\nhad large spaces with water and electricity but no more.\nIsrael’s war has so far displaced 1.9 million Palestinians out of a total Gaza population of 2.2 million with at least 60 percent of housing units destroyed. The population is now being concentrated in the south of the strip. But even here, there is no respite with cities like Rafah and camps like Nuseirat being bombed all the time.\n‘I am not a number’\nAl Aqsa University was a major part of Khan Younis and society graduating 1000s of people in different areas such as the natural sciences, marketing, media studies and IT who have been killed by Israel bombings.\nAnd then there is the names. This war is ending the lives of many of the professional cadres in Gazan society, and incidentally, many of them graduated from Al Aqsa University which was fully established as a higher institution in 2000 and before that was a college and a teachers’ training college in\n1955.\nThe names include\nAyoub Abu Lebda, a marketing professional from the Al Aqsa University. He was killed together with his family – wife and children – brothers and sisters and parents in an Israeli strike on the Al-Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza.\nAnd then there is\nNesma Abu Shaira, a visual artist and a lecturer at the Al Aqsa University, killed by an Israeli strike on Gaza city. She loved her work at the Department of Fine Art and Graphic Design and was very proud of her students.\nAnd then there is Saleem Al-Naffar, a well-known Palestinian poet, who was killed by an Israeli strike on Gaza. The list of deaths of professionals is endless.\nPen America states this poet advocated peaceful resistance and the Palestinian struggle for survival. There were no guns in the words, nor tanks!\nVery eerie is the story of Yafa Haider Abu Baraka, a 24-year-old journalism and communications graduate also from the Al Aqsa University. Her story is so poignant because she wrote about the inevitability of her death whilst alive in the city of Khan Younis that started to experience daily Israeli bombardments, come December, 2023.\nShe wrote on the\nX platform: “My name is Yaffa…and what I am afraid of most is noting my name among the dead targeted by the occupation as a number that increases each day and is difficult to count and they will say ‘a youth was martyred among others in a Zionist targeting of a residential area’ but “I am not a number, I am 24 years old and have friends and experience much pain….Yafa is a martyr killed by the occupation…”\nThe aim of the Israeli bombing on Gaza has been to kill the national identity of Palestinian in their workplaces and at their homes but they may not succeed because of the existential nature of the fight against occupation and colonialism.\nPalestinians are alive, breathing people who long experienced Israeli onslaughts, admittedly not as vehement as this time round. But in all honesty, Gaza has always been a shooting practice range for the Israeli military.\nHalima Abdul Karim Al-Kahlout was a well-known Palestinian artist on the Gazan cultural scene. She was 28 when she was targeted with her family in Gaza city and over the years have held many art exhibitions having also graduated from Al Aqsa University.\nAs a full-time employee of the Ministry of Culture in Gaza, she sought to direct and inspire young artists who had a tendency to paint and become part of the cultural scene in the enclave.\nThose killed are just a few of the professional sector of men and women who have been murdered over the past three months of the war on Gaza. The aim has been to decimate Palestinian society with their bombardment from the air. But they are not succeeding despite the murder of 100 journalists deliberately made to muzzle the word.",

    "text": "Un calme étrange règne sur Dacca, la capitale du Bangladesh, en cette matinée du 5 août 2024. Des véhicules militaires et de police stationnent aux grands carrefours de la mégapole, dont des camions bloquent les principaux points d’entrée : il s’agit d’empêcher l’afflux des participants à la « longue marche vers Dacca » lancée par le mouvement populaire qui secoue le pays depuis trois semaines. La coupure d’Internet décrétée par le pouvoir ayant été levée une semaine auparavant, les réseaux sociaux bruissent de spéculations quant à la suite des événements depuis que le chef d’état-major de l’armée, le général Waker-uz-Zaman, a annoncé qu’il s’adresserait à la nation pour répondre à la demande de démission de Mme Sheikh Hasina, première ministre depuis 2009. Quand le général prend enfin la parole à 16 heures, la rumeur selon laquelle Mme Hasina a quitté le pays s’est déjà répandue comme une traînée de poudre. Barré de lunettes noires, le visage du haut gradé trahit sa fébrilité face aux caméras et, derrière leurs objectifs, à une nation qui retient son souffle. L’homme confirme la fuite de la cheffe du gouvernement. Deux heures auparavant, celle-ci s’est engouffrée dans un hélicoptère militaire à destination de l’Inde. Dans les rues la population exulte, alors qu’une foule en liesse fait irruption dans le Ganabhaban, la résidence officielle de Mme Hasina. Les uns s’emparent de ses saris, les autres des cygnes qui peuplent le lac du palais, cependant que les plus facétieux se photographient allongés sur le lit somptueux de la fuyarde. À la télévision, le général poursuit son allocution en appelant au calme et à la retenue. Il promet une réunion avec les principaux dirigeants des partis d’opposition dès le lendemain. Une unique question à l’ordre du jour — celle-là même que personne n’avait osé poser depuis quinze ans : qui, désormais, pour diriger le pays ? Ainsi prit fin le « juillet sanglant » bangladais. Un mois marqué par une répression brutale, de multiples disparitions forcées menées par les services de (...)

    "title": "Evacuees from Ruidoso area fires recount panic, express gratitude",
    "text": "CAPITAN — Martha and Ron Muñez moved from Dallas to a home in Alto three weeks ago, with the intention of retiring in the peaceful rural community north of Ruidoso. Then, Monday afternoon, Martha texted her husband — who had temporarily returned to Texas — photos of a towering plume of smoke approaching their home. He told her to leave immediately. Neighbors Martha barely knew drove her to a house outside of areas evacuated from the South Fork and Salt fires to shelter. Despite widespread outages of cell service and internet, the couple managed to reunite within a a few days. “They cut off the power and internet so nobody could get a hold of anybody. I didn’t know where she was; I was freaking out. We finally met, we were crying like we were babies,” Ron recounted Friday from the Inn of the Mountain Gods, a hotel still in business just south of Ruidoso, with cots set up in a conference room for evacuees. Martha Muñez volunteered to help hotel staff dole out provisions to other evacuees to keep her mind off “everything and anything,” including what the couple will do if they return to find only ashes. “She was upset because she said, ‘I should’ve brought my jewelry. I should’ve brought your guns. I didn’t even lock the door,’ ” Ron described. “I said, ‘You didn’t have time,’ ” he continued, reassuring his wife Friday as her eyes filled with tears: “We’re good. We’re good. You’re alive.” The Muñezes’ experience reflected that of many of the approximately 8,000 people evacuated from Ruidoso and surrounding areas after the South Fork and Salt fires ignited Monday amid conditions ripe for them to rapidly spread. People sheltering at Red Cross and other evacuation centers Friday described quick, chaotic evacuations from their homes, followed by panicked efforts to locate friends and family during communications blackouts. Many emphasized their gratitude for assistance from people near and far as they grappled with continued uncertainty about what has been lost in fires and floods. ‘It’s going to be hard to recover’ At Capitan High School on Friday, several Red Cross volunteers helped about 150 people access food, clothes, medical care and free Wi-Fi or register to sleep on a cot for the night. On papers tacked to the wall, people scribbled messages such as “Jamie Estes, call Donna.” Many people arrived in a panic, said Red Cross volunteer David Bourne. “We’ll wait here, maybe 10 days,” said Jesus Hernandez, an Alto resident evacuated to the shelter Monday. Hernandez was working at Ruidoso Downs Race Track when he received orders to evacuate. “[I have] nothing: Only my shirt, my shorts and my sandals,” he said, pointing. Robert Cathey, 71 years old and a 27-year resident of Ruidoso, was also anxious to return home as a steady rain fell over the Capitan evacuation center Friday. Fire maps suggest his house has not burned but “it’s kind of in a flood zone,” he said. “They’ve run me out, and I can’t get back,” Cathey said, referring to roadblocks at seemingly every access point into the evacuation zones. “I left so much behind I should have taken with me” — including medications — “but I didn’t know it was going to be this long,” Cathey continued. “People left everything behind. I know that's a stupid thing to leave behind, but …” he joked with a small smile. Though wildfires have burned somewhere in the area “nearly every year,” the recent evacuations have been by far the worst in his experience, Cathey added. Many friends and neighbors could not get their homes insured against fire for that reason, he said, so “it’s going to be hard to recover.” ‘You’re going to be shocked’ The main streets of Ruidoso were mostly spared from fire, said Todd Oberheu, who has returned a few times as administrator of the Lincoln County Medical Center, a Ruidoso hospital evacuated due to the fires. “Honestly, if you come into town and drive where most of the tourists go, until you get more up here to the north, you won’t even know there was any fire,” Oberheu said. “But it did get close, because let me tell you, Monday night was pretty harrowing.” Surrounding town, the fires burned about 1,400 structures, state and local officials reported, including hundreds of homes and the Swiss Chalet Hotel. “I think you’re going to be shocked [and] awed when you come into the community,” Ruidoso Mayor Lynn Crawford said in a video posted to Facebook on Friday night. He announced in the video, to praise from many commenters, the village will open to full-time residents Monday morning despite continued risks. “I called an emergency meeting today because we’ve had many discussions about, are we doing the right thing [evacuating the village]? Are we protecting our citizens, or are we being Big Brother?” Crawford said. “We had to think, ‘What do we truly believe?’ and [for] myself that was, civil liberties, that you are adults, this is your property,” Crawford continued. “The main thing is that, if you’re going to come in, you need to be responsible. … With liberties comes responsibility, so that’s what we’re asking of you.” Anyone returning will need to bring food and water and be prepared for smoke and possible floods, he said. “The fire danger seems to be out of the way,\" Crawford said. \"Catastrophic floods haven’t happened yet, it’s just a matter of when, and that is going to be an issue, but that’s going to be on you to protect yourselves [and] to be aware of what’s going on.” Search and rescue teams with cadaver dogs will still be looking for missing people in burn areas, Crawford added. ‘We’ll just hang in there together’ Aid workers expect their efforts to continue for over a month until the area can get “anywhere back to a kind of normalcy,” Inn of the Mountain Gods spokeswoman Sarah Kazhe said Friday, as volunteers cleared room for truckloads of donations. “But if there’s one thing I know, the people in the area of Mescalero, Ruidoso are resilient,” Kazhe said. “We’ve had things — never like this before — but definitely had [disasters] happen before.” After touring evacuated areas Saturday, U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich said in a statement he was “floored” by families’ resilience. “Not only did we see the heart-wrenching destruction these fires have caused, we saw a community in action,” Sen. Ben Ray Luján added in the joint statement. “New Mexicans are opening up their doors and lending a hand to those in their darkest moments.” Melody Rainer, a resident of Capitan, said she’d walked to the nearby Red Cross shelter Thursday to invite two families with dogs to stay with her. “You know, we had two homes burn down when I was a kid. I’ll never forget what it's like to not have anything, and so my heart bleeds for a lot of these people,” Rainer said. “If there’s a square inch of terrain on my property, anybody’s welcome,” she said. “We’ll just hang in there together; we’ll all take care of each other.”",

    "text": "Gavin Newsom spent over a year positioning himself as a potential successor Newsom has been relegated to doing interviews as a surrogate for Harris READ MORE: Democrats hope Gavin Newsom can replace Biden - but do they know about the sleazy California Governor&#039;s infidelities, addiction, TEENAGE lover... and why allies say he &#039;doesn&#039;t have real friends&#039;? With Kamala Harris set to accept the Democrat nomination for president Thursday night, many wonder what happened to the other California liberal many thought may take Joe Biden&#039;s place. Gavin Newsom, the two-term governor of the Golden State, spent over a year positioning himself as a potential successor to Biden, even posturing enough to go through with a debate against Ron DeSantis on Fox News. Instead, this week, Newsom has been relegated to doing interviews as a surrogate and announcing the nomination of Harris on behalf of his state&#039;s delegates. Newsom has not even had a devoted speaking slot at a convention that&#039;s included everyone from Oprah Winfrey to Ana Navarro. However, those close to him suggest that there&#039;s still a bright future ahead for the governor, despite being term-limited out and two younger Democrats holding the state&#039;s US Senate seats. With Kamala Harris set to accept the Democrat nomination for president Thursday night, many wonder what happened to Gavin Newsom (pictured left), the other California liberal many thought may take Joe Biden&#039;s place Newsom has been relegated to doing interviews as a surrogate and announcing the nomination of Harris on behalf of his state&#039;s delegates &#039;Ridiculous,&#039; Newsom spokesman Nathan Click told the Sacramento Bee if his boss&#039; star had dimmed. &#039;He&#039;s excited about the ticket and he&#039;s gonna be hitting the road just like he&#039;s been doing before. He&#039;s focused on defeating Donald Trump in 2024.&#039; Newsom and Vice President Kamala Harris both rose to political power coming through the San Francisco Bay Area. His public turn began in 2022, when he started to slam the Democrats for being soft on their own agenda. &#039;Where is the Democratic Party? Why aren&#039;t we standing up more firmly? More resolutely? Why aren&#039;t we calling this out?&#039; He seemed to set himself up to be the Democrat Party&#039;s spokesperson, launching a super PAC called Campaign For Democracy and touring deep red states. The run culminated in the December 2023 debate with his Floridian counterpart DeSantis, who pointed to his hypocrisy during COVID-19 by going out to fine-dining restaurant The French Laundry and sending his children to in-person private schools while his residents were still under lockdown. He said California ran out of UHauls because so many people were moving out to head to red states – including Florida. He said among the new residents in Florida is Newsom&#039;s wife&#039;s father. Biden made one of his last public speeches Monday night. After dropping out, many suggested Newsom wanted the job Newsom and Vice President Kamala Harris both rose to political power coming through the San Francisco Bay Area Newsom didn&#039;t back down in the one-on-one debate in Alpharetta, Georgia, taking a dig at DeSantis by saying they both won&#039;t be presidential nominees in 2024. &#039;You almost have to try to mess California up,&#039; DeSantis said during feisty opening remarks explaining why his state is superior. &#039;That is what Gavin Newsom has done since he has been governor.&#039; Newsom initially challenged DeSantis to a debate in September 2022. At the time, DeSantis was not yet running in the 2024 Republican presidential primary. The governor&#039;s profile made him the center of headlines after Joe Biden&#039;s debate disaster, with many suggesting he might win an open primary against Harris. But Newsom immediately headed to New Hampshire to canvas for Joe Biden, which won&#039;t stop those speculating he&#039;d replace the president on the ticket. Newsom, despite speculation, adamantly said that he &#039;will never turn my back on President Biden&#039; and promised he was not running a secret campaign. &#039;I don&#039;t know a Democrat in my party that would do so. And especially after tonight, we have his back,&#039; he said. He did his best to instead reassure Americans that the president is still capable. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (left) and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (right) met for a one-on-one debate hosted by Fox News and moderated by Sean Hannity (center) in December in Alpharetta, Georgia &#039;I spent a lot of time with him. I know Joe Biden. I know what he&#039;s accomplished in the last three and a half years. I know what he&#039;s capable of. And I have no trepidations.&#039; Newsom, 56, told DailyMail.com that claims that he could replace Biden, 81, in November were &#039;farcical.&#039; He apparently proved his own claim correct, when he almost immediately endorsed Harris upon her declaring her intention to run. &#039;Tough. Fearless. Tenacious. With our democracy at stake and our future on the line, no one is better to prosecute the case against Donald Trump&#039;s dark vision and guide our country in a healthier direction than America’s Vice President,&#039; Newsom posted on X hours after Biden dropped out. Newsom&#039;s endorsement of Harris furthers the two&#039;s long interwoven political careers and shows a solidarity between the two. He also confirmed earlier this month that he would not challenge Harris for the presidency in 2024 - a commitment he made long ago - saying &#039;of course&#039; he would not run against her. On Thursday night, Newsom&#039;s seeming only major appearance again came on Fox News, with his fellow Californian set to have the biggest night of her political life. Read more",

    "text": "点击右上角微信好友\n朋友圈\n请使用浏览器分享功能进行分享\n光明日报长春3月12日电（记者任爽 通讯员芦猛）记者日前从吉林大学获悉，在中国第41次南极考察期间，吉林大学、中国地质大学（北京）联合俄罗斯海洋与地质矿产资源研究所组成的联合科研小组，在东南极拉斯曼丘陵地区首次利用已有钻孔开展测井作业，获取了钻孔的温度、倾角、方位角以及钻孔直径变化等关键参数，得到了完整的冰川内部温度剖面，为揭示未来气候变化背景下南极冰盖的演化规律提供了重要依据。\n此前，在中国第40次南极考察期间，该联合科研小组利用吉林大学自主研发的新型铠装电缆悬吊式电动机械深冰及冰下基岩取芯钻探系统在中山站以南约25公里处，成功钻穿545米厚的冰层和冰岩夹层，获取了连续冰芯样品和基岩样品，并形成冰下基岩二号孔。\n此次是该联合科研小组的再次合作。科研人员利用吉林大学建设工程学院、极地科学与工程研究院自主研发的极地冰孔测井成套探测装备和钻井液回收设备，在冰下基岩二号孔开展南极冰盖测井作业。\n历时2个月，科研人员获取了完整的冰川内部温度剖面，并测量了钻孔倾角和方位角，对钻孔缩径过程及冰川运动演化开展了持续观测，获取了重要的原位冰川运动参数，为探明伊丽莎白公主地末端冰盖底部地热通量及其动力学演化机制奠定了基础。\n据悉，拉斯曼丘陵地区位于伊丽莎白公主地冰盖末端，是东南极冰盖重要的溢流区之一。冰下地质环境是影响冰盖运动的重要因素，探明拉斯曼丘陵地区冰下地质环境对揭示伊丽莎白公主地末端冰盖的动力学演化机制和物质平衡特征具有重要意义。\n《光明日报》（2025年03月13日 08版）",
