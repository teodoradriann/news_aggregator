    "text": "Usar estes utensílios na cozinha pode aumentar o risco de câncer em 300%\nNa cozinha, é comum ver utensílios pretos, como colheres e espátulas, feitos de plástico — mas aqui está um motivo para não usá-los\nAnne Silva, Fórum\nUm estudo conduzido pela Toxic-Free Future, uma organização de pesquisa independente, em conjunto ao Instituto de Amsterdam pela Vida e o Meio Ambiente, e publicada na revista Chemosphere revelou que utensílios plásticos da cor preta são especialmente preocupantes para a saúde.\nIsso porque esses produtos podem conter até 22.800 partes por milhão de retardadores de chama, substâncias químicas usadas em materiais (em especial plásticos, tecidos e eletrônicos) para reduzir sua inflamabilidade e retardar a propagação de chamas em caso de incêndio.\nOs retardadores, que podem ser de vários tipos, geralmente liberam compostos fortemente ligados ao risco de câncer, ao desenvolvimento de problemas endócrinos, à neurotoxicidade e a problemas reprodutivos e de desenvolvimento.\nOs plásticos pretos costumam ser contaminados com esses produtos e suas substâncias durante o processo de reciclagem do lixo eletrônico, de acordo com o estudo, de autoria principal de Megan Liu, gerente de ciência e política do instituto Toxic-Free Future.\nNos eletrônicos, esses retardadores são mais utilizados; quando são levados a centros de reciclagem, e durante o processo de transformação, eles acabam contaminando o plástico com substâncias retardadoras de alto potencial cancerígeno.\nUm desses produtos, o éter decabromodifenílico, encontrado pela pesquisa em altas quantidades em uma bandeja de sushi de plástico preto, pode elevar as chances de câncer em até 300%.\nAcompanhe Pragmatismo Político no Instagram, Twitter e no Facebook\nNos EUA, o decaBDE foi banido em 2021 pela Agência de Proteção Ambiental; na União Europeia, há restrições de limite dessa substância, embora amostras revelem que ela é geralmente encontrada em maiores quantidades do que o permitido.\nNa cozinha, é comum ver utensílios pretos, como colheres e espátulas, feitos de plástico — diariamente, o uso desses equipamentos pode expor uma pessoa a até 34,7 partes por milhão da substância retardadora; com o tempo, essa exposição tende a se tornar cada vez mais danosa ao organismo.\nO plástico preto foi associado às condições da pesquisa porque só objetos dessa cor foram testados, informa a pesquisadora principal, Liu. Não se pode determinar, portanto, se outras cores também são afetadas.\nEm outros países — a pesquisa de Liu foi realizada na Alemanha —, as amostras de plástico preto também indicaram a presença de substâncias tóxicas, e mais: os retardadores podem passar dos utensílios de cozinha para os alimentos e para a saliva.\n→ SE VOCÊ CHEGOU ATÉ AQUI… Saiba que o Pragmatismo não tem investidores e não está entre os veículos que recebem publicidade estatal do governo.

    "text": "Cher has filed for temporary legal conservatorship of her adult son Elijah Blue Allman, citing his alleged ongoing substance abuse issues.\nAccording to a petition filed this week in Los Angeles Superior Court and obtained by CNN, Cher is seeking to be the sole conservator of her son’s estate, alleging that he “is currently unable to manage his assets due to severe mental health and substance abuse issues.”\n“Elijah is entitled to regular distributions from the Trust, but given his ongoing mental health and substance abuse issues,” according to the documents. “Petitioner (Cher) is concerned that any funds distributed to Elijah will be immediately spent on drugs, leaving Elijah with no assets to provide for himself and putting Elijah’s life at risk.”\nThe 47-year-old is the son of Cher and her former husband, the late rocker Gregg Allman.\nPeople are also reading…\nGregg Allman and Cher were married from 1975 to 1979. He\ndied in 2017 at the age of 69 due to liver cancer complications.\nThe petition filed by Cher states that her son is set to receive funds from a trust by the end of the year. It also states that the 77-year-old singer and actress has “worked tirelessly to get Elijah into treatment and get him the help he needs.”\n“Petitioner (Cher) loves Elijah immensely and has always acted with his best interests in mind,” the filing states.\n“I’m not suffering from any problem that millions of people in the United States aren’t,”\nCher told People magazine in October, referring to her son’s substance abuse.\n“I’m a mother. This is my job — one way or another, to try to help my children,” she said. “You do anything for your children. Whenever you can help them, you just do it because that’s what being a mother is. But it’s joy, even with heartache — mostly, when you think of your children, you just smile and you love them, and you try to be there for them.”\nCher is also the mother of Chaz Bono.\nA hearing has been scheduled in March, according to court documents. CNN is working to determine if Allman has legal representation.\nCNN has reached out to representatives for Cher for further comment.",

    "text": "Snow covered M9 motorway during Storm Bert – Photo Robert Perry/PA Wire Large parts of the country will face disruption from heavy snow and freezing rain over the weekend after forecasters issued two amber weather warnings.\nStranded vehicles on the roads, delayed or cancelled rail and air travel and power cuts are all likely as the UK grapples with a week-long spell of wintry conditions, the Met Office said.\nThere is also a “good chance” that rural communities could be cut off due to the conditions, with up to 30cm of snowfall expected locally.\nIt comes after initial data indicated Rostherne in Cheshire and Yeovilton in Somerset saw temperatures drop to minus 5C overnight into Friday, just shy of previous estimates which suggested the mercury could dip as low as minus 8C.\nTemperatures of minus 10C could be seen in parts of rural Scotland on Friday night, according to new Met Office forecasts.\nThe coldest temperature recorded in January last year was minus 14C, in Dalwhinnie in the Highlands.\nAmber warning\nAn amber warning for snow and freezing rain covering most of Wales and central England, including the Midlands and the north-west cities of Liverpool and Manchester, is in place from 6pm on Saturday to midday on Sunday, the Met Office said.\nThe second warning for snow, covering most of northern England including Leeds, Sheffield and the Lake District, has been issued from 9pm on Saturday to midnight on Sunday.\nBoth of the warning areas can expect to see 3cm to 7cm of snowfall widely, while snow may mix with rain at times in lower-lying areas, the forecaster said.\nThree separate yellow weather warnings for snow and ice are already in place for most areas of the UK, covering different periods of time from Friday to Monday afternoon.\nMet Office chief forecaster Jason Kelly said some “significant accumulations” of snow are possible in parts of Wales, the Midlands and northern England, and the additional factor of strengthening winds could lead to drifting of lying snow.\nHe continued: “There is a risk of freezing rain across parts of the Midlands and northern England, but especially Wales, adding to the risk of ice and leading to some treacherous conditions in places.\n“As the super-cooled rain droplets hit the surface they instantly freeze, covering everything in a layer of ice, making it extremely dangerous.”\nAdvice\nNational Highways advised those planning to travel over the weekend to check their vehicles, keep their distance on the roads and pack a “snow kit” of blankets, food, water and a shovel.\nUK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) cold weather health alerts for all of England remain in place ahead of a week of low temperatures.\nAmber alerts were issued on Thursday and will run until January 8, meaning a rise in deaths is likely, the agency said.\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: “The forecasted temperatures can have a serious impact on the health of some people, including those aged 65 and over and those with pre-existing health conditions, and it is therefore vital to check in on friends, family and neighbours that are most vulnerable.\n“These people could be more at risk of heart attacks, stroke and chest infections as a result of cold temperatures.”\nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting said on Friday it is “a weekend to layer up and put the heating on” due to the cold conditions.\nHe told BBC Breakfast: “We are heading into a cold snap this weekend and I know there are lots of concerns, not just amongst charity leaders, but also among NHS and social care leaders as well, about the particular risks and vulnerabilities this weekend as temperatures drop, both in terms of risk of accident and injury, but also risk from the cold itself.\n“This is a weekend to wrap up and keep warm, to take sensible precautions about going out and about.”\nCouncils across London and southern England have activated emergency measures including additional accommodation to help rough sleepers stay safe during the cold snap.\nJames Lally, services director of homelessness charity St Mungo’s, said: “Access to a safe and warm place to live is vital for those experiencing homelessness all year round – and during freezing cold weather, emergency accommodation saves lives.\n“St Mungo’s frontline teams are prepared to respond to this critical situation, and continue to work tirelessly around the clock to make sure that as many people as possible can be brought out of the cold and into safety.”",

    "text": "أكد الرئيس الإيراني مسعود بزشكيان أن أساس المحادثات مع أميركا هو توجيهات قائد الثورة الإسلامية، وأن إيران لن تخضع للقوة، في حين قال قائد الحرس الثوري الإيراني اللواء حسين سلامي إن طهران جاهزة ومستعدة لأي حروب على أي مستويات.\nونقلت وكالة \"تسنيم\" الدولية للأنباء، اليوم الخميس، عن بزشكيان قوله: \"لن نقبل أبدا أن نخفض أبحاثنا إلى الصفر، ثم ننتظر موافقتهم للحصول على المواد النووية اللازمة للصناعة والطب والزراعة وغيرها من العلوم\".\nوتابع قائلا في تصريحات له مساء أمس الأربعاء: \"من قال إنه لا ينبغي السماح لنا بإجراء البحوث العلمية؟ ماذا يفعلون ليأمرونا بتفكيك صناعتنا النووية بالكامل\".\nوأكد: \"لن نتهاون أبدا.. لقد أكد سماحة قائد الثورة الإسلامية أننا لن نصنع قنبلة نووية، وهذه هي سياستنا الحاسمة\".\nوتأتي تصريحات الرئيس الإيراني بعد تصريحات للرئيس الأميركي دونالد ترامب قال فيها إن بلاده لن تسمح لإيران بامتلاك سلاح نووي \"على الإطلاق\".\nتوتر متصاعد بين الولايات المتحدة وإيران (شترستوك) حرب شاملة\nوردا على التهديدات الأميركية بالتحرك عسكريا إذا فشلت المفاوضات بشأن البرنامج النووي الإيراني، قال قائد الحرس الثوري الإيراني: \"نعيش منذ سنوات في قلب حرب شاملة، ونواجه على المستوى الاقتصادي حربا عالمية\"، مشيرا إلى أن العدو يسعى دائما لإغلاق جميع الأبواب أمام بلاده وقام بتخطيط وتنفيذ أكبر الحروب ضدها.",
