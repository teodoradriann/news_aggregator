    "text": "Amid the hustle and bustle of the grand festival of Lok Sabha elections, the news of the demise of Srimat Swami Smaranananda ji Maharaj brought my mind to a standstill for a few moments. Srimat Swami Smaranananda ji Maharaj was a pioneer of India’s spiritual consciousness and his demise is like a personal loss. A few years ago, the demise of Swami Atmasthananda ji and now the departure of Swami Smaranananda ji on his eternal journey has left many people bereaved. My heart, like that of crores of devotees, saints and followers of Ramakrishna Math and Mission, is deeply saddened. During my visit to Kolkata earlier this month, I had gone to the hospital to enquire about Swami Smaranananda Ji’s health. Just like Swami Atmasthananda ji, Swami Smaranananda ji too dedicated his entire life to spreading the ideas of Acharya Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Mata Sharada Devi and Swami Vivekananda across the world. While writing this article, the memories of meetings and conversations with him are getting refreshed in my mind.In January 2020, during my stay at Belur Math, I meditated in the room of Swami Vivekananda. During that visit, I had a long conversation about Swami Atmasthananda ji with Swami Smaranananda ji.It is widely known that I had a close relationship with Ramakrishna Mission and Belur Math. As a seeker of spirituality, I have met different saints and mahatmas and been to many places over a period of more than five decades. Even in Ramakrishna Math, I got to know about the saints who dedicated their lives to spirituality, among whom personalities like Swami Atmasthananda ji and Swami Smaranananda ji were prominent. Their sacred thoughts and knowledge provided contentment to my mind. In the most important period of my life, such saints taught me the true principle of “jan seva hi prabhu seva”.The lives of Swami Atmasthananda ji and Swami Smaranananda ji are an indelible example of the motto of Ramakrishna Mission “Atmano Mokshaartham Jagaddhitaaya Cha”.We all are inspired by the work being done by Ramakrishna Mission for the promotion of education and rural development. Ramakrishna Mission is working on India’s spiritual enlightenment, educational empowerment and humanitarian service. In 1978, when the disastrous flood struck Bengal, Ramakrishna Mission won the hearts of everyone with its selfless service. I remember, when an earthquake ravaged Kutch in 2001, Swami Atmasthananda ji was among the first people to call me and offer all possible assistance for disaster management on behalf of the Ramakrishna Mission. Under his direction, Ramakrishna Mission helped many people who were affected by the earthquake.Over the past years, while holding various positions, Swami Atmasthananda ji and Swami Smaranananda ji laid great emphasis on social empowerment. Those who know the lives of these great personalities will definitely remember how serious these saints were towards modern education, skilling and women empowerment.Among his many inspiring traits, one thing that impressed me the most was Swami Atmasthananda ji’s love and respect for every culture and every tradition. The reason for this was that he used to travel continuously and had spent a long time in different parts of India. He learned to speak Gujarati while living in Gujarat. He used to even speak with me in the language and I loved listening to his Gujarati!At different points in India’s development journey, our motherland has been blessed by many saints and seers like Swami Atmasthananda ji and Swami Smaranananda ji who have ignited the spark of societal change. They have motivated us to work with a collective spirit and address all the challenges our society faces. These principles are eternal and will act as our source of strength as we embark on developing a Viksit Bharat during the Amrit Kaal.Once again, on behalf of the entire nation, I pay homage to such saintly souls. I am confident that all the people associated with the Ramakrishna Mission will further move ahead on the path shown by them.Om Shanti.",

    "title": "Tradie&apos;s melanoma warning: Sun safety for outdoor workers",
    "text": "This is branded content for the Cancer Council and the Australian Government Six months ago, Newcastle builder Paul Smart experienced the unnerving wait to find out if a skin cancer growing on his neck was a melanoma. The 43-year-old father of three young children said the period between having a biopsy taken and getting the result was a \"scary\" time. \"When you hear those words from the doctor, &apos;This doesn&apos;t look great&apos;, you really start to think, well, what if it&apos;s something that&apos;s bad,\" he said. \"It was the first time it had happened to me and it was a shock.\" Fortunately, the news was good for the owner of Smartview Building and his family. But the five-centimetre football-shaped scar behind his ear where the cancer was removed now serves as a small reminder of the reality of skin cancer and the importance of being vigilant about sun protection. \"It was a real reality check,\" said Mr Smart, who started in his career as a 17-year-old. \"Despite having pretty good habits around sun protection it was a reminder not to get complacent. Since I was a kid I&apos;ve been aware of the dangers of skin cancer and we made sure we wore the sunscreen and hats, so it was a surprise. But growing up [in Newcastle and Lake Macquarie] I spent a lot of time outdoors, playing sport and at the beach. And I&apos;ve worked outside a lot on site because of what I do.\" As one of the most at-risk groups when it comes to skin cancer, tradies are a key target of the latest national skin cancer prevention campaign from the Cancer Council and the Australian Government. Australian men in general are more than twice as likely as women to die of melanoma, but tradies are especially vulnerable because of the nature of their work. Across all Australian men, research shows that while they spend more time outdoors than women at peak UV times they are significantly less likely to be in the habit of protecting their skin from the sun. This in a country that leads the world when it comes to the rate of skin cancer. In 2024 there were an estimated 18,964 cases of melanoma of the skin and 1664 cases of non-melanoma skin cancer diagnosed, with more than one million non-melanoma skin cancers treated. Around 1384 people lost their lives to melanoma. Up to 95 per cent of melanomas are caused by overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation - the invisible killer that you can&apos;t feel or see. UV can be high even on cool and overcast days. Spending time outdoors unprotected when the UV radiation is three or above increases the risk of developing the potentially deadly cancer. Cancer Council Australia Chief Executive Officer Mark Nevin urged all men and particularly outdoor workers like tradies to follow the Cancer Council&apos;s guidelines and get into the habit of protecting themselves daily from this almost entirely preventable disease. Up to 80 per cent of skin cancers are preventable by using the Cancer Council&apos;s five Sunsmart steps - Slip, Slop, Slap, Seek and Slide. \"Tradies take safety seriously on site, but we know sun protection often isn&apos;t a priority,\" Mr Nevin said. \"Two in three of us will be diagnosed with skin cancer in our lifetime, and people who work outdoors are at even greater risk, with Australian men twice as likely to die from melanoma than women. \"The good news is it can be prevented, and you can reduce your risk of skin cancer at any age, by following the steps. It only takes a few minutes to slip on protective clothing, slop on SPF50 or SPF50+ water-resistant sunscreen, slap on a broad-brimmed hat, seek shade, and slide on sunglasses. \"These small behaviours can protect your skin from UV and prevent skin cancer, no matter the season.\" While the commitments of managing his business means he&apos;s no longer putting the tool belt on as often, Mr Smart is a champion of sun protection for both himself and the Smartview team. \"For me, it&apos;s just good habits that are ingrained now,\" he said. \"If I&apos;m going out in the sun and don&apos;t put sunscreen on, or a hat on, I&apos;m going to get burned and I don&apos;t want to have to deal with that now or further down the track. It&apos;s pretty easy to remember the hat because I&apos;ve got a bald head. \"I make sure to remind the guys to use sunscreen, put their hats on and keep their shirts on. I&apos;d say 90 per cent of them are good at doing it but some of the younger ones are not so good. \"They haven&apos;t built those habits yet. You do feel bulletproof when you&apos;re young.\" n estimated 200 melanomas and 34,000 other skin cancers diagnosed each year in Australia are the result of UV damage in the workplace. If you spend a lot of time outdoors it&apos;s crucial to protect your skin from the sun all year round, regardless of UV levels - even on cloudy days. To keep your skin safe from this potentially deadly cancer incorporate these five easy habits into your daily routine. Long pants and work shirts with a collar and long sleeves are best. If possible, choose clothes made from lightweight, closely woven fabrics with a UV protection factor (UPF) 50+. Apply sunscreen generously 20 minutes before you start working outdoors. Reapply every two hours, or more often if sweating or working with water to ensure your skin is protected throughout the day. To remember try setting reminders on your phone. A hat is essential if you&apos;re heading outside. Choose a broad-brimmed, legionnaire or bucket-style hat that covers your face, neck and ears. These are common spots for skin cancers to develop and can easily be forgotten. Caps are not recommended as they don&apos;t provide full protection for the face, ears and neck. Leave a suitable hat in your car or by your door so you&apos;re always prepared. Work and take breaks in the shade. Whenever possible, plan to work indoors or in the shade during the middle of the day when UV radiation levels are strongest. Remember, UV rays can reflect from surfaces, especially if you&apos;re near water, so combine shade with other protection measures. Protect your eyes from the sun when working outdoors by wearing close-fitting wrap-around sunglasses or tinted safety glasses that offer UV protection. A good pair of sunglasses, when worn with a broad-brimmed hat, can block up to 98 per cent of UV radiation from reaching your eyes. Keep a pair in your glove box or bag you use everyday so they&apos;re always nearby. The Cancer Council and the Australian Government are reminding Australians to be sun safe by using all five forms of sun protection when the UV is three or above.

    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

    "title": "Alejo Veliz celebration, Richarlison frustration - 5 things spotted in Brighton vs Tottenham - football.london",
    "text": "Tottenham's run of three successive wins came to an abrupt end at the Amex Stadium on Thursday evening as Brighton & Hove Albion ran out 4-2 winners. Second best right from the first whistle, [Spurs fell behind on 11 minutes as Jack Hinshelwood rifled the ball high into the net after finding himself in acres of space](https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/fixtures-results/brighton-vs-tottenham-live-kick-28356512). It was to then get even worse for Spurs as Dejan Kulusevski gave away a penalty for a pull on Danny Welbeck, thus allowing Joao Pedro the opportunity to net from 12 yards as he sent Guglielmo Vicario the wrong way. [Tottenham](https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/) did threaten in first-half stoppage-time but Richarlison's deflected effort struck the outside of the box as Postecoglou's men looked to reduce the deficit, with the Brazilian then having two goals chalked off for offside after the break. Falling 4-0 behind following Pervis Estupinan's stunning strike from distance and another Joao Pedro penalty, Spurs set up a tense finale following Alejo Veliz and Ben Davies goals but they unfortunately couldn't find the net once again despite fashioning a number of openings. Here are five things football.london spotted in the game on the south coast. Dier situation It just goes from bad to worse for Postecoglou on the Tottenham injury front. Already losing some key players over the course of the season and set to lose another three early next month due to the upcoming international tournaments, the Spurs boss now has to make do with [Cristian Romero](https://www.football.london/all-about/cristian-romero) for a period of time. The Argentina international sustained a hamstring strain in the first half of the win over Everton [and he will now be absent for potentially five weeks](https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/news/breaking-ange-postecoglou-delivers-cristian-28353081). As a result of his injury, Emerson Royal remained in the Spurs team but shifted over from left-back to partner Ben Davies at centre-back. [Eric Dier](https://www.football.london/all-about/eric-dier) was the man to replace Romero at the start of the second half against Everton last Saturday but he had to settle for a spot on the bench with Emerson getting the nod in the middle. Finding himself behind the Brazilian at centre-back for the recent games against Aston Villa and Man City, Postecoglou's selection very much highlighted Dier's place in his thinking. Time will tell if he is to get a reprieve for the Bournemouth game on Sunday going on the fact Tottenham shipped four at the Amex. READ MORE: [Why Oliver Skipp is absent from Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham squad vs Brighton & Hove Albion](https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/fixtures-results/oliver-skipp-absent-ange-postecoglous-28360766) READ MORE: [Tottenham to sanction January transfer as MLS move nears in windfall boost](https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/transfer-news/tottenham-sanction-january-transfer-mls-28360351) Vicario heroics On the day it was reported that [Hugo Lloris'](https://www.football.london/all-about/hugo-lloris) long association with Tottenham could be coming to an end ahead of a potential move to LAFC his successor, [Vicario](https://www.football.london/all-about/guglielmo-vicario), demonstrated why he is very much the future of the football club. Outstanding for Tottenham ever since his summer switch from Empoli, the Italian produced a fine double save in the opening couple of minutes to stop Brighton from netting. Firstly on hand to save from Welbeck after the ex-Manchester United man had put himself into a goalscoring position after some lovely play in the box, the Italian then thwarted the same player moments later. This save was even better than his first after denying the frontman from point-blank range with a reflex stop after the ball had fallen kindly to the Seagulls star. Vicario has enjoyed an incredible start to life in a Tottenham shirt and [he is very much the answer the long-term successor to Lloris](https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/transfer-news/tottenham-sanction-january-transfer-mls-28360351). Another ban incoming Tottenham really are picking up suspensions like they are going out of fashion this season. Already losing Yves Bissouma to three separate bans, Destiny Udogie to two and Romero to one, they now have another player joining the ever-growing list. The player in question is [Kulusevski](https://www.football.london/all-about/dejan-kulusevski) after he picked up his fifth yellow card of the season at the Amex. The Swede could have no complaints at all after tugging back Welbeck in the penalty box just as he looked to try and make contact with the ball. Not initially given by referee Jarred Gillett, the official halted play moments later and went to his screen to review the evidence before pointing to the spot. Kulusevski will now miss Sunday's final match of 2023 at home to Bournemouth as a result of his booking. With the cut-off point for a one-match ban for five yellow cards the 19th Premier League game of the campaign, all Kulusevski had to do to avoid the suspension was get through the Brighton match unscathed. Unfortunately he couldn't do that and now Postecoglou will have to shuffle his pack once again. Those offsides Trailing 2-0 at the break but very much still in the contest providing that they made things happen in the final third, Spurs needed a quick start to the second half to give themselves a fighting chance. Thirty-two seconds after the restart [Richarlison](https://www.football.london/all-about/richarlison) had the ball in the back of the net with a smart finish across Jason Steele but he was flagged for offside. The same was to happen again midway inside the second half as Kulusevski and Richarlison linked up and the Spurs striker slotted the ball beyond the Brighton shot-stopper. He was once again offside by a yard. The offside was extremely frustrating from a Tottenham perspective, as not long after, it was 3-0 as Estupinan found the net with a 25-yard stunner that left Vicario with no chance at all. [Had Richarlison not strayed a yard offside for his second disallowed goal](https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/news/son-heung-min-reveals-tottenham-28355744) then we could be talking about a different scoreline altogether. Veliz moment On a dismal night on the south coast for Tottenham, there was at least one positive to take from the fixture. Usually coming on in the dying minutes of matches so far this season, [Alejo Veliz](https://www.football.london/all-about/alejo-veliz) was given his most amount of playing time in one game at the Amex as he replaced Brennan Johnson with 20 minutes to go. [Keen to make a big impact in north London following his switch from his homeland in the summer](https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/players/alejo-veliz-10-tottenham-players-28349290), Veliz managed to register his first senior goal for the Lilywhites in the 81st minute as he converted from close range after Son Heung-min had squared the ball to him. Although his goal was scant consolation, you could see how much it meant to him as he punched the air in delight and clenched his fists a number of times. Despite the scoreline, his celebration was perfectly understandable as it was simply a release for scoring his maiden Tottenham goal. Veliz wasn't far off from doubling his tally in stoppage time after producing a sharp turn to get the better of the experienced Lewis Dunk but his effort on goal was unfortunately blocked by the Brighton captain. It was a good showing from the Argentine and more minutes could now be set to come his way.

    "title": "Ma belle-mère a détruit le parterre de fleurs de ma fille pendant notre absence - je lui ai donc fait payer d'une manière à laquelle elle ne s'attendait pas",
    "text": "Mon mari rendait visite à notre voisine âgée tous les jours pour l'aider dans ses tâches ménagères jusqu'à ce que je trouve des sous-vêtements féminins dans sa poche\n21 octobre 2024\nLorsque Martha revient d'un week-end, elle est horrifiée de découvrir que sa belle-mère, Gloria, a détruit le parterre de fleurs cher à sa fille et l'a remplacé par des nains de jardin de mauvais goût. Furieuse mais déterminée, Martha élabore un plan astucieux pour lui donner une leçon qu'elle n'oubliera jamais.\nMa fille Amy a été mon univers dès sa naissance. Après le départ de son père lorsqu'elle avait deux ans, nous étions seuls contre le monde jusqu'à l'arrivée de Stephen.\nUn homme souriant sur un canapé | Source : Midjourney\nIl a apporté l'amour, la stabilité et, malheureusement, sa mère Gloria dans nos vies.\nDès le jour où j'ai épousé son fils, elle a clairement exprimé sa désapprobation à mon égard et à l'égard d'Amy avec des commentaires tels que \"Tu n'as pas besoin d'une femme avec des bagages\" ou \"Pourquoi s'embêter à acheter des cadeaux pour un enfant qui n'est pas le tien ?\"\nStephen nous défendait toujours, qu'il soit béni. \"Amy est ma fille, maman\", disait-il fermement. \"Et Martha est ma femme. Cela fait d'elles des membres de la famille.\"\nUn homme qui fronce les sourcils dans une pièce sombre | Source : Midjourney\nMais Gloria se contentait d'agiter la main avec dédain, comme si elle chassait une mouche gênante.\n\"Tu devrais te concentrer sur la naissance de tes propres enfants, Stephen\", faisait-elle remarquer. \"Je veux des petits-enfants, pas des beaux-petits-enfants, ou quoi que ce soit d'autre.\"\nParfois, ces conversations devenaient houleuses, mais Stephen ne parvenait jamais à lui faire entendre raison. Et si je suggérais ne serait-ce que de nous calmer, Gloria me disait que c'était une affaire de famille et que je ne devais pas m'en mêler.\nUne femme renfrognée sur un canapé | Source : Midjourney\nCe n'était jamais facile, mais j'ai essayé de rester civilisée et de maintenir la paix pendant deux ans. Puis, Gloria a fait quelque chose d'impardonnable.\nAmy a toujours été passionnée par le jardinage. Le jour de son douzième anniversaire, Stephen et moi lui avons offert quelques plantes et réservé une parcelle pour qu'elle puisse créer son propre jardin. Elle a dit que c'était le meilleur cadeau qu'elle ait jamais reçu.\nElle a passé des mois à planifier et à construire son parterre de fleurs. Vous auriez dû voir son visage s'illuminer lorsque les premières tulipes ont fleuri.\nTulipes dans un jardin | Source : Pexels\nCe jardin n'était pas seulement de la terre et des fleurs ; c'était sa fierté et sa joie. Elle économisait son argent de poche pour acheter exactement les fleurs qu'elle voulait, en recherchant soigneusement celles qui pousseraient le mieux dans notre climat.\n\"Maman, regarde !\", s'exclamait-elle chaque matin, m'entraînant dehors pour voir les nouvelles pousses. \"Les jonquilles commencent à pousser !\"\nElle connaissait le nom de chaque fleur. Elle pouvait vous dire exactement quand elles allaient fleurir et quel genre de soins elles nécessitaient.\nUne adolescente enthousiaste | Source : Midjourney\nCertains enfants de son âge étaient obsédés par les jeux vidéo ou les réseaux sociaux, mais mon Amy trouvait sa joie dans le simple miracle de regarder les choses pousser.\nQuand elle a montré le jardin à Gloria, celle-ci a toisé les fleurs d'Amy de haut en bas et a reniflé.\n\"Je suppose que ça te convient de creuser dans la terre\", a-t-elle dit avant de rentrer rapidement à l'intérieur.\nAmy a froncé les sourcils. \"Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire, maman ?\"\nUne adolescente au froncement de sourcils | Source : Midjourney\nJe me suis forcée à sourire. \"Je pense qu'elle veut dire qu'elle peut voir à quel point le jardinage te donne de la joie, ma chérie.\"\nAmy n'avait pas l'air totalement convaincue, mais elle a haussé les épaules et a continué à pailler son jardin. Je lui ai fait un clin d'œil et j'ai suivi Gloria à l'intérieur.\nGloria avait proposé de s'occuper de notre chien pendant notre absence pour le week-end et je devais lui montrer où nous gardions sa nourriture, et espérer résister à l'envie de lui dire ce que je pensais.\nUne femme marchant à l'intérieur | Source : Midjourney\nLe week-end a été parfait. Amy a ramassé de jolis cailloux, Stephen a fait griller des guimauves et j'ai oublié Gloria.\nNous avons parcouru des sentiers entourés de fleurs sauvages et Amy a identifié chacune d'entre elles, énumérant des faits sur leur mode de croissance et les conditions qu'elles préfèrent. Elle a même pris des notes dans son petit journal, planifiant ce qu'elle pourrait ajouter à son parterre de fleurs à la maison.\nSur le chemin du retour, nous avons déposé Amy chez ma mère pour qu'elle passe un peu de temps avec sa grand-mère. Pour cette seule raison, elle n'a pas eu à voir ce que Gloria avait fait à son jardin.\nGros plan sur une femme choquée | Source : Midjourney\nMon estomac s'est retourné quand j'ai vu notre jardin. La belle plate-bande d'Amy avait disparu, remplacée par une armée de nains de jardin les plus laids que j'aie jamais vus.\nIls me souriaient avec leurs visages effrayants en céramique, se moquant de tout ce pour quoi ma fille avait travaillé. Le sol avait été complètement nettoyé, les fleurs soigneusement arrangées par Amy jetées de côté comme de la mauvaise herbe.\nMême les pierres peintes à la main qu'elle avait utilisées pour border le lit avaient disparu.\nPierres peintes à la main | Source : Pexels\nJe suis entrée en trombe dans la maison, Stephen sur mes talons.\n\"Gloria !\", ai-je crié, en m'efforçant de garder une voix stable. \"Qu'as-tu fait à la plate-bande d'Amy ?\"\nElle est apparue dans le hall, arborant son sourire suffisant familier, ses cheveux parfaitement coiffés brillant au soleil de l'après-midi.\n\"Oh, Martha ! Tu n'aimes pas les gnomes ? Les fleurs n'éclosent qu'en été, et j'ai pensé que le jardin avait besoin de décorations tout au long de l'année.\"\nUne femme dans un couloir | Source : Midjourney\n\"C'était le parterre d'Amy, maman ! Comment as-tu pu lui faire ça ?\" Stephen s'est emporté.\nGloria a soufflé et s'est pincé les lèvres. Je savais alors que ni Stephen ni moi ne parviendrions à la convaincre. Non, Gloria avait besoin d'apprendre sa leçon à la dure, et j'étais justement la personne qui devait la lui apprendre.\nJ'ai posé une main sur le bras de Stephen. Il s'est tourné vers moi, haussant un sourcil. J'ai hoché la tête, indiquant qu'il devait me laisser faire.\nUn homme dans un couloir qui regarde quelqu'un | Source : Midjourney\nJ'ai forcé mon visage à afficher un sourire doux, bien que ma mâchoire soit douloureuse à cause de l'effort. \"Tu as tout à fait raison, Gloria. Les gnomes sont adorables. Il faut que tu me dises combien nous te devons pour eux.\"\nCela l'a complètement prise au dépourvu. Elle est restée un instant bouche bée, puis a eu un sourire en coin.\n\"Oui, eh bien, ils sont peints à la main, alors ils ont coûté assez cher. 500 dollars en fait.\"\nC'était la chose la plus scandaleuse que j'avais jamais entendue, mais j'ai réussi à garder mon sourire en place. \"Réglons ça demain. Rejoins-nous pour le dîner et je te paierai à ce moment-là.\"\nUne femme qui sourit dans un couloir | Source : Midjourney\nGloria a accepté de se joindre à nous pour le dîner et est sortie de la maison avec un tel air de suffisance que j'avais du mal à le supporter.\n\"Qu'est-ce que tu prépares, Martha ?\", a demandé Stephen.\n\"Une leçon que Gloria n'oubliera jamais. Je suis désolée d'en arriver là, chéri, mais...\"\nStephen a soupiré. \"Je sais que... Fais ce que tu penses être juste, mon amour. Je te soutiens.\"\nUn homme regarde par-dessus son épaule tout en parlant | Source : Midjourney\nJ'ai passé la soirée à calculer le coût de tout ce que Gloria avait détruit : les rosiers patrimoniaux, les bulbes de tulipes spécialisés et le compost biologique.\nJ'ai inclus chaque article qu'Amy avait soigneusement sélectionné au fil des mois, plus le coût de l'analyse professionnelle du sol puisque Gloria avait probablement tout contaminé avec le produit chimique qu'elle avait utilisé pour nettoyer le lit. Le total s'élevait à mille cinq cents dollars.\nLe lendemain soir, Gloria est entrée dans notre salle à manger comme un paon.\nUne femme au sourire victorieux | Source : Midjourney\nJe l'ai accueillie avec mon plus beau sourire et lui ai tendu une enveloppe.\n\"Oh, Gloria, j'ai quelque chose pour toi !\"\nElle l'a ouverte avec empressement, y trouvant cinq billets de cent dollars craquants. Mais son sourire s'est évanoui lorsqu'elle a vu la facture détaillée qui se trouvait en dessous.\n\"Qu'est-ce que c'est ?\", a-t-elle bredouillé. \"Mille cinq cents dollars ? Tu n'es pas sérieuse !\"\n\"Tout à fait sérieuse\", ai-je répondu, en gardant ma voix calme mais ferme.\nUne femme debout, les bras croisés | Source : Midjourney\n\"Tu as détruit quelque chose que ma fille a mis des mois à créer. C'est le coût de sa restauration.\"\nStephen s'est rassis sur sa chaise, n'essayant même pas de cacher sa satisfaction. Le visage de Gloria est passé par plusieurs tons de rouge avant qu'elle ne parte en trombe, déclarant qu'elle récupérerait ses gnomes demain.\nFidèle à sa parole, elle s'est présentée le lendemain avec un chèque. Elle n'a pas dit un mot pendant qu'elle chargeait ses gnomes dans sa voiture, mais son expression crispée en disait long.\nNains de jardin dans un coffre de voiture | Source : Midjourney\nExpliquer la situation à Amy quand je suis allée la chercher chez ma mère le lendemain a été délicat, mais je me suis débrouillée.\n\"Gloria a vu des parasites dans ton jardin et a voulu t'aider en s'en débarrassant, mais elle a accidentellement endommagé les fleurs aussi. Elle ne voulait pas faire de mal au jardin et elle s'en veut beaucoup. Elle nous a donné de l'argent pour acheter toutes les fleurs que tu veux !\"\nLes yeux d'Amy se sont illuminés. \"Vraiment ? Est-ce qu'on peut avoir ces coneflowers violets que j'ai vus dans le catalogue ? Et peut-être des arbustes à papillons pour attirer les monarques ?\"\nUne fille parle avec enthousiasme dans une voiture | Source : Midjourney\n\"Tout ce que tu veux, ma chérie. C'est ton jardin.\"\nNous avons passé les week-ends suivants à reconstruire son jardin, à le rendre encore meilleur qu'avant. Amy a tout planifié méticuleusement, dessinant des schémas détaillés montrant l'emplacement de chaque plante. Elle a fait des recherches sur les plantes compagnes, apprenant quelles fleurs aideraient les autres à prospérer.\nC'est devenu un projet familial, Stephen construisant un système d'irrigation adéquat et moi aidant Amy à sélectionner le mélange parfait de plantes vivaces et annuelles.\nDes fleurs s'épanouissent dans un jardin | Source : Pexels\nLorsque nous avons fini de replanter le jardin, Amy a pris du recul pour admirer notre travail, les larmes aux yeux.\n\"Maman, c'est encore mieux qu'avant !\", a-t-elle exclamée en m'entourant de ses bras. \"Regarde comme les couleurs se mélangent ! Et le buisson à papillons attire déjà les abeilles !\"\nGloria est nettement plus silencieuse depuis, et j'ai remarqué que maintenant, elle réfléchit à deux fois avant de faire ses commentaires habituels.\nUne femme qui pèse ses mots | Source : Midjourney\nParfois, les meilleures leçons ont un prix, et en regardant Amy s'occuper de son jardin restauré, je sais que cela valait chaque centime.\nOn ne joue pas avec l'amour d'une mère pour son enfant. Si tu le fais, eh bien, tu risques de te retrouver avec mille cinq cents dollars en moins et une voiture pleine de nains de jardin.\nLe jardin a fleuri plus que jamais. Chaque fleur représente une petite victoire, non seulement sur la méchanceté de Gloria, mais aussi sur l'amour qui grandit entre une mère et sa fille, aussi stable et fort que les fleurs qu'Amy a plantées avec tant de soin.\nPapillons sur une fleur | Source : Pexels\nVoici une autre histoire : Lorsqu'Audrey annonce sa grossesse, sa belle-mère, Sydney, passe de serviable à envahissante, assistant aux échographies et obsédée par la sécurité de l'hôpital.

    "title": "OM-PSG: Partido perdido en caso de desliz, el gobierno amenaza",
    "text": "Para combatir la violencia y la homofobia en los estadios de Francia, el gobierno anunció este jueves una nueva medida. Los equipos pueden perder un partido en caso de que se repitan cánticos homofóbicos. Los deslices en los estadios de Francia no tienen fin. Esta temporada nuevamente estalló la violencia y se escucharon cánticos homofóbicos. Esto es demasiado para el gobierno que ha decidido reaccionar con una nueva medida. Contactado por la cadena BFM TV, el Ministro de Deportes Gil Avérous, además de la aplicación del protocolo de la FIFA que permite la interrupción de un partido, anunció la obligación de revelar su identidad para asistir a los partidos del París Saint-Germain, del Olympique de Marsella y del Olympique de Marsella. Olympique Lyonnais a partir del 31 de diciembre. París, Lyon y Marsella como prioridad « Nuestro deseo es individualizar y sancionar a quienes están en el origen de los comentarios y evitar en la medida de lo posible sanciones colectivas.explicó el ministro. Vamos a activar la venta de entradas nominativas, voy a firmar un decreto que entrará en vigor el 31 de diciembre y que hará obligatoria la venta de entradas nominativas para los partidos del Olympique Lyonnais, Olympique de Marseille y PSG. Cada aficionado en un estadio debe tener una entrada con su nombre claramente identificado para que podamos identificar de dónde provienen las canciones y comentarios, y para que podamos identificar a aquellos que están sujetos a una prohibición de ingresar al estadio. » En cuanto a los listos que se ponen una capucha al entrar al estadio para no ser reconocidos, Gil Avérous asegura que las cámaras permitirán identificarlos. “ Con la venta de entradas nominativas podremos resolver este problema que los clubes han luchado por afrontar hasta ahora. (…) Con la venta de entradas nominativas junto con las cámaras presentes en todos los estadios de la Ligue 1 y la Ligue 2, podremos identificar », certificó el miembro del gobierno, quien precisó que todos los clubes de las dos primeras divisiones estarán afectados al final de la temporada. Y que los culpables serán castigados con la prohibición de acceder al estadio. Partido perdido para el equipo local En cuanto a los partidos, en caso de interrupción de los partidos por cánticos homofóbicos, la sanción será severa, advierte el Ministro de Deportes, interrogado sobre el futuro encuentro todavía muy tenso entre OM y PSG el domingo por la noche. “ El pedido que se hizo a la FFF y a la LFP: Es que se apliquen directa y estrictamente las interrupciones del partido. Si se repiten cánticos homofóbicos. El partido será detenido y perdido para el equipo receptor. Es una petición muy clara que fue escuchada por la Liga de Fútbol. », subrayó Gil Averous para decir las cosas muy claramente sobre este tema en el que las autoridades del fútbol llevan años intentando cambiar las cosas.
