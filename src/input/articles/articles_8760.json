    "title": "Poll: More than 40% of Venezuelans – 10 Million People – Considering Leaving Country",
    "text": "A poll published this week by the Venezuelan firm Meganálisis found that 43.2 percent of Venezuelans — more than 10 million people — are considering leaving the country following the results of the July 28 sham presidential election, which socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro claims he “won.”\nVenezuela is enduring a new political crisis after the country’s National Electoral Council (CNE) — an entity controlled by the Maduro regime — claimed that Maduro was “reelected” for a third six-year term after “winning” the July 28 sham presidential election. The electoral authority has refused to publish voter data that could demonstrate that Maduro “obtained” 51 percent of the votes as they claim.\nThe Venezuelan opposition has accused Maduro of stealing the election and published thousands of vote tallies obtained on the day of the election that it claims can prove that its candidate, Edmundo González, was the actual winner of the election. Several countries and international organizations have denounced Maduro’s “victory” claims as fraudulent.\nThe situation has sparked nationwide protests that the Maduro regime responded to with a brutal crackdown campaign , resulting in at least 24 deaths and the arbitrary arrests of more than 2,400 individuals by the regime’s security forces. The rogue socialist regime has also enacted a new wave of internet censorship and the establishment of “ reeducation” camps for the detained dissidents.\nMeganálisis’s poll, conducted between August 8-11, found that 93.4 percent of the respondents consider that Edmundo González was the actual winner of the July 28 sham election. Another 92.7 percent expressed a lack of trust in the Venezuelan electoral authorities and the “results” announced by CNE head Elvis Amoroso of Maduro’s alleged “victory.”\nMost respondents expressed feeling “impotence, indignation, anxiety and annoyance” following the aftermath of the election.\n43.2 percent of the poll’s respondents said that they are considering leaving the country following the election. Meganálisis explained that 43.2 percent would represent 10.4 million Venezuelans, of which 6.9 million are part of the country’s electorate.\nOut of the 43.2 percent considering leaving, the polling firm further explained in a breakdown, 39.8 percent said they did not know when they would leave, 22.3 percent said that they will begin packing up at some point during 2025, 15.6 percent will do it after December, 5.8 percent in “a couple months,” and 1.6 will begin leaving “immediately.”\nMEGANALISIS\nENCUESTA FLASH (8/11 Agosto)\nVERDAD VENEZUELA\nCRISIS MIGRATORIA EN PUERTA\nEl 43.2% que está pensando en irse de Venezuela, eso es 6.9 MM de electores en el país (Aprox. 10.4 millones de población general).\nAhora mismo, alrededor de 100 mil hacen planes para migrar ya pic.twitter.com/mKENUgSoJC\n— Encuestadora Meganalisis (@Meganalisis) August 13, 2024\nOver the past decade, the collapse of socialism in Venezuela led by the Maduro regime and the ruling socialists’ growing authoritarianism prompted an unprecedented migrant crisis in the Western Hemisphere. Nearly 8 million Venezuelan citizens have fled their country since 2014.\nVenezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado warned last week that Maduro’s continued efforts to illegally cling to power would result in another Venezuelan migrant wave. Machado, in an online press conference with Mexican journalists, estimated that the prospective migrant wave could grow to total between 3-5 million Venezuelans “in a very short time.”\nAccording to statistical information from the Regional Inter-Agency Coordination Platform for Refugees and Migrants from Venezuela (R4V), the majority of the Venezuelan migrants in the region presently reside in Colombia, Peru, the United States, Brazil, Spain, Chile, Ecuador, and Argentina. The R4V platform is a joint effort between the U.N. Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to address the Venezuelan migrant crisis in Latin American and the Caribbean.\nIn July, the governments of Colombia and Peru announced that they would begin reinforcing their borders out of concern of a surge in Venezuelan migrants following the election.\nChile, whose far-left President Gabriel Boric has denounced Maduro’s fraudulent attempts to stay in power, reportedly made calls to prepare for a new Venezuelan migrant wave and has made proposals to other Latin American countries to agree on migrant “quotas” that each country is willing to accept.\nChilean presidential spokesperson Camila Vallejo said that the quota proposal is inspired by the migration management that European countries have done in the face of recent crises, such as the arrival of Ukrainian refugees fleeing from Russia’s ongoing invasion of their country.\n“The migration of Venezuelans has never ceased to our country,” Vallejo said in early August. “But, evidently, given the latest facts and events, what our government has done is to prepare for that possibility.”\nImmigration Latin America National Security Migrant Crisis Nicolas Maduro socialism Venezuela",

    "text": "MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. (WSVN) – A couple was arrested after causing a scare outside a day care facility in South Florida.\nEstrella Maria Pereira, who was one of the accused, said the two didn’t realize there was a day care near where they were pulling a publicity stunt.\n“It was a poor decision,” she said.\nPereira and Miguel Ruiz were seen taking two rifles out of a Corvette before aiming it directly at the Devon Aire Kiddy College in Miami-Dade County.\nPereira now says they made a mistake.\n“Really, we’re not bad people, we will never harm anyone or anything,” she said. “We’re bodybuilders and we’re into the social media thing, Youtube Channel, you know, Instagram so forth, and he thought it would be cool to take a picture with a gun, because with muscles and guns, and it sounds really cool, like if you look at a photograph like that.”\nThe incident was supposed to be a photoshoot, according to Pereira, but it put the day care on lockdown and alarmed many parents.\n“We did everything in our power to protect the children that are here in the facility and we followed every measure to stay safe,” an unnamed day care said.\nPereira has since been bailed out, while Ruiz is still being held in custody.\nWhat began as a publicity stunt is now causing the two to be faced with serious charges.\n“It’s ridiculous,” Pereira said. “And yes, it is getting blown out of proportion. But I do understand the severity, and how it could scare somebody, because I would be freaked out if I saw somebody doing the same thing, I’d be freaked out.”\nRuiz and Pereira have been ordered to stay away from the woman who called police and the day care center.\nCopyright 2024 WSVN via CNN Newsource.

Early low temperatures Friday night near 20 are expected, before rising overnight. The wintry mix will start with snow showers early Saturday morning, mixed in with some freezing rain/sleet. Highest ice accumulations are expected in Iowa though a light glaze may make it into far southwestern Wisconsin, especially areas closer to the Mississippi River, into Saturday afternoon. A Winter Weather Advisory will be in effect from midnight tonight until 6pm Saturday for far southwestern Wisconsin, where the best chance of a ice accumulation remains. This is where your First Warn Weather team is calling for ALERT DAY conditions Saturday.\nWATCH WARN.png\nFUTURETRACK.png\n2.png\n3.png\nEXTENDED FORECAST: By Saturday afternoon that will mix over to rain. The best chance of a mix is for areas southwest of Madison, although the precipitation may initially struggle to make it to the ground because of dry air in place from our recent arctic blast. Even as rain mixes in, cold pavement temperatures from several days of bitterly cold temperatures, there will likely be slick spots especially on untreated or less traveled roads. High temperatures by Sunday will warm up to near 40 degrees, with another system bringing shower chances back in by Sunday and Monday. The rest of next week looks seasonably cold, with some snow showers possible next Wednesday and Thursday.\n4.png\nGR-Ice-ADI.png\n10-Day-AM.png\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

    "text": "Lauryn Hill annule 17 concerts aux États-Unis et blâme les «médias sensationnalistes» Par Le Figaro avec AFP Publié il y a 10 heures Lire dans l’app Copier le lien Lien copié Mail Facebook Twitter Linkedin Messenger WhatsApp Lauryn Hill, Pras Michél et Wyclef Jean, des the Fugees ont performé en 2023 à Central Park, à New York. ARTURO HOLMES / Getty Images via AFP La chanteuse américaine de hip-hop, qui devait lancer sa tournée américaine dans quelques jours avec son ancien groupe The Fugees a finalement annulé ses concerts aux États-Unis.\n«Lauryn Hill, icône du rap, a annulé sa tournée américaine qu’elle devait lancer samedi avec le groupe The Fugees, a annoncé mercredi la plateforme de vente de billets de concerts et spectacles Ticketmaster. Au total, dix-sept dates, prévues jusqu’au 21 septembre, sont annulées moyennant un remboursement automatique des fans de Lauryn Hill . Ces derniers avaient commencé à recevoir des notifications des annulations la veille, selon plusieurs médias américains.\nLive Nation, société organisatrice de la tournée The Celebration Continues ( La fête continue ), a confirmé le remboursement, sans expliquer les raisons de l’annulation. Lauryn Hill a, elle, dénoncé : «Le penchant de certains médias pour le sensationnalisme et les gros titres des pièges à clics ont apparemment créé un récit qui a affecté la vente de billets pour la partie nord-américaine de la tournée. » Il semblerait que les dates étaient loin d’être complètes.\nLe lancement de la tournée était prévu vendredi 9 août à Tampa, en Floride. Elle devait ensuite se poursuivre dans d'autres villes américaines dont Atlanta, Philadelphie, Dallas, Houston et Milwaukee, totalisant 17 dates à travers le pays. La partie européenne de la tournée, qui doit commencer à Dublin en Irlande le 7 octobre et finir à Hambourg en Allemagne le 1er novembre, ne semble pas avoir été affectée.\nCette tournée de retrouvailles des Fugees , annoncée après le premier concert du groupe depuis plus de dix ans en septembre 2021, avait été une première fois repoussée, puis annulée, en raison de la pandémie de Covid-19. Elle avait repris l'année dernière, 25 ans après la sortie en 1998 de l'album solo culte The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill . En novembre 2023, elle avait de nouveau été suspendue en raison de la santé de la chanteuse de 49 ans, affectée par un problème aux cordes vocales.",
