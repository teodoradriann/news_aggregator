    "title": "Fans left horrified as Capri Sun looks set to introduce massive change to its drinks",
    "text": "Capri Sun is a drink loved by millions around the world, with it consumed in bucketloads during our childhoods. The beloved pouches of juice with a paper straw - which was once plastic if you're old enough to remember them like me - are a [packed lunch staple](https://www.ladbible.com/food-and-drink) alongside the likes of the iconic Dairylea Lunchables. Well, things are changing in the world of Capri Sun and some are absolutely not having it. Advert According to one major player in the world of snacks, Capri Sun is set to announce a major change to its product. Over [on Instagram](https://www.ladbible.com/instagram), food and snack blog Snackolator announced a major change when it comes to the packaging. It posted to its 415,000 followers: \"Capri Sun is coming for the adults with new bottles that will be arriving in stores soon. Advert \"These were announced for the upcoming NACS [National Association of Convenience Stores] show and will be in three flavours (at least) to start: Fruit Punch, Strawberry Kiwi, and Pacific Cooler. \"Each bottle is 12oz and won't need you to have to find the spot to poke the straw in and hope that it doesn't come shooting back at you. Are you excited for these?\" Reports suggest Capri Sun will start moving towards bottles over pouches, but nothing official has been said by Capri Sun. Advert It has to be said that it wouldn't be a brand new move for the company, with it using bottles for some products already. LADbible contacted Capri Sun on multiple occasions for comment but has not yet received a reply. Fans were not convinced over the [marketing](https://www.ladbible.com/business) change. \"Simple won't hit the same without the straw,\" one said on Instagram. Advert Another wrote: \"The f**k happened to respecting the pouch?\" And a third added: \"I prefer the pouch, maybe it's the nostalgia.\" A fourth posted 'this doesn't sit will with my spirit' and a fifth said: \"My childhood is ruined.\" It wasn't all negative though, with some embracing the product whatever format the juice is presented in. Advert One fan said: \"You're all tripping, I'm buying cases of this.\" A second concurred: \"Finally! I've been drinking the pouch like I'm still six years old.\" And a third said: \"All my dreams are coming true.\" It isn't the first time Capri Sun has tried to move away from its iconic packaging. In the early 2000s, the company started selling its drinks in metal bottles. Yes, metal. Topics: [UK News](/uk-news), [Food And Drink](/food-and-drink), [Viral](/viral)",

    "text": "Israeli forces have attacked areas of the central and southern Gaza Strip where residents have been expecting a renewed ground offensive in areas crammed with tens of thousands of Palestinians already displaced by the Israeli-Hamas war.\nWith nightfall on Thursday, an Israeli airstrike on a house in the southern city of Khan Younis killed eight Palestinians, health officials said.\nThree Palestinians were killed and six injured in an Israeli missile strike on a house in Maghazi camp in central Gaza, the Palestine Red Crescent said.\nThe Islamist group Hamas released video it said showed its fighters targeting Israeli tanks and soldiers east of Bureij. Reuters was not able to verify the location or the date the video was filmed.\nYamen Hamad has been living in a school in Deir al-Balah, also in central Gaza, since fleeing from the north. He said people newly displaced from Bureij and Nusseirat were setting up tents wherever there was open ground.\nIn one of Israel's latest airstrikes, 20 Palestinians were killed and 55 wounded in Rafah, a major town near the southern border with Egypt, Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said. Their bombed building was housing displaced civilians, according to local medics and residents.\nReuters video showed rescuers scrabbling frantically through rubble to uncover and pull out victims including a baby and several children and rushing them through milling crowds of dazed and weeping people to the nearby Kuwaiti Hospital.\nPalestinian health authorities said earlier that 210 people were confirmed killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, raising the toll of Palestinians killed in the war so far to 21,320 - nearly one per cent of Gaza's population. Thousands more dead were feared to be buried or lost in the ruins.\nOver the course of the war, the Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but it accuses Hamas of operating in densely populated areas and using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies.\nHamas and its fighters are dug deep into the Gaza Strip's dense cities and towns and their leaders are still at large.\nIsrael has reported 169 of its soldiers killed in its Gaza campaign after Hamas fighters rampaged through Israeli towns in a cross-border raid on October 7, killing 1200 people and taking about 240 hostages.\nSome 110 hostages were freed during a November 24-December 1 humanitarian pause and more than 20 others have been declared dead.\nUS President Joe Biden on Thursday said Hamas killed an American hostage, Judith Weinstein, 70, on October 7. Last week he said her husband Gadi Haggai, 73, was killed on the same day.\nThe Israeli military released findings of an investigation into the killings in error by its troops of three Israeli hostages in Gaza on December 15. Soldiers mistook their cries for help as a ruse by Hamas militants to draw them into an ambush, the military said, concluding that the soldiers acted rightly to the best of their understanding.\nEgypt on Thursday confirmed it had put forward a framework proposal to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip that includes three stages ending with a ceasefire and said it was awaiting responses on the plan.\nThe proposal is an attempt \"to bring viewpoints between all concerned parties closer, in an effort to stop Palestinian bloodshed and the aggression against the Gaza Strip and restore peace and stability to the region,\" Diaa Rashwan, head of Egypt's State Information Service, said in a statement.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will keep some form of security control of all Gaza indefinitely, though he insists that this would not amount to reoccupying the enclave.\nwith DPA\n ",

    "text": "By\n<a href=\"https://www.gbnews.com/authors/george-bunn\">George Bunn\n</a>\nPublished: 29/12/2023- 15:52\nDon't Miss\nMost Read\nTrending on GB News\nThe Met Office has issued six weather warnings as 2023 is set to end with a period of unsettled weather.\nThere are three warnings in place for rain and snow in Scotland including in Aberdeen, Inverness and Dundee.\nWarnings across Scotland are in place from 8am tomorrow and are expected to last all through the day.\nMeanwhile, there are yellow warnings for rain for the majority of Wales and Northern Ireland. A yellow warning for wind is in place through all of Saturday across the majority of the English south coast and in East Anglia.\nThe weather warnings for the UK\nMet Office\nThe warning for wind is expected to carry on into the early hours of New Year's Eve on Sunday.\nIt is also set to remain colder in Scotland, where overnight temperatures could drop to -10°C across the Grampians.\nMet Office chief forecaster Andy Page said: \"Parts of the higher ground of Scotland may see temporary snow accumulations of 5-10cm, while up to 25mm of rain is expected in Wales, Northern Ireland and lower levels in Scotland.\n\"Across Wales and southern England wind gusts of 45-50mph are likely to be quite widespread, while gusts of 65-75mph are possible in the most exposed coastal areas.\"\nLATEST DEVELOPMENTS\nA roofless house following a tornado on December 28, 2023 in Stalybridge, England\nGetty\nIt comes as many may be concerned about travel across the country for New Year's Eve celebrations to bring in 2024.\nRAC spokesman Rod Dennis said: “Storm Gerrit might have passed but, with another round of distinctly unsettled weather moving in, drivers are going to once again need to be ready to cope with difficult driving conditions in the run up to the new year.\n\"The most important thing they should do is reduce their speeds, especially on exposed and upland roads, and to always keep a firm hold of the steering wheel to avoid getting buffeted off course by the gusty winds.\n\"Driving slower also gives motorists more time to react to changing conditions up ahead and this is particularly important during periods of very heavy rainfall which can quickly reduce vehicles’ grip on the road and make driving hazardous.\"\nIt is set to turn cloudier in the southwest with rain on Tuesday.\nLooking further ahead into 2024, there is a forecast for colder temperatures.\nMet Office deputy chief forecaster Nick Silkstone said: \"Through to mid-January, there is a signal for a shift in the pattern compared to the winter so far, with more settled and colder-than-average conditions becoming increasingly likely.\"",
