    "text": "Nearly 4,000 violent assaults were reported on trains in Britain in the past year, figures obtained by the Liberal Democrats show.\nThe party called for “a serious strategy” to tackle crime on the railways as it accused the Conservatives of being “all bark and no bite”.\nBritish Transport Police (BTP) statistics show 3,991 incidents of violence against the person were reported on trains in the year to the end of November.\nThat is up 12% from the previous 12 months.\nThe figures also show 699 robberies were reported on trains in the year to the end of November, up 18% year on year, while sexual offences rose by 2.3% to 1,419.\nLiberal Democrat MP Sarah Olney, who obtained the data through a Freedom of Information request, said: “People deserve to feel safe when on public transport, yet these alarming figures tell a different story.\n“Far too often our train carriages are being turned into crime scenes as violent criminals are allowed to terrorise other passengers with impunity.\n“This Conservative Government is all bark and no bite. Rather than yet more rhetoric, we need a serious strategy to tackle this rise in crime on our railways.\n“The public deserves better – which is why the Liberal Democrats are calling for a return to local community policing which will help keep us safe.”\nBTP head of crime and public protection Detective Chief Superintendent Paul Furnell said: “Tackling crimes such as robbery and sexual offences are a force priority and we have dedicated taskforces as a result.\n“We are committed to making the network a hostile place for those who seek to commit such offences.\n“We are aware the data might not represent a true increase, with travel numbers only recently returning to pre-Covid levels.\n“Additionally, we continue to campaign to encourage victims and witnesses to report to us as a priority – particularly for sexual offences which we know are under-reported – and with this we expect the number of reports to continue to increase.\n“As a result of this, we continue our work to make reporting as accessible as possible for the travelling public, with our discreet text 61016 service turning 10 this year and the introduction of the free Railway Guardian app in 2022.”\nA Home Office spokesperson said: “We are providing police forces with the tools they need to deliver for the public and since 2010, our communities are safer.\n“Neighbourhood crimes including burglary, robbery and theft are down 50% and violent crime is down 52%.\n“There are also now 149,500 police officers keeping the public safe in England and Wales – the highest number on record.”",

    "text": "13-hour rescue: Family of kittens pulled from storm drain in 108-degree heat LAS VEGAS ( [KVVU](https://www.fox5vegas.com/2024/06/22/13-hour-las-vegas-kitten-rescue-108-degree-heat/)/Gray News) - A Las Vegas family spent 13 hours in triple-digit heat to rescue kittens and their mother from a storm drain. And after the hourslong ordeal, they were able to reunite the mother cat with her babies. The situation happened near a neighborhood park in the northwest part of town this week. Dana Hernandez said her daughter and husband were on an early morning walk when they heard crying coming from a storm drain. “They saw the mama cat jump into the sewer. That caught my child’s attention, and my husband came over and saw the kittens,” she said. Hernandez and her mother, Julie Woodward, said they called Las Vegas Animal Control several times, as well as the police department and the fire department. As temperatures soared to 108 degrees Fahrenheit, the family members said they yanked off the storm drain to drop down water and food for the kittens and the mother. “The mommy was very emaciated. We gave her two cans of food and she ate all of it. She was starving,” Woodward said. Hernandez managed to crawl down the storm drain and pull out several of the kittens. The family took them to an emergency veterinarian, who said they were dehydrated and malnourished. Animal control arrived that afternoon and with a small trap, they tried to retrieve the other cats still inside the drain. Volunteers also stepped in to help and were able to pull out the additional kittens, but then the mother cat could not be found. Late Friday night, Animal control officers dropped off another trap to help find the mother. “They were probably in there for a couple of days. They’re very, very small,” Woodward said. The family didn’t give up their efforts, either, and during the overnight hours, their mission was complete by locating the mother cat and reuniting her with her five kittens. “She was very scared, but she is safe with all five of her kittens rescued. The babies cried all night long, but when we added momma into the room with them, they all stopped and started nursing,” Hernandez said. The family said they plan to adopt all of the kittens.

O que a gente precisa, além do trabalho formal, é que tenha mais trabalho, [mais emprego na região](https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2017/01/24/desemprego-em-sao-paulo-aumenta-em-periferias-e-familias-mais-jovens).

O bairro tem a menor taxa de emprego formal entre os 96 distritos da capital paulista. O dado consta no último [Mapa da Desigualdade da Cidade de São Paulo](https://institutocidadessustentaveis.shinyapps.io/mapadesigualdadesaopaulo/), divulgado no ano passado, pela Rede Nossa São Paulo. O Brasil de Fato visitou a região para entender quais as demandas da população local e como a pouca oferta de serviço e as más condições do transporte público tem resultado na piora da qualidade de vida das famílias de Cidade Tiradentes, distante 35 quilômetros do centro da cidade. Na prática, a distância pode se traduzir em três horas para chegar ao serviço. \"99% das famílias trabalham longe daqui, cerca de duas horas, duas horas e meia de condução\", complementa Sebastião, sobre a realidade do condomínio José Maria Amaral, onde é zelador. Os problemas se refletem na confiança que o distrito de cerca de 220 mil habitantes deposita na atual gestão, [preterida pela maioria dos eleitores de Cidade Tiradentes no segundo turno da eleição de 2020](https://g1.globo.com/sp/sao-paulo/eleicoes/2020/noticia/2020/11/29/covas-vence-em-50-das-52-zonas-eleitorais-em-que-bolsonaro-foi-vitorioso-em-2018-boulos-ganha-na-periferia-onde-haddad-venceu.ghtml). Entre as 58 zonas eleitorais da cidade de São Paulo, a que abrange a Cidade Tiradentes (de número 404) é onde Bruno Covas (PSDB) e [Ricardo Nunes](https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2024/08/14/ricardo-nunes-cumpre-apenas-41-8-das-metas-como-prefeito-de-sao-paulo) (MDB) obtiveram a menor porcentagem de votos válidos (43,58%). Foi lá onde Guilherme Boulos (Psol), candidato opositor, teve a porcentagem mais expressiva de votos válidos (56,42%) dentre as 7 zonas eleitorais das quais saiu vencedor no último pleito. \"Eu acho que as próprias pessoas daqui elas estão querendo ver uma coisa diferente acontecendo, elas querem que as coisas mudem, querem uma pessoa que de fato chegue aqui e faça a diferença\", opina a pedagoga Alana Queiroz, também moradora do distrito. \"As pessoas diariamente perdem seis, sete horas por dia dentro do [transporte público](https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2024/04/14/modelo-de-contrato-de-transporte-publico-em-sao-paulo-facilita-lavagem-de-dinheiro-por-faccoes-criminosas) e isso é desumano\", complementa a produtora cultural Ellen Rio Branco, que chegou no distrito nos anos 1990. Problemas similares com o passado Assim como Sebastião, Eliane Mendes Ferreira representa uma das 396 famílias que moram no condomínio José Maria Amaral, na Vila Paulista, erguido graças ao Programa Minha Casa Minha Vida Entidades. A obra, iniciada em 2013, é uma conquista do Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Terra Leste 1. Quando chegou no bairro, há 30 anos, ela recorda da pouca oferta de escolas, conduções, e a passagem esporádica dos ônibus, sempre lotados. Os desafios, apesar de alguns avanços, ainda são similares. \"A gente não tem só o problema da distância, mas a gente também tem o problema que as linhas de ônibus são planejadas para darem muitas voltas dentro do bairro. Então, um percurso que talvez de carro você faça, sei lá, em 50 minutos, uma hora, pra gente é duas horas, duas horas e meia. E se você tem que cumprir um horário de serviço de 8 horas, 9 horas, você acaba ficando 14, 15 horas fora de casa. Então você chega só pra dormir mesmo\", explica Eliane. Cansada das longas distâncias, ela sobrevive hoje do Bolsa Família e da ajuda mensal dos três filhos, que trabalham de forma autônoma na região. Para complementar a renda, vende bolos na rua, na Cidade Patriarca, também na zona leste. \"Hoje eu tenho sobrepeso, eu tenho pressão alta, eu tenho um problema no joelho, poque eu já trabalhei em muitas outras funções, né? Então o que acontece? Além de você ter a sobrecarga do trabalho em si, ainda tem a distância para você ir, então às vezes eu não cumpro a função como deveria. E se fosse o serviço perto de casa, eu já conseguiria. Porque isso ia impactar muito menos no tempo que eu fico em pé, no tempo que eu ando\", explica a trabalhadora. \"Eu consigo melhorar um pouco a minha renda com o trabalho informal. Mas, por exemplo, se tivesse uma empresa onde eu pudesse trabalhar, eu estaria com todos os meus direitos\", completa. Bairro-dormitório [Cidade Tiradentes abriga o maior complexo de conjuntos habitacionais da América Latina](https://institutobixiga.com.br/cidade-tiradentes-memoria-viva-de-lutas-e-resistencia-popular-na-zona-leste-de-sao-paulo/), com aproximadamente 40 mil unidades. A maioria desses empreendimentos de moradia popular foi erguida ao longo da década de 1980, por meio da Companhia Metropolitana de Habitação de São Paulo (Cohab), e a Companhia de Desenvolvimento Habitacional e Urbano do Estado de São Paulo (CDHU). Rapidamente, o bairro se transformou em um dos maiores fenômenos de crescimento urbano da história de São Paulo. Em 20 anos, de 1980 a 2000, Cidade Tiradentes passou de 8.603 habitantes para 190.657, segundo o IBGE. O bairro foi planejado seguindo o modelo de bairro dormitório, ou seja, seus moradores trabalhavam no centro de São Paulo ou nas fábricas do ABC, e usavam o bairro apenas para descansar ao fim da jornada. É o caso da família de Ellen Rio Branco, uma das primeiras a chegar na região. \"Teve um período nos anos 1980 que Cidade Tiradentes tinha um ônibus com o maior itinerário da cidade de São Paulo. Então, a gente sempre viveu esse lugar de margem, de borda, de extremo\", revela. A atriz e articuladora cultural explica que a luta da população do distrito por melhores condições de transporte público e para desfazer esse posto de \"bairro dormitório\" é histórica mas esbarra na falta de atenção do poder público. \"A minha mãe lutava lá nos anos 80, 90 por transporte e a gente segue lutando por isso. A gente segue lutando por empregabilidade dentro do território. A gente ainda segue nesse lugar, porque ainda hoje a maior parte da população vivencia mais o período de deslocamento do que ou executando a sua função profissional, ou suas outras tarefas de lazer com os seus filhos\", explica Rio Branco. \"Tiradentes é o lugar onde v [ocê tem a menor expectativa de vida comparado a outros territórios](https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2019/11/05/moradores-da-periferia-de-sp-vivem-23-anos-a-menos-do-que-os-de-areas-nobres), como Moema. Então isso também faz com que as pessoas vivam menos. Você começa a perder ali tempo de vida, qualidade de vida\", completa. Alana Queiroz, cansada de buscar serviço dentro da sua formação, escolheu o caminho de abrir seu próprio negócio. Inaugurou o Perifa´s Lounge e Bar, que além de ser sua fonte de renda principal atualmente, procura engajar a população do bairro em torno da cultura hip hop. \"Durante todo esse tempo que eu fiquei procurando emprego aqui na região. É muito difícil encontrar na minha área e sempre é muito distante o que compromete muito a qualidade de vida\", explica Queiroz. \"Então você criar algo dentro da periferia e oferecer um espaço dentro da periferia, é você dar acesso também para as pessoas que moram aqui, é acreditar no potencial comprador, no potencial participativo da periferia, não é só um bar local, mas é um espaço que está disponível perto de casa\", complementa. Empresas na região Já Elliot Meirelles, com 29 anos, é corretor de imóveis. O jovem, nascido e criado no distrito e com o ensino médio concluído na Escola Técnica Estadual de Cidade Tiradentes, considera que toda sua formação e \"construção de personalidade e cidadania\" vem da vivência no distrito. Mas a saída para outros bairros mais distantes se tornou necessária quando entrou na faculdade, e depois já no primeiro trabalho, na região da Avenida Paulista. Ele também acredita que o longo tempo de deslocamento afeta a qualidade de vida da população. \"Acho que devido à dificuldade das pessoas se deslocarem, isso acaba impactando na saúde psicológica e mental das pessoas\", explica. Para chegar em Cidade Tiradentes, a população do distrito precisa desembarcar na estação de Guaianases ou na estação de Itaquera. A partir desses locais, o trajeto precisa ser feito somente por meio do transporte rodoviário. \"Há situações onde se leva até uma hora para chegar em Guaianazes\", lamenta Meirelles. Um incentivo do poder público para que as empresas se descentralizem ou saiam de bairros onde elas costumam se instalar, na opinião dele, seria um caminho para a permanência da população no bairro, principalmente dos mais jovens. \"Inclusive, muitas das pessoas que ocupam cargos em multinacionais, empresas grandes, cargos relevantes, residem nas periferias\", defende. Cursos profissionalizantes Mas essa não é uma reivindicação única. Segundo boa parte da população local, para que jovens e adultos da Cidade Tiradentes possam adquirir bons empregos, apenas a instalação de empresas na região não basta. Ellen Rio Branco defende, por exemplo, que o poder público ajude a formar profissionais em áreas não estereotipadas. \"Tem um espaço que é o Centro de Formação Cultural Cidade Tiradentes, que fica aqui no Vila Holanda, que foi um espaço de reivindicação do território, que era para ser um espaço de formação para as artes. A pessoa podia sair formada em cenografia, sonoplastia, em dramaturgia. Só que hoje o que a gente vê é o que acontece é diferente, tem curso de segurança, tem curso de babá. Partem do pressuposto que aqui as pessoas só podem fazer esse tipo de trabalho. As pessoas não podem pensar em outras possibilidades\", explica a produtora cultural No distrito, a Prefeitura oferece também cursos profissionalizantes dentro do Centro de Desenvolvimento Social e Produtivo para Adolescentes, Jovens e Adultos (Cedesp). É uma das 58 unidades que a gestão administra no município, totalizando 11.340 vagas em toda a cidade para jovens e adultos entre 15 e 59 anos, número que representa apenas 4% da população da Cidade Tiradentes. Em meio a pouca oferta de cursos profissionalizantes, outro problema se instala na região: quem consegue ingressar em um trabalho formal tem renda menor se comparada a outras regiões da cidade. Enquanto no distrito de São Domingos, na zona noroeste da cidade de São Paulo, a remuneração média é de R$ 8.515,29; em Cidade Tiradentes o valor fica em R$ 3.144, valor inferior à média da cidade, que é de R$ 3.722,7. \"A gente vive muito essa política também de punição por ser pobre, preto, mulher, de ser um jovem preto, então a política acontece já quando você já está na vulnerabilidade, esses espaços ainda são espaços muito de subalternidade\", finaliza Ellen. O Brasil de Fato questionou a Prefeitura de São Paulo sobre quais medidas e programas são destinados especificamente para ampliar as vagas formais de emprego no distrito de Cidade Tiradentes, se houve ampliação nos últimos quatro anos na quantidade de linhas de ônibus em Cidade Tiradentes que vão às regiões centrais da capital e por que o Centro de Formação Cultural deixou de oferecer cursos de cenografia, sonoplastia e dramaturgia, conforme dito pelos moradores. Nenhuma das questões foi respondida até o momento. Se houver um posicionamento, o texto será atualizado.

    "text": "Udhampur District Embraces Lavender Cultivation: A Boon for Farmers and Economy The Department of Agriculture in Udhampur, Jammu and Kashmir, has successfully cultivated five lakh lavender plants in Incha village. This initiative, aimed at doubling farmers' incomes and mitigating crop damage by monkeys, marks the first introduction of lavender farming in the region. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 19-07-2024 09:27 IST | Created: 19-07-2024 09:27 IST - Country: - India In a pivotal step for the agricultural landscape of Udhampur district in Jammu and Kashmir, the Department of Agriculture has cultivated around five lakh lavender mother plants at Incha village in Ramnagar tehsil. This marks the district's inaugural venture into lavender farming, a move supported by the region's favorable climatic conditions and soil composition. The department has utilized approximately 100 kanals of land in Incha village to grow these mother plants. These plants will be distributed to local farmers, providing them with a dual benefit. Not only will this initiative boost farmers' incomes, but it will also offer protection against crop damage caused by the prevalent monkey population, which has been a persistent issue. Lavender farming is set to revolutionize Udhampur's agricultural scene by offering a profitable alternative to traditional crops. Given the high market demand for lavender products, farmers can anticipate significant financial gains. Additionally, lavender's natural pest-repelling properties enhance its attractiveness as a crop choice. Anju Devi, a local resident, expressed her joy over the blooming lavender plants. She highlighted the role of government schemes in empowering women and noted that lavender farming presents a great opportunity for financial independence. Prior reliance on maize crops, often destroyed by wild animals, underscored the need for more profitable and resilient agricultural options. Rafiq Ahamed Jaral, SDM Ramnagar, emphasized the suitability of the region's climate for lavender cultivation. He mentioned a nursery has been established in Incha village, where five lakh lavender saplings have been prepared. These saplings will be distributed among farmers in the coming months. Saloni Rai, Deputy Commissioner Udhampur, outlined the 'Purple Revolution' initiative under which the lavender plantation is being carried out.

    "text": "Lala Kent recently revealed the due date for her second baby. She is pregnant by doing IUI treatments and a sperm donor. This has been an amazing experience for her. She did not want to depend on finding someone to have another baby with. It is not in her books right now to have another baby daddy. She also expressed that she wanted to have holidays to herself and not have to share them with the baby daddy who is not in her life anymore. She has become a role model to many single women who want a child but do not have a partner. Lala Kent Gets Pregnant On First Try Lala Kent started by getting her IUD out and tracking her ovulation cycle. She then started her IUI treatments after picking out her sperm donor. Lala was extremely lucky as she got pregnant on her first try. This was not expected by her or her doctor. She then went on to tell her daughter Ocean she was going to be a big sister. Ocean was confused at first but eventually understood and seemed excited . She did have to clarify with her mom, Lala, that she did not have a baby in her belly, only Lala. However, Lala is ready to have this baby and feels ready with all of the support she has. She Revealed Her Due Date Lala Kent recently revealed the due date of her second baby. It is September 1, 2024, which is one day before Lala’s birthday. She revealed this information on the after-show with Brittany Cartwright. She does not yet know the gender of the baby but plans to find out as soon as she can. “We don’t know what we’re having quite yet. I mean my group, my communal… So I’ll find out in a couple of weeks. My due date is September 1, which is so wild because my birthday is September 2,” She has a huge amount of support with her friends and family. It seems as though Lala could be having her second baby on her birthday. That may be her best birthday present yet. She is ecstatic to have another child. Her daughter Ocean is also excited to be a big sister. Lala has an enormous amount of support surrounding her and does not need a partner to have another baby. She has many friends and family who will help her along the way. What do you think about her journey?
