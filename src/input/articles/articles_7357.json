    "text": "Iraq Stun Japan To Reach Asian Cup Last 16, Iran Join Them\nMohammad Ali\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChaudhryMAli88\">\n(@ChaudhryMAli88)\n</a>\nPublished January 20, 2024 | 02:00 AM\nDoha, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 20th Jan, 2024)\nIraq coach Jesus Casas said his team were \"close to perfect\" in stunning Asian Cup favourites Japan 2-1 on Friday to reach the knockout rounds, where they were joined by rivals Iran.\nAymen Hussein scored two first-half headers in front of nearly 40,000 in\nDoha to consign four-time champions Japan to a first Asian Cup group-stage defeat in 26 matches.\nIt also set\nJapan on a potential collision course with Son Heung-min's South Korea in the last 16, assuming they still progress.\nCasas said that the first big shock of the tournament was \"only one win\" but hailed it as \"a great day for Iraqi people\".\n\"I think the perfect match doesn't exist,\" said the Spaniard.\n\"It's impossible to have a perfect match, but we were close to perfect.\"\nHussein headed\nIraq -- ranked 63 in the world compared to Japan's 17 -- into the lead in the fifth minute and struck again in first-half injury time. Iraq endured a nervous finish after Liverpool's Wataru Endo pulled one back in the third of eight minutes of injury time at the end of the game.\n\"\nAll the players were concentrating on this match and we were all ready for it,\" said Hussein, who also scored in a 3-1 win over Indonesia. Iraq won the Asian Cup in 2007 and are dreaming of upsetting the odds all over again.\n- 'Painful memory' -\nAlso Friday,\nIndonesia defeated Vietnam 1-0 thanks to a 42nd-minute penalty by Asnawi Mangkualam.\nIt means\nIndonesia and Japan will battle it out on Wednesday for the second qualification spot from Group D, although finishing third might also be enough.\nHajime Moriyasu's\nJapan beat Vietnam 4-2 in their opener and went into the Iraq game on the back of a 10-match winning streak in which they scored 43 goals. Japan beat Spain and Germany to reach the last 16 of the 2022 Qatar World Cup.\nBut they had no answer to the power and aggression of an\nIraq side roared on by most of the crowd at education City Stadium.\nHussein headed home for the opening goal when the ball fell to him after\nJapan goalkeeper Zion Suzuki flapped at a cross.\nHe notched his second just before half-time, holding off Hiroki Ito to nod home\nfrom close range.\n\"The atmosphere was like an away game and conceding early hurt us,\" said Moriyasu, but he refused to criticise the 21-year-old\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/latest-news/suzuki.html, who was also shaky against Vietnam.\n\"For him and for the team it will be a painful memory, but I want him to embrace the challenge,\" said the\ncoach.\n-\nIran toil into last 16 - Iran joined Iraq, Australia and hosts and holders Qatar in the last 16 but they made hard work of beating Hong Kong 1-0.\nOn paper the fixture was among the biggest mismatches at the tournament, with\nIran ranked 21st in the world to Hong Kong's 150. Iran, hunting a record-equalling fourth continental crown, dominated possession in front of 36,412 at the Khalifa International Stadium.\nBut\nHong Kong -- playing at their first Asian Cup in more than 55 years -- had opportunities early on, especially when Brazil-born forward Everton Camargo blazed over from inside the box. Iran scored what turned out to be the winner in the 24th minute when Mehdi Ghayedi slid a shot across the six-yard box and past the despairing grasp of goalkeeper Yapp Hung-fai, the ball nestling in the bottom-right corner.\nRecent Stories\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/sports/bowlers-impress-at-all-three-venues-in-fourth-1786993.html\"> 7 hours ago\n</a>\nBowlers impress at all three venues in fourth round of National Women's T20\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/sports/pcb-introduces-retainers-for-women-panel-of-u-1786988.html\nPCB introduces retainers for Women Panel of Umpires\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/lion-may-hide-again-to-see-public-passion-bi-1786969.html\"> 8 hours ago\n</a>\nLion may hide again to see public passion, Bilawal sarcastically targets Nawaz\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/business/chinas-economic-resilience-in-2023-1786927.html\"> 9 hours ago\n</a>\nChina's economic resilience in 2023\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/nsc-caretaker-cabinet-due-today-amid-pakista-1786914.html\"> 10 hours ago\n</a>\nNSC, caretaker cabinet due today amid Pakistan and Iran tensions\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/cheezious-unveils-new-corporate-headquarters-1786913.html\nCheezious Unveils New Corporate Headquarters in Islamabad, Reinforcing Commitmen ..\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/cipher-case-govt-challenges-ihc-decision-bef-1786910.html\nCipher Case: Govt challenges IHC decision before SC against Imran Khan’s trial\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/pakistan-has-no-interest-or-desire-in-escalat-1786890.html\"> 11 hours ago\n</a>\nPakistan has no interest or desire in escalating tension with Iran: Caretaker FM\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/technology/punjab-governments-e-stamping-initiative-sur-1786880.html\nPunjab Government's e-Stamping Initiative Surpasses Rs 351 Billion in Revenue Co ..\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/technology/vivo-y27s-a-visual-symphony-and-design-marve-1786873.html\nVivo Y27s: A Visual Symphony and Design Marvel\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/technology/infinix-shines-as-the-most-innovative-mobile-1786866.html\nInfinix Shines as the Most Innovative Mobile Phone Brand at CES 2024\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/un-chief-urges-pakistan-iran-to-de-escalate-1786831.html\"> 13 hours ago\n</a>\nUN Chief urges Pakistan, Iran to de-escalate & resolve all issues peacefully\nMore Stories From World\n-\nDefending champions Senegal beat Cameroon to book last-16 place7 minutes ago\n-\nFootball: Italian Super Cup result7 minutes ago\n-\nFootball: Asian Cup results and tables37 minutes ago\n-\nBoeing 747 cargo plane makes emergency landing in Miami47 minutes ago\n-\nTata Steel axes UK jobs as industry forges 'greener' future1 hour ago\n-\nFootball: Africa Cup of Nations table1 hour ago\n-\nHall of Fame golfer Jack Burke dies at 1002 hours ago\n-\nFootball: Africa Cup of Nations results - 1st update2 hours ago\n-\nFootball: Africa Cup of Nations tables2 hours ago\n-\n'Close to perfect': Iraq stun Japan to reach Asian Cup last 164 hours ago\n-\nTennis: Australian Open results - collated4 hours ago\n-\nSarrazin trumps Odermatt for prestigious Kitzbuehel downhill win4 hours ago",

    "text": "- Details\n- By Native News Online Staff\nFollowing the Oak Ridge Fire, Council Delegates Vince James and Brenda Jesus led a coordinated effort to distribute essential supplies to families returning to their homes. The initial phase of relief included the delivery of food, water, hygiene products, and cleaning supplies to assist residents in the early stages of recovery.\nIn partnership with the Oak Springs Chapter, St. Michaels Chapter, the Oak Ridge Fire Incident Command Post, Community Health Representatives, and local volunteers, Delegates James and Jesus ensured on-site distribution of critical resources to displaced families.\nCouncil Delegate Jesus also carried out home visits throughout the Oak Springs community to reach vulnerable households with direct support. Each care package contained bottled water, non-perishable food, baby items, hygiene kits, and personal protective equipment. Cleaning materials were also provided to help families safely remove debris and fire residue from their homes.\nBoth Delegates underscored the importance of sustained community engagement and made sure every returning household received immediate assistance and follow-up. In addition, they worked alongside local officials to assess and document long-term needs, including utility restoration and structural repairs.\nThe response effort represents a unified approach among Navajo Nation leadership, emergency management personnel, and community members committed to supporting recovery and rebuilding.\nDonations of non-perishable food, hygiene items, and cleaning supplies continue to be distributed. Residents are encouraged to contact their local chapter for information on future distribution events.\nCommunity members affected by the fire are also advised to reach out to their local chapter or the Navajo Nation Department of Emergency Management for updates on available services and ongoing recovery initiatives.\nMore Stories Like This\nNative News Weekly (August 25, 2024): D.C.

Briefs\nNational Native Organizations and Tribal Leaders Respond to Ann Clouter’s ‘We Didn’t Kill Enough Indians’ Remark\nHelp us tell the stories that could save Native languages and food traditions\nAt a critical moment for Indian Country, Native News Online is embarking on our most ambitious reporting project yet: \"Cultivating Culture,\" a three-year investigation into two forces shaping Native community survival—food sovereignty and language revitalization.\nThe devastating impact of COVID-19 accelerated the loss of Native elders and with them, irreplaceable cultural knowledge. Yet across tribal communities, innovative leaders are fighting back, reclaiming traditional food systems and breathing new life into Native languages. These aren't just cultural preservation efforts—they're powerful pathways to community health, healing, and resilience.\nOur dedicated reporting team will spend three years documenting these stories through on-the-ground reporting in 18 tribal communities, producing over 200 in-depth stories, 18 podcast episodes, and multimedia content that amplifies Indigenous voices. We'll show policymakers, funders, and allies how cultural restoration directly impacts physical and mental wellness while celebrating successful models of sovereignty and self-determination.\nThis isn't corporate media parachuting into Indian Country for a quick story. This is sustained, relationship-based journalism by Native reporters who understand these communities. It's \"Warrior Journalism\"—fearless reporting that serves the 5.5 million readers who depend on us for news that mainstream media often ignores.\nWe need your help right now. While we've secured partial funding, we're still $450,000 short of our three-year budget. Our immediate goal is $25,000 this month to keep this critical work moving forward—funding reporter salaries, travel to remote communities, photography, and the deep reporting these stories deserve.\nEvery dollar directly supports Indigenous journalists telling Indigenous stories. Whether it's $5 or $50, your contribution ensures these vital narratives of resilience, innovation, and hope don't disappear into silence.\nThe stakes couldn't be higher. Native languages are being lost at an alarming rate. Food insecurity plagues many tribal communities. But solutions are emerging, and these stories need to be told.\nSupport independent Native journalism. Fund the stories that matter.\nLevi Rickert (Potawatomi), Editor & Publisher",

    "title": "Boxer Gervonta Davis follows Muhammad Ali by converting to Islam as undefeated champ reveals his new name",
    "text": "BOXING superstar Gervonta Davis has changed his name after converting to Islam. The controversial WBA (regular) lightweight champion made the decision to convert to the religion a while back. Baltimore bruiser Davis completed his conversion to Islam at a Maryland mosque this past weekend. And in a similar move to boxing icon Muhammad Ali , who was known as Cassius Clay before adopting Islam in 1964, Davis has now changed his name to Abdul Wahid. After overseeing Davis' Islamic testimony of faith, Imam Hassan Abdi told the Baltimore Banner: “The humility I get from him. \"And I was surprised meeting him, because I knew who he was but I wasn’t familiar to what extent — he was a very down-to-earth person. “The conversation was about being the best version of what we can be as human beings.” It's not yet known if Davis has legally changed his name or whether he will fight under his new moniker. Brutal knockout artist Davis has been blighted by controversy during his professional career. But Abdi said of the southpaw: “At heart, he’s a good person, and I think he wants more. I think he wants more for himself, which is good. “Him investing in the area, buying a block and trying to improve it for the residents there, I think all of that may be also an influence to hear something different. \"Islam, and I was telling him, religion makes us the best version of who we are, to be better human beings. \"We believe in one God and we worship him alone, and that brings accountability and responsibility for ourselves, and also trying to help others. And I think it resonated with him.” Elaborating on Davis' past indiscretions, Abdi: \"We’re not perfect as human beings. “We all go through challenges in life. It’s about having hope and not despairing. \"When we fall down — with him as a boxer, I told him, when you’re boxing, when a person goes down, you try your best to get back up. \"That’s like life. I think that you’re never going to be perfect overnight and we may never reach completion, but it’s about trying to be better. \"I see that he’s trying to be a better individual.”",

    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",
