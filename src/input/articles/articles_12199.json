    "text": "How to spot scams like \"Coinbase Enhanced Security Measures\" fake website\n[ Written by ](https://www.pcrisk.com/tomas-meskauskas)[Tomas Meskauskas](https://www.pcrisk.com/tomas-meskauskas) on\nWhat is \"Coinbase Enhanced Security Measures\"?\nOur team has examined this website and found that it mimics the real page (coinbase.com) to trick individuals into taking actions that could result in significant financial losses. This fraudulent platform should be avoided. It is advisable to always verify the legitimacy of web pages before interacting with them.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: We do not review crypto projects, please do your own research when investing money.\n[Federal Trade Comission (FTC) states](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2022/06/reports-show-scammers-cashing-crypto-craze) that since the start of 2021, more than 46,000 people have reported losing over $1 billion in crypto to scams – that's about one out of every four dollars reported lost, more than any other payment method.\n\"Coinbase Enhanced Security Measures\" scam in detail\nCoinbase (coinbase.com) is a popular cryptocurrency exchange platform that allows users to buy, sell, trade, and store various cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. It is a legitimate platform and should not be confused with the fraudulent one (web3walletbase[.]com).\nOn the fake website, users are informed that their account requires additional verification to protect their assets. The site encourages users to connect their wallets and confirm access rights to complete the security check. Connecting a wallet on this fake website activates a cryptocurrency drainer.\nThis drainer is a malicious tool designed to transfer cryptocurrency from the victim's wallet to the scammer's. In other words, it allows scammers to steal cryptocurrency from victims. Unfortunately, recovering stolen cryptocurrency is extremely difficult because crypto transactions are irreversible.\nOnce funds are sent to a scammer's wallet, they cannot be retrieved unless the scammer willingly returns them. Therefore, it is important to be careful when connecting wallets, providing personal information, or making transactions. Before performing these actions, users should always ensure the platform they use is legitimate.\nName | Coinbase Enhanced Security Measures fraudulent site |\nThreat Type | Phishing, Scam, Social Engineering, Fraud |\nFake Claim | Coinbase account requires additional verification to protect assets |\nDisguise | Official Coinbase platform |\nRelated Domain | web3walletbase[.]com |\nDetection Names (web3walletbase[.]com) | CRDF (Malicious), Fortinet (Phishing), Kaspersky (Phishing), Sophos (Malware), VIPRE (Malware), Full List Of Detections (\n|\nTo eliminate possible malware infections, scan your computer with legitimate antivirus software.

They usually instruct potential victims to connect their wallets to get free tokens. However, they sometimes use tactics involving fake alerts regarding account security to lure individuals.\nExamples of similar scams are the fake \"[Binance Bitcoin Payout](/removal-guides/31561-binance-bitcoin-payout-scam)\", \"[$PAW Token Exchange](/removal-guides/31523-paw-token-exchange-scam)\", and \"[LINGO Airdrop](/removal-guides/31520-lingo-airdrop-scam)\" platforms.\nHow did I open a scam website?\nScam sites involving crypto drainers are commonly spread through hijacked WordPress sites or hacked (or fake) social media accounts (e.g., X/Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms). Visiting sites connected to rogue ad networks often found on torrent sites, illegal streaming services, or adult websites, can also direct users to fraudulent pages.\nIn other cases, users can open scam websites via unreliable ads, pop-ups, misleading buttons, suspicious links, and deceptive emails. Adware can also redirect users to these harmful sites. Overall, scammers use various methods to lure users into visiting scam websites.\nHow to avoid visiting scam pages?\nBe careful with emails or messages from unknown sources, especially if they have links or attachments. Do not click on pop-ups, ads, and other content on suspicious sites, and avoid torrent sites, illegal streaming pages, and similar platforms.

They collect sensitive personal data, trick Internet users into calling fake tech support numbers, subscribe to useless online services, invest in shady cryptocurrency schemes, etc.\nWhile in the majority of cases these pop-ups don't infect users' devices with malware, they can cause direct monetary loss or could result in identity theft.\nCybercriminals strive to create their rogue pop-up windows to look trustworthy, however, scams typically have the following characteristics:\n- Spelling mistakes and non-professional images - Closely inspect the information displayed in a pop-up. Spelling mistakes and unprofessional images could be a sign of a scam.\n- Sense of urgency - Countdown timer with a couple of minutes on it, asking you to enter your personal information or subscribe to some online service.\n- Statements that you won something - If you haven't participated in a lottery, online competition, etc., and you see a pop-up window stating that you won.\n- Computer or mobile device scan - A pop-up window that scans your device and informs of detected issues - is undoubtedly a scam; webpages cannot perform such actions.\n- Exclusivity - Pop-up windows stating that only you are given secret access to a financial scheme that can quickly make you rich.\nExample of a pop-up scam:\nHow do pop-up scams work?\nCybercriminals and deceptive marketers usually use various advertising networks, search engine poisoning techniques, and shady websites to generate traffic to their pop-ups. Users land on their online lures after clicking on fake download buttons, using a torrent website, or simply clicking on an Internet search engine result.\nBased on users' location and device information, they are presented with a scam pop-up. Lures presented in such pop-ups range from get-rich-quick schemes to fake virus scans.\nHow to remove fake pop-ups?\nIn most cases, pop-up scams do not infect users' devices with malware. If you encountered a scam pop-up, simply closing it should be enough. In some cases scam, pop-ups may be hard to close; in such cases - close your Internet browser and restart it.\nIn extremely rare cases, you might need to reset your Internet browser. For this, use our instructions explaining [how to reset Internet browser settings](/how-to-remove-spyware/reset-browser-settings).\nHow to prevent fake pop-ups?\nTo prevent seeing pop-up scams, you should visit only reputable websites. Torrent, Crack, free online movie streaming, YouTube video download, and other websites of similar reputation commonly redirect Internet users to pop-up scams.\nTo minimize the risk of encountering pop-up scams, you should keep your Internet browsers up-to-date and use reputable anti-malware application. For this purpose, we recommend [Combo Cleaner Antivirus for Windows](/download-combo-cleaner-windows).\nWhat to do if you fell for a pop-up scam?\nThis depends on the type of scam that you fell for. Most commonly, pop-up scams try to trick users into sending money, giving away personal information, or giving access to one's device.\n- If you sent money to scammers: You should contact your financial institution and explain that you were scammed. If informed promptly, there's a chance to get your money back.\n- If you gave away your personal information: You should change your passwords and enable two-factor authentication in all online services that you use. Visit\n[Federal Trade Commission](https://www.identitytheft.gov)to report identity theft and get personalized recovery steps. - If you let scammers connect to your device: You should scan your computer with reputable anti-malware (we recommend\n[Combo Cleaner Antivirus for Windows](/download-combo-cleaner-windows)) - cyber criminals could have planted trojans, keyloggers, and other malware, don't use your computer until removing possible threats. - Help other Internet users: report Internet scams to\n[Federal Trade Commission](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov).\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\nWhat is a scam website?\nA scam website, often designed to appear legitimate, is a deceptive site created to mislead users.

    "title": "Supreme Court Deals Major Blow to the Administrative State",
    "text": "The Constitution separates power, the administrative state fuses it. The Constitution gives Congress the power to make law, the president the power to enforce law, and the courts the power to apply law to specific cases. The administrative state takes all three for itself.\nToday, however, the Supreme Court delivered an important blow against that administrative fusion of powers by standing up for the right to have your case heard by a jury. It held that if the Securities and Exchange Commission prosecutes you for fraud, you’re entitled to have your case heard by a jury of your peers.\nAn administrative agency like the SEC can make a law, charge you for violating it, and prosecute you before its own in-house tribunals—where the judges whose salaries it pays rule in its favor 90% of the time .\nThat’s what happened to George Jarkesy, who was prosecuted by the SEC in one of its in-house tribunals for allegedly committing securities fraud.\nJarkesy filed suit in federal court to defend his Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial , and 10 years later, the Supreme Court heard his case.\nThe Seventh Amendment guarantees a jury trial right in all “suits at common law.” One such suit is fraud, and Jarkesy argued that because securities fraud is a type of fraud, he should get a jury.\nThe government responded that the Seventh Amendment does not apply when the government enforces a “public right,” that is, a right created by Congress through law and entrusted to the administrative state for protection.\nJarkesy replied that the text of the Seventh Amendment makes no such distinctions, and what’s more, the results of the government’s argument would be absurd.\nUnder the government’s theory, victims of reckless drivers could be forced into administrative law courts if Congress decided that the injured motorist’s recovery of damages mattered less than the public’s interest in highway safety. Same thing for medical malpractice suits—the government has an interest in safe medicine, so it can drag defendants to a Washington back office where a bureaucrat will inevitably side with the agency that pays his wages.\nFortunately, the Supreme Court put the kibosh on those scenarios. In an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court agreed with Jarkesy. The jury is an indispensable bulwark of liberty. As is making sure that your prosecutor isn’t the one paying the judge.\nThe question before the court was what, exactly, is included in “suits at common law.” We know some traditional common-law suits, like fraud, nuisance, and monopolization, for example. But we now live under millions of bureaucratic rules and regulations. Do they count, or does the government get to try you without a jury every time it invents a new one?\nThe court held that whether the government’s case counts as a “suit at common law” depends on whether it resembles any of the traditional suits we know and, more importantly, whether the remedy the government wants is the sort of remedy that courts of law typically give. In Jarkesy’s case, for example, securities fraud is a subspecies of fraud, so the first factor is satisfied. And the government wanted money damages, which is a classic legal remedy, so the second factor is satisfied, too.\nThat’s not quite the end of the analysis, however, because over the years, the court has invented an exception to the Seventh Amendment for “public rights.” Under that exception, if the government’s suit is trying to vindicate a right that the government invented, then no jury is required. The public rights exception has “no textual basis in the Constitution ,” to quote the court, but it is long established in the court’s cases.\nThe question is whether securities fraud involves a public right. The government, and Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson said in a dissenting opinion that a case involves a public right any time the “Government has acted in its sovereign capacity to enforce a new statutory obligation.”\nRoberts and the five remaining justices balked at that expansive rule. Not only is it unsupported by the court’s old public-rights cases, worse, it could “swallow” the Seventh Amendment whole.\nThe majority concluded that public rights include only specific issues identified in those old cases, like collecting revenue, immigration law, and granting public benefits. But fraud, of any sort, is plainly far afield of those, and therefore, you get a jury in fraud cases.\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas , wrote a concurring opinion to recount the historical origins of American juries and how important they are to protecting liberty. They also reminded Americans that we should not undermine important safeguards any time someone unpopular—and Jarkesy may very well have committed securities fraud—finds himself under the government’s thumb. After all, “while incursions on old rights may begin in cases against the unpopular, they rarely end there,” they wrote.\nThe dissenters took a broad interpretation of the court’s prior public-rights cases and then attacked the majority for disagreeing with their interpretation, saying that it “significantly undermines” the rule of law and “prescribes artificial constraints on what modern-day adaptable governance must look like.”\nBut, as Gorsuch points out, that charge is hypocritical. First, the dissenters’ view almost erases the Seventh Amendment in federal cases, which is one of the most important rule-of-law safeguards we have. Second, the dissenters’ broad interpretation is, itself, out-of-step with the old cases. And third, the public-rights exception has no constitutional foundation.\nHow bold to accuse someone of undermining the rule of law while ignoring the law yourself.\nAlthough the ruling forces the SEC to respect a core constitutional right, the decision hardly prevents the SEC from fulfilling its mission. Until the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act in 2010, the SEC always brought its cases in courts rather than in-house tribunals, and it can still do so now. All that has changed is that the people it targets once again benefit from the assurance that the judge isn’t being paid by the prosecutor.\nIt’s only a basic bulwark of liberty, but it’s often good to go back to the basics.",

    "text": "Daphne Koller is an AI pioneer, MacArthur fellow, member of the National Academy of sciences and the founder and CEO of drug discovery and development company insitro. She’ll talk about how attitudes surrounding AI have evolved in her multi-decade career and what's ahead - including how technology is reshaping drug discovery, paving the way for more targeted treatments for the patients who can benefit most. But maximizing AI-powered innovation will depend on better investments in data aggregation, quality and collection and navigating hype cycles that can distract from real impact. This academic-turned-entrepreneur will also share how founding insitro (and a previous company, Coursera) helped her expand her leadership and management skills, all while driving home the importance of shaping a company culture. At insitro, this focus building a culture that works for unique needs led to a special ‘helix’ inspired-structure that helps discovery biologists, automation engineers and others in the company's cross-functional teams keep communication flowing, problem solve, and prevent the siloes that can hold true innovation back. Podcast transcript Linda Lacina, Meet The Leader Welcome to Meet the Leader, a podcast where top leaders share how they're tackling the world's toughest challenges. In today's episode, we talk to Daphne Koller. She is an AI pioneer who is also the founder and CEO of insitro. She'll talk about how AI is driving drug discovery and development there and the big risks and opportunities AI will bring that we should pay attention to right now. Subscribe to Meet the Leader on Apple, Spotify and wherever you get your favorite podcasts. And don't forget to rate and review us. I'm Linda Lacina with the World Economic Forum and this is Meet the Leader. Daphne Koller, insitro We're in the midst of another AI hype cycle. And in this case, I think we're in a different situation because the field has actually delivered tremendous amounts of value, tremendous amounts of impact. But I still worry that the hype sometimes still exceeds even the incredible contribution that has happened. And if we're not careful, we will find ourselves in another AI wintry situation. Linda Lacina, Meet The Leader Daphne Koller is a computer scientist who has been working with AI for a staggering three decades. In fact, she was the first machine learning hire at Stanford University's computer science department . This was a time when the AI community was tiny, just a few hundred and then just a few thousand people strong. Her research dug into things a few people were studying at the time, things like computational medicine and computational biology . She'd go on to win a MacArthur genius grant at just 36. Since those early days, she has seen machine learning do things she didn't think she'd see in her lifetime . Data sets in biology and health have also improved, giving technologists more to work with. Daphne founded insitro in 2018 , all to help harness these new capabilities in machine learning for the life sciences, to discover and develop drugs faster and in a more targeted way than has ever been possible before. AI for Scientific Discovery was named one of our top ten technologies in this year's flagship annual report, and I talked with her about the risks and opportunities it can bring. We also talked about how she has changed as a leader. Insitro wasn't the first company she's founded. She also founded online learning platform Coursera, and she shared what she needed to learn as she transitioned from academia. It's a wide ranging conversation with one of our day's pioneering technologists. We get started with the opportunity that data driven medicine presents. Daphne Koller, insitro One of the big impetuses for the development of the AI technology that we see today is the incredible amount of data that are available in terms of language and images and so on. That data is not really available very much in the life sciences, which is why we've made an investment in generating data at scale. But with that investment, I think the opportunities are actually unlimited. We see our work, AI being able to identify patterns in what's called phenotypic data, which is when you measure a human in different ways using different types of assays. For example, you can do imaging on a person. You can take blood and measure what's in the blood. And there's a tremendous amount of information content that's in those data that a human eye just simply cannot perceive. And we find that with the AI technology that we have available to us today, when you feed it that data, it can see things and understand underlying patterns of disease, underlying causal mechanisms of disease and so on, and really uncover novel ways in which one can intervene in disease and potentially slow it or even revert it. Linda Lacina, Meet The Leader And with this, if it were scaled further, maybe in five years, what would be different? What would be the marked change that we would see? Daphne Koller, insitro So drug discovery is a slow business, partly because it's a regulated industry and for good reason. Because when you put a medicine in a person, you want to make sure you don't kill them. First, do no harm. And so the process by which you first make sure that a medicine is safe and then you figure out the appropriate dosage, and so on, it takes a little bit of time, which is why five years is a little bit short. But I would say that in five years we will certainly see medicines that have a significant AI contribution to the discovery of the medicine being deployed, certainly in clinical development and possibly even in people. I would expect that to happen. I think in ten years -- which is a more interesting timeframe -- we will see much more of the advent of what I like to think of as data-driven medicine, in which currently you have a patient coming in and a doctor basically either deploys some intuition about what drug the person should get, or there is like a very rigid protocol. \"This procedure does X, and you do Y\" with relatively little dependence on the individual factors that are specific to that patient. And I think that in a decade, we will have quantified enough patients and really been able to interrogate the data from those patients to the point that we are able to guide the treatment course of patients and develop new treatments for specific patient populations in a very deliberate way. Linda Lacina, Meet The Leader Are there any specific case studies in insitro you can speak about? Examples of the potential and what you guys are digging in on? Daphne Koller, insitro So let me give one that I think is perhaps most interpretable, which is the work that we're doing in cancer. So every patient who is diagnosed with a solid tumor gets a biopsy sample. The biopsy sample is stained and put under a microscope. And those are called H&E biopsy samples. This is probably the most abundantly collected data modality in clinical care other than things like, you know, EKGs and such. And currently you give what is a multi-billion pixel image to a pathologist. And the pathologist summarizes using three ordinal numbers on a scale of 1 to 3. That is a ridiculous amount of information that is left lying on the table. In the work that we've been able to do, we've been able to show that you could look at one of these images and basically infer from multiple genes in our genome -- whether they're mutated in what is a mutation, whether they are overexpressed beyond their normal level of activity or under-expressed beyond below their level of activity -- All of which gives you a tremendous amount of information about the mechanisms of the pathways that drive the cancer. And so right now we're able to tell you, as, for example, a drug that is targeting a particular protein, where that protein is even active in that patient. And you know what? If it's not, you probably should not be giving that drug to this patient. You probably should be giving them something else. And so right now this information is not accessible to clinicians. And so they're prescribing blindly. And furthermore, because you don't have this information at scale for a large number of patients, you're not able to design drugs in an engineered way, in a systematic way that says these are the subpopulations that we see, and therefore we should be making this drug and not that drug, because it will benefit the largest number of patients. And so that's something that we've been able to show in our work in oncology that I think is truly exciting and could potentially change the way in which oncology drugs are delivered to patients and avoid what is sometimes a multi-month, tortuous journey to find the right drug for a group of patients that do not have months. Linda Lacina, Meet The Leader You talked a little bit about sort of the the opportunity of data-driven medicine. What are some of the risks that we should also keep in mind? Daphne Koller, insitro I think that one of the risks is that the data that one collects in clinical care is often quite noisy and quite dirty. And so garbage in, garbage out is definitely a thing that is still true even in the day of, you know, modern machine learning. In fact, one might say even more predominant because machine learning that is more powerful can identify and hone in on subtle artifacts just as well as it can on subtle signals. So I think that's a really important thing to think about. I think that it's also important to realize that people are not all the same, and there's biases in how data are collected and data are recorded that can often really be quite pernicious. And if they're not appropriately accounted for, can skew the way in which we deliver medicines to patients. We might be thinking that we're doing things in a data driven way, but if we haven't appropriately accounted for all of the covariates, then we can make real mistakes. I'll give you an example: You know, 50% of the world's population are women. Most of the data that are collected and most of the clinical is still very male focused. Because clinical development that involves women is harder because the menstrual cycle causes fluctuations of variations that have to be accounted for. So people follow the easy path. And as a consequence, a lot of drugs are just considerably less effective for women than they are for men. And so I think if you don't appropriately account and stratify for that, then you can make decisions that will actually be detrimental to patients. Linda Lacina, Meet The Leader Do you see that there are certain blind spots for leaders of any stripe when it comes to just AI in general. Daphne Koller, insitro I think probably the biggest blind spot is thinking that AI is this magic wand that you wave it on top of a pile of data and magic will come out. And unfortunately, the input needs to be of high quality enough that the magic wand actually produces something of value. And so I think people are not investing nearly as much as they should in data collection, data aggregation, data quality in order to make sure that the AI has the right input to work on. People are not investing nearly as much as they should in data collection, data aggregation, data quality in order to make sure that the AI has the right input to work on. ”Linda Lacina, Meet The Leader And are there certain questions that businesses, leaders should be asking themselves to kind of make sure that they're on that right path, that they're in the right mindset when they're going forth with that data? Daphne Koller, insitro So the first thing that we do when we look at a pile of data is we do some simple statistical correlations just to see whether things that shouldn't be correlated actually are correlated with each other. So for example, if data are collected from multiple batches and multiple days, how correlated are certain outcome measurements with the day in which the data was collected or the machine on which they were collected on? So a simple statistical test like that often reveals significant artifacts that one needs to correct for. And then maybe on the other side, demographics of patients to basically see whether certain outcomes are correlated with race and age and gender, which they inevitably are. And so just making sure that you're appropriately accounting for those covariates, those are some things that we do. So that's on the input side. On the output side, once you've trained the model, it's really important to make sure that your model generalizes in the right way. So oftentimes people just test the model on the data that they use to train the model. That is an absolute no-no in machine learning. And the less sophisticated people don't always think about really keeping your test data entirely separate and ideally from an entirely separate cohort. So, for example, if you're doing something for clinical care, you want to train potentially on the data from some number of hospitals and test on a completely different hospital, which will ensure that you have really addressed these -- really come up with something that is truly general, as opposed to focusing on the specifics of the population that used for training. Those are some of the metrics that I think people should be applying. And it's not just in healthcare, it's in every challenging AI application. Linda Lacina, Meet The Leader What keeps you up at night when it comes to knowing that this is the big buzzword? Everyone's talking about AI, regardless of how much they read in on it, right? There's sort of a little bit of a sophistication you need to have where you're getting this stuff, how you're using it, and that can upend the whole thing, especially when it comes to how hospitals, patients, doctors, whether they trust these tools, like tell me a little bit about that. Daphne Koller, insitro So in general, I have a deep aversion to hype cycles. And I think hype cycles, which have happened multiple times in the journey of this field, have been incredibly detrimental and caused several of what are called AI winters, when the field made extravagant promises that did not come true in the timelines that people made them for. And what caused this disillusionment is like, \"oh, this is all just a bunch of hooey, and I'm just going to go and put my money or my time into something else.\" When I graduated from my PhD at Stanford, you couldn't say you were doing AI. It was considered too fringe, or as my teenage daughter likes to call it: \"suss.\" And, you know, because we were just coming out of an AI winter that had been created by exactly that. You used to have to say you were doing cognitive computing or computational learning theory or anything that was not AI. Now, of course, we're in the midst of another AI hype cycle. And in this case, I think we're in a different situation because the field has actually delivered tremendous amounts of value, tremendous amounts of impact. But I still worry that the hype sometimes still exceeds even the incredible contribution that has happened. And if we're not careful, we will find ourselves in another sort of AI, maybe a wintry situation. And that's going to be hugely detrimental to the field again. So I think people should be balanced in how they talk about the technology. Being optimistic, but still being balanced about where we are relative to the challenges. We're in the midst of another AI hype cycle. And in this case, I think we're in a different situation because the field has actually delivered tremendous amounts of value, tremendous amounts of impact. But I still worry that the hype sometimes still exceeds even the incredible contribution that has happened ”Linda Lacina, Meet The Leader Are there tells that you're in an AI hype cycle, a way that people can recognize, \"oh no, like I think I've been taken over by a trend, by a fever,\" as opposed to maybe solving an actual problem. Daphne Koller, insitro Yeah. So I think there are a number of those. So first of all, it's when everyone who last week was a data scientist is now an AI expert. They are not. It's a skill that one needs to learn. So you need to be watchful that that it's when the valuation of a company goes up by 30 or 40%, when they're fundraising, simply by having an AI slide and slide four of their dek. So both of these are, I think, important tells. And I think it's important that as one encounters individuals or companies that are claiming to do AI and solve AI problems, to actually ask them, where does your data come from? What AI technologies do you deploy? What is the skill set and the experience in this space that your team has, you know, how long have they been working on this? And you will find that there's a lot of organizations that once you start kind of poking at it, there is very little substance underneath, whereas there are many that do. And so I think it's important to kind of winnow the wheat from the chaff as you're talking to organizations because it's a bandwagon, and everyone's jumping on it. Linda Lacina, Meet The Leader How do you think that you have changed as a leader in the course of your career? Is there something that you do now that you would not have done maybe at the beginning? Daphne Koller, insitro I think the first one is recognizing that leadership and management is a skill, just actually the two different skills that are things that you need to learn. Like many tech people, STEM people tend to grow up valuing the hard sciences, the hard technology as the skills that are important. And then when you go into business for the first time, as I did when I left Stanford to found Coursera, you don't really appreciate the quote soft skills and just how important those are, and that you need to learn them and you get better at doing them, by deliberate practice, by learning from others. And so I think that, to me, was an important realization that it wasn't just about the hard skills. It was at least as much about the other skills: how to lead, how to manage, how to coach, how to grow people, how to give feedback, things like that. I think the second one that was really profound to me was the importance of culture. When I started Coursera, I had just come out of academia. I've been an academic actually my entire life. I'd never been at a company far less building a company, and a relatively senior potential recruit asked me, you know, as the Coursera co-founder and co-CEO, what would you like the culture here to be in? I kind of internally scratched my head saying, what is culture and why do you need it? You come to work, you do your work, you go home go home. I mean, what's culture? I think I learned how important that was in the Coursera days because of some things that we accidentally did right. Other things that we, by neglect didn't do right, and that was quite profound and so on. And so at insitro, I took a very deliberate, very thoughtful view on building culture. And I think that has served us incredibly well, especially in a time of great change and great potential turmoil that results from the change, including the rapid growth of a company. Having a very deliberate mindset on culture is absolutely critical. Having a very deliberate mindset on culture is absolutely critical. ”Linda Lacina, Meet The Leader And within that culture, what are 1 or 2 things that you're really proud that you guys have built in and so other people can learn? What are those things that you think are like, gosh, those are key. Daphne Koller, insitro So, insitro is very much a cross-disciplinary company. We have everything from, you know, life sciences, we're discovery biologists, we have automation engineers, we have machine learning scientists, we have software engineers. We have such a huge breadth of disciplines of people who normally do not talk to each other, cannot communicate with each other effectively, not because either of them is a bad person. It's simply the language. The jargon are different, but also the mindsets are different. The mindset of a discovery scientist versus the mindset of an engineer, they just think about the world in very different ways. And one of the things that we put in place from the very beginning is a set of expectations about how people interact with each other and engage with each other in order to take that very disparate group of individuals and create a cohesive culture that creates two cross-disciplinary thinking and ideation. And what we've found consistently is because of this culture that we've put forward. It's not only that we come up with better solutions -- we do -- but we also come up with better problems that people would not think about if they were working in a siloed approach. And so this culture that we've put in place has both elements of expectations and how one people interacts. But there are also org structural consequences. So for example, all of our projects are done via cross-functional teams that involve people from different disciplines working together. So you can think of it as a version of a matrix or the helix, however you'd like to think about it, that incurs a certain cost in terms of the need to coordinate across functions in ways that a standard hierarchical structure doesn't impose. But we felt so strongly that if you had a hierarchical structure with the corresponding silos, then we wouldn't build the kind of company that we wanted to build. Linda Lacina, Meet The Leader You mentioned that there are either solutions as well as, you know, interesting problems to tackle that you were able to discover. What's an example of one of those that kind of helps people understand, hey, this is where you could go with this. Daphne Koller, insitro So I think coming back to one of the examples that I gave earlier, the ability to take data from histopathology images and from that readout molecular covariates and then relate them to clinical outcomes is something that requires both the ability to understand what machine learning can do with images, which oftentimes is just like magic to a typical, you know, cancer biologist. But it also requires someone who can come in and say, you know, all of the many things that you can read from these histology images. These are the ones that matter. So let's focus on reading those as opposed to the other things. If you just had the machine learning scientists on the one side, they would probably say, \"oh, look, I can read this and I can read this and I can read this,\" and maybe these wouldn't be the things that matter. And on the other hand, if you just had the life scientists, they probably wouldn't even imagine. They wouldn't even imagine that you can read these kinds of signals from images. I mean, really, you can read gene activity level just by looking at a bunch of fixed cells of of histopathology images on a slide. I mean, how could you possibly do that? And it's really bringing those two groups of people together that gave us this \"Aha moment\" of this is a really important problem that technology can help solve. Linda Lacina, Meet The Leader You are a woman in tech. There's now senior women in tech senior roles. What is a way that you either help coach sponsors, support women to kind of stay in technology? What do you do that you swear by or that you think is a great practice? Daphne Koller, insitro It is really hard to be a woman in tech. Unfortunately, even today, I mean, when I started, it was typically the case that I was the only woman in the room. And I'm sorry to say that even today, I'm often maybe not the only woman in the room, but there might be 1 or 2 others. And it does create a certain feeling of loneliness and being put on the spot and a real sort of need to represent the gender, so to speak, and that makes it kind of a little bit overwhelming at times. One of the things that I would suggest to anyone, not only a senior woman, but to anyone who's an ally, is to watch out for the many situations where women are put on the spot, not just women, people of disadvantaged backgrounds. So, for example, it is very common for women again, even today, that there is a group of people around the table, ideating. And a woman says something and the conversation just slips on. And then five minutes later, a man says the exact same thing and everyone's like, \"John, what a great idea.\" And if you're the woman who made that comment, I mean, there's no good solution for you because you can say, hey, I said that and you look like a, you know, credit-grabbing, kind of petty type person, or you can let it go and never get credit for your ideas. Neither of these is great. If you're in the room and you're catching that and you can then say, \"oh yeah, John, that's great. Thank you for amplifying Sally's idea from a few moments ago.\" And it is a non aggressive way to highlight that. Sally made that same comment. And I think that is something that all of us could be helpful to women in raising their confidence, raising their credibility and raising the recognition for credit. Linda Lacina, Meet The Leader Is there a piece of advice that you've received that you've just been grateful for? Daphne Koller, insitro There is a number. There's many. But I would highlight one that I found useful, both in understanding myself and in understanding others. For example, in coaching situations or even in interaction with anyone, which is that oftentimes our areas for development are our strengths taken into extremes. So, oftentimes when you have something that you're really good at. You end up overusing it and that ends up being minus. And that's certainly something that I found for myself in cases, for example. I've been considered as very good at ideating and, you know, coming up with new ideas. When you overuse that and you're not careful in how you use that, especially if you're in a position of authority, every new idea somehow miraculously spawns a project that an entire team is working on, even if that was just really not your intent. Your intent was just to say, \"oh, this is a really interesting thing.\" And so being very conscientious of what your strengths are and not overusing them. And then also the same is true for others. You sometimes see people like why are they doing that? That's just such a horrible thing. And you realize that this is just like their strength, but taken to extremes. It makes you more empathetic and more able to give them feedback that will actually be received in the right way. Linda Lacina, Meet The Leader There's so many AI tools that people are using in their regular life. I think it'd be very interesting to know your perspective. Are there AI tools that you use that have surprised you at how practical they are to making your life better, faster, stronger? Daphne Koller, insitro So I will give two. 0ne that dates back even before the latest generative AI sort of cycle that we're experiencing is the power of machine translation. One of the barriers to communication with people from backgrounds different from your own is often that they speak a different language. And I found that even the previous generations of machine translation were just functional. You could get an email from someone in German. Then when you don't speak German and be able to pretty much understand what it said and respond in English and have that translate into German, it was amazing. So that, to me, is a huge one. I think there's a bunch of fun ones, like what you could do with images, both, you know, finding images and creating images. But maybe the last one that I would give is just like the ability of tools, like the large language models, ChatGPT and others, to create and dialogue around complicated content in ways that are intelligible and meet you where you are. So if you want to have a conversation at the level of a high school student, you can do that. If you want to do it at the level of a, you know, elementary school student, you can do that if you want to do it at the level of a PhD, you could do that, too. And it's the same content, but they're able to kind of generate a dialog that anyone can relate to. And I think that is going to be one of the most transformative things for everyone, from researchers to education because it allows everyone to have an interactive experience around complicated stuff that is tailored to who they are. And I think that is one of the most important things that we can do for people. Linda Lacina, Meet The Leader What do you think leaders should prioritize now? Daphne Koller, insitro I think we're at a time of incredible technological opportunity, and that technological opportunity can be deployed in ways that are beneficial to humanity or not so beneficial. And that is certainly the case. I mean, certainly, if you're in industries that are the social good industries, but even in any other industry, you can think about the downstream secondary consequences of the actions that you take in deploying that technology and really be mindful of how you can do it in a way that overall increases societal good. And when you're at times like this, where you are on this exponential curve, small actions can have large downstream consequences because they get amplified over time. So I would encourage people to be really thoughtful and how they're deploying technology so as to optimize for maximum benefit to humanity. Linda Lacina, Meet The Leader That was Daphne Koller.

    "text": "India vs SA | Rohit: We were not good enough to win 1st Test Centurion, Dec 28 (PTI) India skipper Rohit Sharma had no qualms about admitting that his team was simply not good enough to challenge South Africa, putting the blame for the embarrassing innings and 32 run loss in the first Test on the lack of collective effort. India put up a shoddy show both with bat and ball as they were bundled out for 131 in 34.1 overs in their second innings after they allowed South Africa to score 408 in 108.4 overs in their first essay. The visitors had scored 245 in the first innings. \"We were not good enough to win. Having been put in to bat, KL (Rahul) batted well to get us that score but then we didn't exploit the conditions with the ball and then again didn't show up today with the bat,\" said Rohit during the post-match presentation. \"If we have to win Test matches, we have to come together collectively and we didn't do that. Guys have come here before, we know what to expect and everyone has their own plan. \"Our batters were challenged and we didn't adapt well. This is a boundary-scoring ground, we saw them score many but we need to understand the opposition and their strengths as well. We didn't bat well in both innnings, that's why we stand here.\" The India skipper struggled to find much positives with the match ending inside three days. \"Not too many positives to finish the game within three days, but KL showed what we need to do on this sort of pitch,\" he said. KL Rahul had scored a century in the first innings. \"Our bowlers, a lot of these guys haven't been here before so I don't want to be too critical. \"Important for us to regroup, we go through these times as sportsmen and we need to be ready for the next Test now.\" Playing his last international series, Dean Elgar slammed a magnificent 185 and the opener termed it a \"special\" knock and highlighted his partnerships with Tony de Zorzi (28) and Marco Jansen (84). \"Pretty special knock. Sometimes what we want to do hasn't worked out as plans, but happy that it worked today. I think you need to keep things nice and simple, the game is already pretty complex,\" said the 36-year-old, who was adjudged the Player of the Match. \"Focus on the ball, play nice and straight. Play late and be great. You got to ride the roller when it is in your favour. \"Good partnerships with Tony, and then Jansen showed his talent as well. You need fast bowlers and a spinner potentially to take 20 wickets, that's how we win Test matches.\" Proteas pace trio of Nandre Burger (4/33), Kagiso Rabada (2/32) and Marco Jansen (3/36) smothered the visitors with a disciplined attack as India folded for 131 in 34.1 overs. \"(Rabada) KG was brilliant, but then Nandre showed why he has been such a shining light for South African cricket,\" Elgar said. \"You can't win a two-Test series if you don't win the first one, the Indians are difficult to beat. \"We'll have a few days out to relax and enjoy this. We were pretty clinical, our fielding wasn't the best and we didn't make it too easy for ourselves at times.\" PTI",

    "text": "Crystal Palace are considering replacing Roy Hodgson with Steve Cooper Officials believe they would not have to pay compensation to old side Forest Chris Sutton and Ian Ladyman give their best sporting moments of the year on It's All Kicking Off\nCrystal Palace believe they are clear to appoint Steve Cooper without paying compensation to Nottingham Forest amid growing uncertainty over Roy Hodgson’s position.\nHowever, Palace could face difficulty convincing Cooper to make a quick return to management following his City Ground departure last week, with sources indicating the Welshman is minded to take a short break from football.\nHodgson’s role is under scrutiny after eight games without a win, and Saturday’s match against Brentford is crucial for his prospects. Defeat could prove the final straw for Palace chiefs.\nMail Sport understands there is already a feeling among members of the club’s hierarchy that a change is needed. Others are reluctant to part ways with the highly-respected boss before the summer.\nCooper’s sacking at Forest last week has become a factor as Palace contemplate their next move.\nCrystal Palace believe they are clear to appoint ex-Forest boss Steve Cooper without paying compensation\nPalace chiefs – led by chairman Steve Parish (R) – feel that a change may be needed after eight games without a win under Roy Hodgson (L)\nYour browser does not support iframes.\nThe former Swansea manager is admired at Palace and has long been viewed as a potential successor to 76-year-old Hodgson.\nIt is understood Cooper is not subject to a period of gardening leave by Forest, meaning he can be appointed by his next club without a compensation fee.\nPalace chiefs had hoped Hodgson would see out the season before the club appointed a younger manager to implement a new approach.\nIf Palace lose to Brentford in their next game it will only pile the pressure on Hodgson\nBut Cooper’s availability, coupled with the team’s poor form, may force Palace into accelerating their vision, though that will depend on whether the 44-year-old is open to returning to work.\nIpswich boss Kieran McKenna also features on Palace’s list of candidates to replace Hodgson, while assistant manager Paddy McCarthy has impressed as part of the backroom team and could be elevated to the top job on a short-term basis.",

    "text": "Campus UPO CArmona\nLos jefes de servicio del Virgen del Rocío se plantan ante la huelga de anestesistas: \"Están creando una falsa alarma\"\nLos directores de todas las Unidades de Gestión Clínica del hospital firman una carta en la que manifiestan su desacuerdo con los paros y el apoyo a la reorganización del sector por parte de la dirección\nCCOO denuncia que en el primer día con un anestesista menos, cuatro mujeres tuvieron que parir con dolor\nLa huelga de los anestesistas en Sevilla hace saltar las alarmas: \"Habrá momentos en que alguna epidural tendrá que esperar\"\nLos directores de todas las Unidades de Gestión Clínica del Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocío han hecho llegar a este periódico una carta para mostrar públicamente su firme desacuerdo con la huelga de anestesistas que se lleva a cabo desde el 30 de junio hasta el 6 de julio en el Hospital de la Mujer, la cual cuenta con el apoyo del Sindicato Médico de Sevilla (SMS).\nLa huelga ha sido convocada en protesta por la decisión de la dirección del hospital de reubicar a uno de los tres anestesistas de guardia durante el horario de 20:00 horas a 8:00 los días laborables, y durante 24 horas los fines de semana y festivos. El objetivo de esta medida, según la dirección, es incrementar la cirugía programada.\nLos profesionales firmantes justifican esta reorganización con datos que revelan una disminución significativa de la actividad en el Hospital de la Mujer desde 2008. \"De acuerdo con el cuadro de mandos del hospital, el número de partos se ha reducido un 50,9%, pasando de 25,3 al día en 2008 a 12,4 en 2024. Las cesáreas también han descendido un 32,1%, de 4,98 a 3,38 diarias en el mismo periodo. La suma total de partos y cesáreas ha caído un 45,5%, de 30,28 a 16,8 al día en 2024\", recoge literalmente el escrito.\nFrente a estas cifras, la reubicación de anestesistas representa una reducción del 16,7% los días laborables y un 33,3% los fines de semana y festivos. Los directores subrayan que ambos porcentajes \"están muy por debajo de la caída del 45,5% de la actividad en 2024\", lo que demuestra la \"necesidad de la reorganización\". Además, aseguran que esta medida no es un recorte, sino \"una optimización de recursos que permitirá incrementar la actividad quirúrgica en enfermedades prioritarias como el cáncer\".\nEn contraste con esta información verificable, los participantes en la huelga y el SMS han difundido, según el comunicado, \"información sin datos en la que acusan gravemente a la dirección de deteriorar la calidad y poner en riesgo la seguridad, creando una falsa alarma social\". \"Es una huelga injustificada que sí pone en peligro la seguridad de las pacientes esta semana\", enfatizan.\nCon este golpe sobre la mesa, los directores buscan informar a la población de su apoyo a la decisión de la dirección del hospital. El comunicado está firmado por todos los Directores de Unidad de Gestión Clínica del Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocío, incluyendo a profesionales de gran calado social como José Miguel Cisneros Herreros, Javier Salvador Bofill o Javier Padillo Ruiz, entre muchos otros, reafirmando un respaldo unánime a la medida.\n\"Un criterio economicista\"\nPara los sindicatos, la visión es otra. Según alerta CCOO, \"en el primer día con un anestesista menos, cuatro mujeres tuvieron que parir con dolor en el Hospital de la Mujer\". En un comunicado, el sindicato hace balance de los primeros tres días de huelga. \"Rechazamos las soluciones que desde la dirección médica se quieren imponer. En primer lugar, que se avise al personal de anestesia de otros servicios que deberá desplazarse desde otro edificio y desatender su expectativa de actividad original y en segundo lugar que sean los médicos residentes, sin supervisión, quienes apliquen las anestesias epidurales\", asevera CCOO.\nPara el sindicato, que cuatro mujeres hayan tenido que dar a luz \"sin epidural como hace casi siglo y medio\" es consecuencia de \"haber estado los dos anestesistas que quedaban de guardia ocupados en intervenciones quirúrgicas urgentes\". \"Los hechos demuestran que la reducción de un anestesista de guardia no tiene nada que ver con las necesidades asistenciales, sino pura y simplemente con un criterio economicista de ahorro, a costa de las mujeres\", sentencia CCOO.",
