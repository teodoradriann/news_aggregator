    "text": "Nestled amidst the emerald embrace of Long Island, Studio Khora rises as an exemplar of architectural alchemy, transforming modernist tenets into contemporary masterpieces.\nThe Pavilion house is a beacon of sustainable living, mirrors the ethos of top Long Island architects , marrying innovation with environmental stewardship. In an age where sustainability is not just a choice but a necessity, Studio Khora's design is a clarion call for the future of New York and Long Island's residential landscape.\nStudio Khora, distinguished among Long Island architects, has sculpted a space that resonates with Mies van der Rohe's minimalist spirit while speaking the complex visual language of Derrida's deconstruction. Here, form and function engage in a delicate dance, creating a living experience that transcends the confines of traditional architecture.\nThis house is not a mere dwelling but a vessel of light and air, a canvas where nature's palette unfurls in splendor. The architectural language of this Long Island jewel is a dialogue of contrasts, where Mies’s transparent simplicity meets the intricate layers of Derrida's philosophy.\nStudio Khora has adeptly translated these dialogues into a home that stands as a manifesto of fluidity, with glass expanses inviting the outside in, fostering a seamless bond with the land. In this space, contemplation and connection flourish, nurtured by the tranquil cadence of coastal life.\nThe narrative crafted by Studio Khora goes beyond aesthetic allure; it's an urgent response to the climatic challenges facing New York and Long Island.

In this Long Island haven, sustainability is not an afterthought but the cornerstone of its creation. Studio Khora has reimagined the essence of coastal living, proving that luxury and environmental consciousness can coexist. The house's design is a bold step towards a greener, more resilient New York, where each structure not only shelters but also preserves and inspires.\nABOUT STUDIO KHORA\n[ STUDIO KHORA ] is a multidisciplinary design collaborative of visionary architects, lighting and interior designers, landscape architects, and builders engaged to deconstruct the traditional patterns of spatial design.

    "text": "Dear Microsoft Customer Support,\nI hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction and frustration with a recent incident involving Microsoft Outlook, which has resulted in the loss of access to my wallet.\nOn 23/01/2023, I attempted to set up Outlook on my Android device. During the setup process, I was prompted to create a PIN for security purposes. Regrettably, without clearly indicating the consequences, Microsoft enforced the PIN I set for Outlook as the default access to my phone. Subsequently, when attempting to access the Outlook app, I mistakenly entered the wrong PIN, leading to an unforeseen change in my phone's access method.\nThis situation is entirely unacceptable, as at no point during the setup process was it communicated that changing my PIN in Outlook would impact the method of accessing my phone. This lack of transparency has resulted in severe consequences for me, including the loss of access to essential financial resources stored in my wallet.\nIn light of the distressing circumstances caused by this oversight, I am seeking financial compensation from Microsoft to cover the losses I have incurred. I believe it is essential for Microsoft to take responsibility for the serious mistake in the setup process and the subsequent impact on my personal and financial well-being.\nIf a satisfactory resolution is not reached promptly, I feel compelled to share my unfortunate experience on various social media platforms, ensuring that the public is made aware of the potential risks associated with downloading Outlook onto their devices.\nI kindly request that Microsoft thoroughly investigates this matter and provides compensation for the financial losses and inconvenience I have experienced. I expect a swift and fair resolution to this issue.\nPlease contact me at your earliest convenience to discuss the details further and to provide information on the steps Microsoft plans to take to rectify this situation.\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\nSincerely,\nJorge",

    "text": "Nesta terça-feira (16), foi sancionada na Assembleia Legislativa do Paraná (Alep) a lei que reconhece Nossa Senhora do Rocio como padroeira do Estado do Paraná . Com a nova legislação, o calendário do estado passa a incluir oficialmente o Dia da Padroeira do Paraná, celebrado em 15 de novembro.\nAlém do aspecto religioso, o reconhecimento da padroeira representa um marco civil e histórico para os paranaenses. “Há décadas a devoção a Nossa Senhora do Rocio é celebrada com intensidade, especialmente em Paranaguá, cidade sede do Santuário Estadual dedicado à Santa. Agora, essa fé passa a ter reconhecimento oficial e legal no âmbito do Estado”, afirmou o deputado Anibelli Neto, autor do projeto que deu origem à Lei nº 22.360/2025.\nA proposta do deputado também busca reconhecer a Procissão Solene em homenagem à padroeira, realizada em Paranaguá, como Patrimônio Cultural e Imaterial do Paraná. A procissão integra a Festa de Nossa Senhora do Rocio, considerada a maior manifestação religiosa da região Sul do Brasil. Com o tema “Com a Mãe do Rocio aos Pés da Cruz”, a organização realizará a 212ª edição da festa entre os dias 6 e 15 de novembro deste ano.\nRelação de Nossa Senhora do Rocio com o Paraná Do latim, Rocio significa “orvalho”, que simbolicamente representa as bênçãos e graças recebidas das mãos de Nossa Senhora do Rocio. O culto à Santa no Paraná tem origem no século XVII, com registros datados de 1648. Em 1977, o Paraná tornou-se o primeiro estado brasileiro a ter uma padroeira oficialmente reconhecida pelo Vaticano, por meio do Papa Paulo VI.\nReceba Notícias no seu WhatsApp!

    "text": "The Lawrence Police Department has suspended a city nightclub’s license to operate days after a deadly shooting early Christmas Eve morning.\nActing Chief William Castro on Wednesday suspended Energy Lounge’s license as the shooting that killed 29-year-old Edward Javier-Perez remains under investigation, with the suspects still at large.\n“The Acting Chief has determined that in the interest of public safety, the City must close the establishment and suspend the establishment’s license to operate until such time that the investigation is complete,” Det. Thomas M. Cuddy stated in a release Thursday.\n“This immediate action is being taken on an expedited basis due to the overriding public safety concern,” Cuddy added.\nAuthorities on Tuesday identified Javier-Perez as the victim shot and killed at Energy Lounge early Sunday morning.\nPolice responded to the nightclub at 459 Broadway around 12:20 a.m., finding Javier-Perez suffering from an apparent gunshot wound, according to the Essex District Attorney’s Office.\nMedical personnel pronounced Javier-Perez dead after he was rushed to Lawrence General Hospital.\n“Energy Lounge deeply regrets the human loss and we send our most sincere condolences and prayers to the victim’s relatives,” the business said in an Instagram post the day of the shooting. “We accompany them in their pain.”\nThe establishment will remain closed until further notice, and once authorities complete the investigation, the Lawrence Licensing Board will be fed the information and determine whether to hold a hearing regarding the shooting.\nIn its Instagram post, Energy Lounge said it was “actively cooperating with the authorities.”\n“We infinitely appreciate the interest of all people, assiduous visitors to our restaurant and friends to come closer and offer us their support and trust in such a difficult time,” the post read. We reiterate the commitment and responsibility to ensure a safe and healthy environment in our establishment.”",

No Brasil, aproximadamente cinco milhões de carros foram convocados para recall visando a substituição gratuita desses airbags defeituosos.\nContudo, cerca de metade dos proprietários não atenderam ao chamado, incluindo o veículo envolvido no acidente fatal.\nPosicionamento da Honda\nA Honda, fabricante do automóvel, lamentou o ocorrido e afirmou estar tentando [contato com os proprietários dos veículos afetados](https://www.metropoles.com/brasil/25-mi-carros-airbag-defeituoso) pelos recalls do airbag. “A Honda lamenta profundamente o ocorrido e permanece à disposição das autoridades. A empresa esclarece que, até o momento, não tinha conhecimento do ocorrido”, esclareceu, em nota.\n“A Honda continua a convocar proprietários de veículos afetados pelos recalls do insuflador de airbags Takata por diversos meios de contato, inclusive cartas direcionadas aos proprietários, solicitando aos clientes dos modelos envolvidos que levem, com urgência, seus veículos a uma concessionária autorizada para a substituição do insuflador”, continua a nota.\nAirbags Takata\nOs airbags da Takata utilizam nitrato de amônio para inflar. Embora o nitrato seja relativamente estável, a exposição prolongada ao calor e à umidade pode comprometer sua integridade. A montagem defeituosa permite a infiltração de umidade, corroendo componentes metálicos que, ao se romperem durante a ativação do airbag, transformam-se em projéteis letais.\nDiversas montadoras utilizaram os[ airbags da Takata nas primeiras décadas dos anos 2000](https://www.metropoles.com/distrito-federal/veja-o-que-diz-a-toyota-sobre-morte-mulher-apos-explosao-de-airbag). Após o registro de fatalidades, inúmeros recalls foram emitidos globalmente.\nNo Brasil, 15 marcas de automóveis foram envolvidas nesses recalls, incluindo Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Fiat-Chrysler, Mitsubishi, Mercedes-Benz e BMW.",

La Policía de Nicaragua ha detenido a los sacerdores Carlos Avilés y Héctor Treminio, vicario general y tesorero de la arquidiócesis de Managua Tiempo de lectura: 2’ El obispo auxiliar de Managua, Silvio Báez, a quien el Papa Francisco ordenó dejar Nicaragua en 2019 por motivos de seguridad, se declaró este jueves indignado por los arrestos de tres sacerdotes de la Arquidiócesis de Managua, en medio de tensiones entre el Gobierno del presidente Daniel Ortega y la Iglesia católica. \"Me indigna el injusto secuestro de tres queridos sacerdotes de Managua de parte de la criminal dictadura sandinista: P. Pablo Villafranca, Mons. Carlos Aviles y P. Héctor Treminio, pastores y profetas\", escribió Báez, muy crítico con el Gobierno de Ortega en Nicaragua, en su cuenta del X (antes Twitter). — Silvio José Báez (@silviojbaez) [#Nicaragua]. Me indigna el injusto secuestro de tres queridos sacerdotes de Managua de parte de la criminal dictadura sandinista: P. Pablo Villafranca, Mons. Carlos Aviles y P. Héctor Treminio, pastores y profetas. ¡Le pido a Dios que los proteja y sean liberados de inmediato! [December 29, 2023] Báez, quien reside en Miami y a quien las autoridades declararon \"traidor a la patria\" y despojaron de su nacionalidad, pidió a Dios proteger a los sacerdotes encarcelados y demandó que \"sean liberados de inmediato\". La Policía de Nicaragua detuvo este jueves a los sacerdores Carlos Avilés y Héctor Treminio, vicario general y tesorero de la Arquidiócesis de Managua, respectivamente. Días atrás también detuvo al párroco Pablo Villafranca. La \"mafia\" de la Iglesia El cardenal nicaragüense y arzobispo de Managua, Leopoldo Brenes, aún no se pronuncia sobre la detención de sus tres sacerdotes. Las relaciones del Gobierno de Ortega y la Iglesia católica viven momentos de gran tensión, marcadas por la expulsión y encarcelamiento de sacerdotes, la prohibición de actividades religiosas, y la suspensión de sus relaciones diplomáticas. El Gobierno de Nicaragua excarceló en octubre pasado a 12 sacerdotes y los envió al Vaticano, aunque entre esos religiosos no se encontraba el obispo Rolando Álvarez, condenado en febrero pasado a más de 26 años de prisión por \"traición a la patria\", tras negarse entonces a ser expulsado de Nicaragua hacia Estados Unidos junto a otros 222 presos políticos. También fue privado de su nacionalidad. Ortega ha calificado como una \"mafia\" a la Iglesia y ha declarado interrumpidas las relaciones con el Vaticano.",

    "title": "USWNT player grades: Olympic performance against Zambia was only perfect for a minute | Sporting News United Kingdom",
    "text": "When is a 3-0 victory in a major world soccer tournament not a triumph? A. When the opposition team sits nearly 60 positions lower in the FIFA rankings? B. When the opposition spends more than half the game down a player? C. When your expected goals (xG) figure is just a shade under 5? D. All of the above. Yes, I made that question too easy. Because as we saw with the United States women’s national team in their Olympic opener Thursday in Nice, it is possible to blunder even in such a circumstance. The USWNT, ranked No. 5 in the world, earned a 3-0 win over world No. 64 Zambia in the first game of Group B competition, which leads into a much more challenging second game Sunday in Marseilles against No. 4 Germany. New coach Emma Hayes did open her major tournament record with a shutout win, and some of the passing sequences in the first half made it look like she’s been teaching this group plenty about how to create chances. Now, can they finish a better percentage? Onto the player ratings. 2024 PARIS OLYMPICS Full Olympics schedule | How to watch in USA | Meet NBC's broadcasters Who graded well for the USWNT? Alyssa Naeher (goalkeeper): 7 What’s a fair grade for a keeper given literally nothing to do? She was credited with a few saves, but none of those was a serious opportunity. Emily Fox (right back): 5.5 There was minimal responsibility defensively because she was played in advanced position so much of the match. She had a glaring chance to make it 4-0 late in the game, but her shot was blocked. Naomi Girma (central defender): 8.5 Once again, Girma was flawless, and it’s not that she didn’t have anything necessary to do. She shut down at least three breakaway opportunities for Zambia’s gifted Barbra Banda by hustling into position and calmly knocking the ball clear. Zambia had little possession when they had 11 players, and it only dwindled when they went down to 10 players, but there were moments when Zambia managed to get free on the break. BEST U.S. OLYMPIANS Top 33 rankings | Simone Biles | Katie Ledecky | Jesse Owens Tierna Davidson (central defender): 6.5 Before the U.S had established its dominance of the game, long before they found themselves with one more player than the opponent, Davidson was beaten badly down the right side and chose to foul to stop the attack. That led to a dangerous free kick for Zambia and could have put them in a 1-0 hole. Hayes has decided she likes what Davidson brings at the central position opposite Girma, but she still has work to do to erase the memory of her penalty foul against Canada in the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. Crystal Dunn (left back): 5.5 Dunn began the game at left back but was given the opportunity to advance to her favored position up front after substitutions were made. In the 89th minute, Dunn had a perfect chance to put an extra goal onto the lead for the purpose of goal differential and goals scored – the first two tiebreakers in the group stage. But a perfect cross that created an uncontested header at the right post was botched. Dunn’s attempt went three feet wide of the goal. Sam Coffey (defensive midfielder): 6 Coffey had little activity in the middle defensively, as the limited Zambia attacks came mostly down the left side. When given opportunities to get on the ball early in the game, she looked a smidge nervous and was too eager to play the ball backward. But against Zambia’s 10-player group, she grew more comfortable getting into the attack, including the foul she drew in the 76th minute in a dangerous spot above the box. Lindsey Horan (midfielder) 7.5 Horan made some brilliant passes in this game, including those that led to goals. Much like the team as a whole, however, she does have a tendency to leave you wanting more. Perhaps if she’d been able to continue to explore her connection with longtime midfield partner Rose Lavelle, things would have gone better for the U.S. in the second half. Rose Lavelle (attacking midfielder) 6.5 Coming off a pre-tournament injury, there was no need for Lavelle to go longer than a half given the 3-0 halftime score. She was not at her absolute best, as she flubbed a threatening free kick opportunity after Pauline Zulu committed the foul just outside the box that led to her red-card disqualification. But she also put in a beautiful corner kick in the 15th minute that led to a header by Horan that was cleared off the line, and Lavelle’s pass to Smith set up the third USWNT goal. Sophia Smith (forward): 7 Smith was terrific during the 40 minutes she played, including her alert pounce on a turnover that led to Rodman heading a perfect cross off the bar and then two plays that did produce goals: her find of Lindsey Horan, who then assisted on Mal Swanson’s first goal, and then the direct assist on Swanson’s second. But she exited with an injury. The USWNT has had a terrible time staying healthy around big tournaments lately, including an injury that robbed them of Catarina Macario for this tournament after she missed two full years. They need Smith to be OK as this tournament continues. MORE: Latest news, updates on Sophia Smith injury Mallory Swanson (forward): 8.5 Swanson made her first Olympic appearance in 2016, when she was taken to Rio as a teenager and given considerable playing time. But this marked her first major impact on this stage. She turned a 1-0 lead into 3-0 with two beautiful goals in the space of a minute. There could have been a hat trick, but her best chance in the second half was misspent. Swanson’s performance taking corners from the left side, which were hit too high and too long to find anyone at the far post, suggested Hayes might want to find a different strategy there. Trinity Rodman (forward): 7 Rodman scored her first goal of the calendar year with a stunning heel pass to herself and spin move in the center of the box to get herself free from a defender and unsettle the keeper. She then fired a shot right into the geographic center of the net. But as has been the case on so many occasions, Rodman too often provided the “almost,” most notably a point-blank header in the box in the first minute of first-half added time that was sent 2 yards wide of the right post. Substitutes Lynn Williams (forward): 4.5 A replacement for the injured Catarina Macario, Williams played with a brace on her leg and looked a bit hobbled as well. Williams provided minimal threat despite the abundance of USWNT possession. Korbin Albert (midfielder): 4 A halftime substitute for Lavelle, Albert had a great opportunity to score in the 56th minute off a beautiful pass from Horan, but she ignored an open teammate at the far post – and the wide open space in that direction – to put a shot directly at the keeper. That seemed to be a habit. In the final minute of added time, she once again ignored an opportunity to set up a teammate and fired a shot right at the keeper. Casey Krueger (left back): 6 Not long after entering the game, in the 67th minute, Krueger had an opportunity to shoot from the left side of the box but took too long to fire and saw the shot blocked. She then gave away the rebound for what could have been a Zambia break. But she later put in a perfect cross in for Dunn, who misfired a header, and contributed defensively with a hustling run to foil a breakaway. Jenna Nighswonger (right back): 5 It was hard to tell what position Nighswonger was playing because no one really was functioning as an outside back. She and Krueger were playing outside (slightly less) forward. She had limited access to the ball and few opportunities. Emily Sonnett (midfielder): 5 If her job was to allow Horan to rest, she got that done for sure.",
