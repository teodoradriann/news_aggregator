    "text": "[The Miami Heat got an](https://clutchpoints.com/heat-news-erik-spoelstra-gets-100-real-on-constant-injury-woes) exceptional victory Thursday night as they took down the Golden State Warriors, 114-102, to get their fourth straight to extend their winning streak. It was especially impressive [since the Heat continue](https://clutchpoints.com/heat-news-jimmy-butler-headlines-long-list-of-players-out-vs-warriors) to suffer from injury problems as they were missing four key players including star Jimmy Butler. Going deep into the rotation, Heat head coach [Erik Spoelstra](/tag/erik-spoelstra) gave some playing time to the likes of the team's G-League stars in Nikola Jovic, Jamal Cain, and even R.J. Hampton who was in the starting lineup. Spoelstra said after the [game to the media](https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/nba/miami-heat/article283614313.html) that without the three players mentioned before, the win is not going in the favor of Miami according to Anthony Chiang of The Miami Herald. “Without those three guys and their contributions tonight, we’re not winning this game,” Spoelstra said. “They all gave us impactful moments throughout the course of the game. The three young guys in particular, it’s not easy, they go often times weeks without playing, but they have to stay ready, as UD [Udonis Haslem] always says, to be ready. And then they also have to improve. So they can’t just be the same players they are because they’re trying to prove themselves and really establish themselves in this league.” As a part of the win to the Warriors, Hampton played 25 minutes, having seven points, three assists, and two rebounds. Jovic had 11 points, three rebounds, and three assists. Finally, Cain led the three with 18 points and six rebounds. Heat young players bouncing back after tough G-League loss [In terms of the Heat's](https://clutchpoints.com/heat-news-tyler-herro-gets-100-real-on-threat-of-goat-shooter-stephen-curry) G-League affiliate team in the Sioux Falls Skyforce, the three players have been in an out as the Heat call them up to provide some depth to the lineup. In fact, Hampton, Jovic, and Cain all started on Dec. 19 for the Skyforce against the Raptors 905 and lost 129-110 in the G-League Winter Classic according to The Miami Herald. Spoelstra talks about the trip to see that game and called it “horrible” and a “disaster.” After the disappointing result to the game, they each got called up and provided significant minutes for the Heat against the Warriors. When Spoelstra was asked about what changed for the young possible stars-in-the-making, he responded with “nothing changed.” “All of that is important. This is the part that nobody really wants to hear,” Spoelstra said. “Player development is not just getting shots after practice with a player development coach. It is learning how to impact winning, learning how to embrace a role, dealing with losing.” Spoelstra talks about the player's accountability Spoelstra recounts the conversation in team meetings about the G-League loss and said they were “ashamed” that they played not up to their standards. However, the successful head coach calls it “player development.” “They walked into our team meting and they felt so ashamed because we played poorly and they wanted to play better,” Spoelstra said per The Miami Herald. “Well, I think that’s part of player development. You get angry, you start to figure out collectively how you can find some solutions to get over the top, to play better and to win. And I think when there’s a score, all of it is good. You celebrate the times that you play well. And then you figure out when you’re not playing well what we need to do to do better.” Spoelstra talks about players stepping up after injuries Despite the recent success of Miami, they still deal with a ton of injuries so it may not be the last time fans of the team see Hampton, Cain, or Jovic. It has been so drastic that Thursday marked the Heat's 17th different starting lineup. “The big thing, we’ve had a lot of moving parts and this has required our team to have a lot of different guys step up. That’s the way we’ve looked at it,” Spoelstra said. “You want guys to feel involved, feel like they can contribute to winning, feel like they can impact winning, learn how they can impact winning. And I’ve said now for a few weeks: As we try to figure things out, a great talent to learn in this league as a team is just to learn how to win and then you figure out all the minutiae.” [Miami looks to](https://clutchpoints.com/warriors-news-steve-kerr-reveals-how-golden-state-heat-are-kindred-spirits-in-finding-draft-gems) end the year of 2023 off with a five-game winning streak as their next game will be against the Utah Jazz on Saturday. As a part of the team's current five-game road trip, they start the New Year facing the duo of basketball teams from Los Angeles in the Clippers and Lakers. The Heat is currently 19-12 on the season which puts them at fourth in the Eastern Conference.",

    "title": "Jew-hatred persists despite ‘never again’",
    "text": "Recently, I visited Auschwitz. I had never before visited any of the death camps. The experience is absolutely chilling.\nAuschwitz, of course, was a complex of camps, the three largest of which were Auschwitz I, the camp most famous for the terrifyingly Orwellian German slogan welded onto its entrance, “ARBEIT MACHT FREI”; Auschwitz II, also known as Birkenau, the massive death factory at which the Germans operated four large gas chambers, each of which could be used to murder 2,000 people at a time; and Auschwitz III, a large labor camp.\nVisiting in January, with the ice covering the ground, is a reminder of the cruelties that are possible when human beings commit to the perverse disease of Jew-hatred.\nAuschwitz was liberated some 79 years ago this month. But that perverse disease is alive and well. As survivor Marian Turski says, “Auschwitz did not fall suddenly from the skies, it was all tiny steps approaching until what happened here behind me did happen.”\nThat gradualism masked the greatest evil in world history. As we descended into Krakow for the visit, I read the diaries of Victor Klemperer, a secular, intermarried Jew who had converted to Protestantism and who lived in Dresden during the period of Hitler’s rule. Klemperer details the slow but steady changes that turned Jews into outcasts, no matter their ideology or even religious practice.\nKlemperer, for his part, considered himself a good German and the Nazis the outliers; even in 1942, Klemperer wrote, “I am fighting the most difficult of battles for my German-ness now. I must hold on to it: I am German, the others are un-German.”\nHis protestations meant nothing.\nWhy?\nBecause Jew-hatred is and was a conspiracy theory rooted in the supposed power of the Jew. And there is nothing new about that theory; it is seductive and easy and ancient. In Egypt, Pharaoh spoke thus: “Look, the children of Israel are too numerous and large for us. Let us deal shrewdly with them, so that they may not increase.”\nIn Persia, Haman told Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people, scattered and dispersed among the other peoples in all the provinces of your realm, whose laws are different from those of any other people and who do not obey the king’s laws.”\nIn Poland, Bogdan Chmielnicki told the Poles that they had been sold by the Polish nobility “into the hands of the accursed Jews.” In Russia, the bestselling “Protocols of the Elders of Zion” alleged a Jewish conspiracy to exploit and control the gentile world.\nIn Germany, Hitler wrote that the Jews sought to make the gentile world “ripe for the slave’s lot of permanent subjugation.”\nToday, across the Muslim world, the toxic proposition that the Jews control the world is a popular notion and provides justification for murderous terrorist attacks on Jewish civilians: according to a recent poll from the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies, only 5% of all Middle Eastern and North African Arabs condemned Oct. 7 as an “illegitimate operation.”\nAcross time and place, such ideas sprang from religion, from ethnic polarization, from nationalistic excess. Today, at least in the West, such ideas spring from an ideology that suggests a hierarchy of oppression that dominates Western societies, in which disproportionately successful groups are victimizers and disproportionately unsuccessful groups the victimized.\nIt is no coincidence that LGBTQ+ and BLM activists, who propagate that victim/victimizer narrative, side with the genocidal Jew-hating terror group Hamas. According to a recent Harvard/Harris poll, some 67% of people aged 18-24 in the United States say that the Jews “as a class are oppressors and should be treated as oppressors.”\nVisiting Auschwitz, one can see the apex results of such perverse ideas. Another Holocaust may not be right around the corner; geopolitical conditions are not what they were in 1940, and no serious power has the means and capacity to accomplish anything like the Holocaust today. But certainly the slogan “Never Again” cannot be used by those who currently hand-wave the atrocities of Oct. 7 in the name of fighting supposed “Jewish power.” The only way to stop Jew-hatred is to stop conspiratorial thinking — particularly the conspiratorial thinking of those in the West who despise meritocracy itself and instead see the mirage of the “powerful Jew” hiding behind every problem.",

Contundente, el actor le contestó: “No, no, no. De eso no hablo directamente . Yo paré porque ya te vi, la cantidad de guardias que estás haciendo y todo. Y aparte, yo nunca hablé de nada. Yo me baso en eso. Yo nunca hablé de nada.

En eso yo me puedo recontra agarrar, porque vos podés buscar material mío que nunca me vas a encontrar hablando de nadie , y mucho menos de nada que no me corresponda.

    "text": "Former Olympian’s home robbed, memorabilia stolen, Roswell police say ROSWELL, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - A thief stole Olympic memorabilia and other items from a former Olympian’s home in Roswell, according to the city’s police department. “There’s so many memories and such a sense of pride attached to being a part of Team USA, that’s mainly what I want back. And I hope they find who did this,” said Chris Kinney, in an interview with Atlanta News First on Thursday. Police said Christopher Kinney, 35, spoke with police after noticing his home cameras had been disconnected. When police arrived at the apartment, they saw the side door of Kinney’s apartment pried open. Police said the apartment was “ransacked and trashed.” Kinney was out of town at the time of the burglary. “All of my jackets are gone, anything with the Olympic logo on it and Team USA is all gone,” Kinney said. A friend of Kinney’s was able to give video footage of the incident and help Kinney determine what had been stolen. Kinney noticed that the thief had taken Olympic jackets, pins and a comforter, along with personal documents and two swords. Video footage showed a Hispanic male wearing a white mask, blue jeans and blue jacket disabling the cameras, according to police. Kinney, who grew up in Stockbridge, competed in the four-man bobsled event in the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Kinney said also taken were family heirlooms including a doll given to him by his grandmother along with his car keys. “My TV, my camera and stuff, those are things can be replaced. It sucks to have to replace them. But I can’t put a value on my Team USA stuff and the stuff I got from my grandmother,” Kinney said. If you have any information on the whereabouts of the stolen items, you’re encouraged to reach out to the Roswell Police Department. Copyright 2024 WANF. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) Two days after a Vatican-mandated investigation found no evidence that Gérald Lacroix committed sexual abuse, the Quebec cardinal released a video statement saying he did nothing wrong. \"I maintain my innocence,\" Lacroix said in a video published on YouTube on Thursday. On Tuesday, retired Quebec Superior Court judge André Denis released the results of his investigation , which found that he couldn't find anything that would substantiate the allegations. Denis acknowledged, however, that his probe was incomplete because the complainant refused to take part in the investigation, and that her lack of participation \"has left me at a loss.\" Pope Francis, who appointed the Quebec cardinal as Archbishop of Quebec in March 2023 , had asked the ex-judge in February to look into the allegations, which first arose from a class-action lawsuit. Lacroix's name was among 15 added to a list of alleged perpetrators in the court document, authorized in Superior Court in 2022, that made several claims of sexual abuse by clergy and staff dating back to 1940. In his video on Thursday, he said he wants the \"light to be shed fully and completely\" on the allegations he's accused of. \"I invite the plaintiff to contact Judge Denis as he has proposed or to file a criminal complaint against me so that a proper trial can be held. The community has the right to know whether or not the acts of which I am accused took place,\" the cardinal said. He also welcomed the investigative report — an indication that the church takes sexual abuse allegations seriously, he said. The report concluded that there was no need for Lacroix to face a judicial process at the Vatican. Arsenault Dufresne Wee, the Montreal-based law firm that represents the complainant, took issue with Denis' investigation, saying it had no real impact and that its client didn't want to take part in an internal process that lacked credibility. \"She wants to take part in a trial at the Quebec Superior Court because it’s an independent tribunal,\" lawyer Alain Arsenault said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Tuesday. In his video statement, Lacroix thanked his supporters for their prayers and said that he has decided not to return to his duties as Archbishop since stepping aside in January. \"I have voluntarily chosen to remain discreet,\" he said. \"I will re-evaluate my decision periodically.\" With files from The Canadian Press Montreal Top Stories CTVNews.ca Top Stories Hackers release corporate data stolen from London Drugs Retailer London Drugs says cybercriminals who stole files from its corporate head office last month have released some of the data after it refused to pay a ransom.
