    "text": "Sylhet, June 20 -- State Minister for Water Resources Ministry Zahid Faruk on Thursday said the government will take steps to dredge the Surma River to protect Sylhet city from early floods. The construction work of nine dredging stations across the country is underway and steps will be taken for dredging of the Surma River soon, he said while talking to reporters after visiting the Shaadi Canal in Tukerbazar area of Sylhet city on Thursday. Water from upstream brings silt that obstructs the normal flow of the river, said the minister adding, &quot;We have talked to the engineers that the dredging of the Surma River will begin soon.&quot; All necessary steps will be taken to deal with the flood situation, he said. Sylhet City Corporation Mayor Md Anwaruzzaman Chowdhury, official concerned of Sylhet Water Development Board and local administration were present there.

    "title": "European Parliament calls for permanent ceasefire in Gaza, demands conditions for peace",
    "text": "Endzeiter/ Pixabay [European Parliament calls for permanent ceasefire in Gaza, demands conditions for peace](#)\nEuropean lawmakers\nadopted a resolution Thursday urging a permanent ceasefire in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. The resolution, although non-binding and symbolic, reflects the European Parliament’s stance on the matter. This marks the first time the European Parliament has explicitly called for a permanent ceasefire in the conflict.\nThe\noriginal text emphasized the need for a permanent ceasefire, but conservative lawmakers introduced an amendment, demanding the dismantling of Hamas for the ceasefire to take effect. Additionally, the amendment called for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages held by Hamas.\nThe resolution garnered support from 312 votes in favor, 131 against and 72 abstentions, highlighting the divisive nature of the issue within the EU. The resolution condemns both Hamas’ “despicable\n[terrorist attacks](/news/2023/11/israel-families-of-hamas-victims-file-icc-complaint-as-accusations-of-war-crimes-genocide-exchanged/)” against Israel and Israel’s “disproportionate” [military response](/news/2023/11/palestine-rights-groups-file-icc-lawsuit-against-israel-alleging-war-crimes-genocide/), which has resulted in a high civilian death toll with over 23,000 Palestinians killed. European lawmakers asserted Israel’s right to self-defense within the limits of international law, emphasizing the need to distinguish between combatants and civilians.\nThe resolution strongly condemned\n[extremist settler violence](/news/2023/11/un-human-rights-office-expresses-alarm-at-israel-settler-and-military-violence-in-west-bank/) and advocated for EU restrictive measures against those violating human rights and international law. Following Hamas’ [October 7 attacks](/news/2023/10/at-least-100-israeli-civilians-killed-following-hamas-ground-and-rocket-attacks/) against Israel, the UN Human Rights Office issued a statement concerning “human rights violations” in the West Bank, which have displaced almost 1,000 Palestinians from their homes. In the period spanning from October 7, 2023, to January 4, 2024, there was a record-high Palestinian death toll in the West Bank, where over 300 Palestinians died from violence by Israeli troops or settlers.\nThe resolution expressed strong support for the work of the International Criminal Court and\n[International Court of Justice](/news/2024/01/south-africa-lays-out-genocide-case-against-israel-at-icj/), calling for accountability for those responsible for terrorist acts and violations of international law.\nIn a broader diplomatic context, the resolution called for a European initiative to reinstate the two-state solution and supported efforts for Middle East pace. It endorsed the\nArab Peace Initiative of 2002, urging the full normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states in exchange for Israel’s withdrawal from occupied territories since 1967.",

    "text": "Electricity bosses are “very confident” that the remaining 750 properties in Scotland without power after [Storm Gerrit](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/thousands-scots-homes-still-without-31765400) will be reconnected on Friday. Graeme Keddie, the director of corporate affairs at SSEN, said “hard work” by its staff has reconnected more than 45,000 properties who had lost power as a result of the latest storm to hit the UK. High winds, heavy rain and [snow](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scotland-could-see-20cm-snow-31759780?int_source=nba) damaged electricity networks in some parts of the country, but Mr Keddie said that by Friday morning there were 750 homes remaining without electricity, describing that as a “much improved picture”. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme, he told how SSEN staff had “made a tremendous effort in restoring power to customers affected by Storm Gerrit, battling some very tough weather conditions”. He said: “We have now restored power to over 45,000 homes and there are now 750 homes still to be connected. “And we’re confident through the resource levels we have we can reconnect these customers throughout today.” He thanked those affected for their “ongoing patience” as the power firm makes its “final push” to restore electricity. Storm Gerrit resulted in a “lot of localised faults” to the power network, Mr Geddie said, adding there were a “lot of points of multiple damage”. This he said was “down to the ferocity of Storm Gerrit”, adding that wind speeds had been up to 10mph higher than had been forecast in some areas. Join the Daily Record WhatsApp community!

Winds at Inverbervie, on the Aberdeenshire cost, reached 86mph during Storm Gerrit, he said – adding this was higher than the 78mph winds that hit the town during Storm Arwen in November 2021.

    "text": "El sacerdote Filiberto Velázquez, director del Centro de Derechos Humanos “Minerva Bello” en Guerrero, aseguró que la iglesia puede representar un factor importante en el Gobierno Federal para el cese de violencia en zonas con alta presencia del [crimen organizado](https://www.radioformula.com.mx/nacional/2024/2/22/tlacos-familia-michoacana-lideres-pactan-tregua-tras-masacre-en-guerrero-803338.html). En entrevista con Joaquín Lópéz-Dóriga, el religioso aseguró que el acuerdo entre La Familia Michoacana y Los Tlacos se dio por iniciativa propia de las organizaciones criminales, sin embargo, en más de una ocasión comunicaron a este medio que más de un sacerdote intervino como mediador. “El Estado tiene que dejarse ayudar y no vernos como enemigos o ‘abogados del diablo’. Piensan que los estamos atacando y yo no quisiera que un gobierno fallara, al contrario quisiera que tenga éxito este gobierno morenista, pero se tiene que dejar ayudar por la sociedad civil y por las iglesias”, declaró. Narco firman pax narca El jueves pasado, Filiberto Velázquez dio a conocer que La Familia Michoacana y Los Tlacos acordaron cesar el fuego entre ellos, pero no precisó si la tregua implica respetar los territorios, ya que en la reunión sólo participaron ambos grupos delictivos. Te podría interesar Según sus declaraciones, el acercamiento entre los grupos delictivos se realizó a través de llamadas, donde únicamente participan los capos que lideran ambos cárteles. En Guerrero, estos grupos criminales, así como el Cártel de Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG), el Cártel de Sinaloa y el Cártel Independiente de Acapulco, no sólo controlan zonas dedicadas a la siembra y trasiego de drogas, sino también a ilícitos como la extorsión, secuestro, desaparición forzada y otros de alto impacto, tales como robo a transportistas y a ferrocarriles, de acuerdo con la consultora Integralia. La violencia entre la Familia Michoacana y Los Tlacos quedó expuesta el pasado fin de semana, cuando se dio a conocer un enfrentamiento que protagonizaron en San Miguel Totolapan el cual dejó un saldo de 12 personas muertas, según datos del Gobierno Federal.",
