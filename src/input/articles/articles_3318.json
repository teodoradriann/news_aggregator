    "text": "St. Thomas Becket was born in London, England, around the year 1117. His parents were pious, and from his childhood, Thomas received instruction in the faith. He was taught at a monastery, and then went to school in London.\nAfter his parents died, Thomas decided to study canon law, and became a secretary to one of the courts of London. He felt called to the priesthood, and began to work towards ordination. His holy, honest working attitude came to the attention of his friend King Henry II, and in 1157, Thomas was asked to serve as Lord Chancellor to the king.\nAfter the bishop of Canterbury died, Henry sought to elect Thomas to the position. In 1162, a synod accepted this election. Although Thomas warned the king that it might cause friction, he took on the position.\nAs bishop, Thomas practiced many penances, and worked hard to serve the people while developing his own personal holiness. He was generous to the poor in his time and his money.\nHowever, Henry began to exercise his hand in Church affairs, causing many disagreements between the two. At one point, Thomas retired for a while to France. When he returned to England, he and Henry entered into another dispute. Henry’s knights saw Thomas’ actions as treason, and killed him in his own church on December 29, 1170.",

    "text": "The Telegraph Maj Gen Tony Boam, skilled diplomatist who talked a Nigerian president out of bloodshed – obituary Read full article Telegraph Obituaries December 31, 2023 at 8:00 a.m. · 5 min read Major General Tony Boam in August 1987, leaving Hong Kong with his wife Penny Major General Tony Boam, who has died aged 91, had a distinguished career as a soldier and was a man with an exceptional gift for friendship and impressive skills as a diplomatist.\nSeveral years after his retirement from the Army, the Foreign Office asked Boam to fly to Nigeria on a special mission and in a personal capacity. The President, General Sani Abacha, had imprisoned the previous head of state, General Olusegun Obasanjo, alleging that he was plotting a coup, and was threatening to execute him.\nMany of the world’s Muslim leaders had appealed for clemency and the Foreign Office was hoping that Boam, with his in-depth knowledge of the country and its leaders, would succeed where other attempts had failed.\nBoam had been well briefed by the British High Commissioner on the situation in Nigeria but when the two men arrived at the President’s grand residence in Abuja, General Abacha said that he wanted to see Boam on his own.\nAbacha had been a student on the first course held by the new Nigerian Staff College which Boam himself had set up at Kaduna in 1976. Boam said later that he talked to Abacha as if he were still one of his students. He told him that he ought to get out more and find out what was really happening in the country, and he stressed that there had been too much fighting and bloodshed. The meeting, lasting for two hours, was cordial and Obasanjo’s life was spared.\nThomas Anthony Boam was born in Chester on February 14 1932. His grandfather served with the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War and was chairman of the family colliery business. His father was an officer in the Royal Leicestershire Regiment and his mother was born in New Zealand.\nYoung Tony was educated at Bradfield College before joining the Guards Depot, Caterham, Surrey, in 1950. After Sandhurst he was commissioned into the Scots Guards and posted to the 1st Battalion (1SG) at Port Said, Canal Zone. His platoon sergeant was a veteran of the Long Range Desert Group and he acquired a lifelong love of the desert.\nStory continues As a young officer in Egypt, c1954 On his return to London, he took part in ceremonial duties, an experience which gave his colleagues much amusement and confirmed his dislike of horses. After a staff job at the War Office followed by attendance at Staff College, he commanded a company of 2SG in Kenya.\nBoam was then posted to HQ 4 Guards Brigade at Iserlohn, British Army of the Rhine, before returning to regimental duty as second-in-command of 1SG in Malaysia in 1966. Two years as brigade major of 4 Guards Brigade led to a posting to Staff College as an instructor.\nIn January 1972, at short notice, he reformed and trained 2SG for operations in Northern Ireland before taking it to Londonderry as a reinforcement for Operation Motorman. The aim of the operation, one of the largest carried out by the British Army since the Suez crisis, was to clear the barricades from what had become “No-Go” areas.\nTony Boam It was a year which proved to be one of the deadliest in the Province. Boam visited every company HQ, observation post and outpost, usually on foot, every day and night. He rarely got more than four hours of sleep a day. Four of his men were killed and one wounded but gradually the patrols got the upper hand.\nAfter the end of the four-month emergency tour, the battalion went back to England only to return to Northern Ireland in November for a further four months, this time in West Belfast. Boam was awarded an Operational OBE.\nIn May 1974, he handed over command of 2SG and, in January 1976, arrived in Nigeria with instructions to set up and run a Staff College at Kaduna for the Nigerian Army. He had a team including 12 lieutenant-colonels, whose initial task was to train students who had all fought in the Biafran War but had received no formal instruction. By the time he left in 1976, the College was running well and he was advanced to CBE.\nHis next appointment was that of Deputy Commander British Forces Hong Kong as a brigadier, followed by a further promotion to major general as head of the British Defence Staff in Washington. In 1982, after the invasion of the Falklands by Argentine forces, he played a notable part in developing close relations with key commanders in the Pentagon, briefing the British Ambassador and co-ordinating requests for assistance.\nHis final posting, from 1985 to 1987, was as Commander British Forces Hong Kong, and Major General Brigade of Gurkhas. He was appointed CB at the end of his tour.\nMajor General Tony Boam leaving British Forces HQ in Hong Kong in a rickshaw at the end of his tour, 1987 After suffering a severe heart attack, his career in the Army came to an abrupt end but he made the transition to civilian life with typical energy and enthusiasm. An accomplished sportsman, he was a good tennis player and a keen watcher of cricket. In 2017, he was delighted to be given a life membership of the MCC and he regularly treated family members to a day’s cricket at Lords.\nFor seven years he was director of the British Consultancy Bureau (later renamed the British Expertise International) and travelled widely to promote British businesses. Among his work for charity, he was vice-president of the Leonard Cheshire Foundation and chairman of 4 Sight, the West Sussex Association for the Blind from 2003 to 2006. He took an active part in his village community as a churchwarden and in social events. He was a keen bridge player.\nTony Boam married, in 1961, Penelope (Penny) Roberts. He nursed her, devotedly, through her long struggle with Alzheimer’s, from which she died in 2016. He is survived by their son and two daughters.\nTony Boam, born February 14 1932, died November 20 2023\nTRENDING 1.

Durante esta fase, la representación de los pilotos de Aeroméxico está en negociaciones con la aerolínea, con el objetivo de alcanzar acuerdos que beneficien a ambas partes. El emplazamiento a huelga está previsto para el primer minuto del 1 de octubre, como marca el contrato colectivo de los trabajadores de la aerolínea. \"Reiteramos nuestra disposición al diálogo para llegar a acuerdos justos\", añadió ASPA, al manifestar su interés por concretar la revisión del contrato en tiempo y forma.

    "title": "Joe Jonas Shares Photos of Aspen Getaway With Model Stormi Bree | Us Weekly",
    "text": "[Joe Jonas](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/joe-jonas/) seemed to fully enjoy his time in Aspen, Colorado, with model [Stormi Bree](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/who-is-stormi-bree-meet-the-model-spotted-with-joe-jonas-in-mexico/). The Jonas Brothers singer, 34, shared a few clips of his snowy getaway via his Instagram Story on Friday, January 5. He showed off the breathtaking view while riding on a ski lift and some twinkling lights during an outdoor stroll. In another upload, he used a peace sign emoji to caption the view outside of his airplane window as he flew over the mountains, indicating that it’s now back to reality for the musician. While he kept his new lovebug (real name Stormi Henley) out of frame, it appears she was by his side during the whole trip. The model shared her own photos and videos skiing on a mountain with a companion on Friday. Bree’s short video of twinkle lights and snow falling on a quiet street even appeared to match up to the clip Joe shared. Jonas and Bree, 33, were first spotted together at a private airport in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, on Wednesday, January 3, before jetting off to Aspen. An insider exclusively told Us Weekly that “ [things are still very new](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/joe-jonas-is-enjoying-spending-time-with-model-stormi-bree/)” between the duo, but Jonas is “happy” and “open to seeing where things go.” “Joe is enjoying spending time with Stormi,” the insider continued. “His main priority and focus will always be his children, but at the same time, he’s putting himself out there and is open to what’s to come.” Before his getaway with Bree, Jonas filed for divorce from Sophie Turner in September 2023 after four years of marriage. They share two daughters, Willa and Delphine. At the time, the exes said they “mutually” and “amicably” decided to end their marriage in a joint statement, writing, “There are many speculative narratives as to why but, truly this is a united decision and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children.” Turner, 27, later [sued Jonas](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sophie-turner-sues-joe-jonas-wants-daughters-to-live-in-u-k/), claiming he was wrongfully detaining their children in the U.S. He denied the accusations, and the twosome reached a temporary custody agreement in October 2023. The Game of Thrones actress, for her part, has also moved on. A separate insider told Us that Turner has “been [casually dating a few people](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sophie-turner-happy-with-peregrine-pearson-amid-joe-jonas-divorce/)” since her split from Jonas. She was spotted getting cozy with British aristocrat Peregrine “Perry” Pearson during a few outings in December 2023.",

El medio británicotambién dijo que encontró pruebas de que estaba recaudando fondos en línea para miembros del EI, lo cual es ilegal.\nun periodista la contactó después de que escapase de la prisión Camp Hol de Siria para mujeres que estaban con el grupo terrorista y sus hijos.\nDurante dichos intercambios, Shamima despidió a su ex amiga por “vivir de los beneficios” y se burló de ella como una fracasada y una no creyente.\nUn ex miembro de la organización terrorista le dijo a la BBC que la joven era fanática incluso para los estándares del Estado Islámico.\nhttps://www.larazon.es/internacional/shamima-begum-novia-yihad-britanica-que-indigno-pais-creyente-segun-amigo-que-inspiro-unirse-estado-islamico_20230322641b5d82079ac90001803bb2.html\n[#6](c6#c-6) Sí, ahora con ~25 tacos ya tiene que ser consciente de su mierda y que ella se la ha buscado (No me parece mal que le retiren la ciudadanía). Pero las raices de eso son de hace 10 años. Por eso no lo veo tan blanco o negro. Quizás ahora simplemente es tarde para una mejor solución.\nY que mira, que si la tía es tan fanática, con su pan se lo coma.\n[#6](c6#c-6) A ver, lo que pone en esa noticia es verdad aunque esté fatal explicado.\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/uk-65031943\nEsta es la fuente original y en ella no consigo entender cuándo fue lo de \"pedía dinero a través de internet y ese dinero acababa en manos de EI\".\nLo de \"se casó y tuvo hijos\" es lo que se dijo en el 2019, por lo que se casó y tuvo tres hijos teniendo entre 15 y 19 años. Que no ha pasado de 15 años a mayor de edad sin nada de por medio.\nPero vamos, que todo apunta a que apenas se arrepiente y que está demasiado vinculada al radicalismo como para dejarla volver sin vigilancia continua.\n[#6](c6#c-6) \"vivir de los beneficios\" es una traduccion horrible de \"live off benefits\" (o como sea el originbal). Basicamente, es vivir de las ayudas sociales que en Inglaterra se llaman benefits. T\n[#26](c26#c-26) No, vivir de la beneficiencia es vivir de instituciones y demas. Yo, por tener hijos, tengo derecho al child benefit. Eso no significa que mis hijos estan en la benficiciencia, sino que el gobierno me da unas cuantas libras al mes como ayuda para mantener a mis hijos.\n[#33](c33#c-33) Como va a ser la traduccion correcta si cambia el significado? Las ayudas economicas a los parados en España, en Inglaterra se llaman benefits. Cualquier ayuda economica del gobierno, se llama benefits como palabra generica.\nAqui estan los benefits a los que me refiero:\nhttps://www.gov.uk/browse/benefits/low-income\nNo creo que eso sea beneficencia.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Cierto, luego piensas que esta gente ponian videos de decapitaciones y quemar vivos a prisioneros y ....\nhay cosas que son dificiles de perdonar.\nBastante lógico. Los fanáticos, mejor cuanto más lejos, sin importar la edad a la que se fanatizó.\nSi les podemos denunciar por captar a personas y esto es delito deberiamos aceptar que hay personas en situacion de vulnerabilidad o incluso de falta de capacidad d raciocinio al completo (Menor de edad) como para que puedas asumir que no son totalmente libres de tomar esas decisiones (Puedes ser mayor de edad y tomar decisiones de manera coaccionada)\nQue sera lo siguiente? Te han estafado pero.. como eres mayor de edad, deberias haberte dado cuenta. Ah si, te ha violado... pero, deberias haber sido lista para no ir con esa persona que tenia malas pintas....\n[#10](c10#c-10) Saludos. Creo que la diferencia con esos ejemplos que das es que la víctima no se volvió victimario. Si el estafado se metió en un esquema ponzi y terminó estafando a otras personas posiblemente algo le caería también; igualmente si el violado termina considerando que ese comportamiento es correcto y él mismo viola a otros, impune dudo que salga. Podrán considerarse atenuantes, pero la responsabilidad existe, en el caso de ella igualmente habrá atenuantes, y tal vez por eso no sufriría una pena mayor como pasar el resto de su vida en una cárcel (al menos por ahora, otra cosa es que siga acumulando delitos), sino sólo la pérdida de la nacionalidad que es una medida que busca proteger a la sociedad.\nSe unio a un protoestado cuyo objetivo era destruir -entre otros- al Reino Unido, pues que se joda. Que la manden a Siria donde seguro cumplira pena en condiciones. Bonus extra por quitarse el velo para no parecer lo que seguro que sigue siendo. Me recuerda al psicopata aquel Rodrigo Lanza que en el juicio por asesinato iba bien vestido, peinado y aseado para disimular que es un antifa\nAleluya!!! Por fin llega el sentido común y la cordura.\nTe vas a esclavizar yazidíes, a apedrear mujeres, a colaborar con terroristas. Pues ya quedate allí.",

But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Hosek says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Hosek standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Hosek would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Hosek told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Hosek found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Hosek said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Hosek wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](https://www.kitsapsun.com/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Hosek gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Hosek waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Hosek is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Hosek said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Hosek added.",

    "title": "¿Por amaño? América podría ser sancionado por FIFA sin hacer fichajes hasta 2026",
    "text": "El cuadro azulcrema podría tener serios problemas debido a un adeudo por uno de sus futbolistas. En el América no todo es miel sobre hojuelas, ya que en medio de la celebración del bicampeonato llegó la denuncia de un equipo por adeudar dinero por uno de sus jugadores, por lo que las Águilas podrían recibir un duro castigo por parte de la FIFA sin hacer fichajes. Si bien el cuadro capitalino es reconocido por ser uno de los más estables a nivel financiero en México, no está exento de dichos problemas, más cuando ya se hayan presentado pruebas de que no hicieron el pago de una de sus contrataciones en el pasado. PODRÍA INTERESARTE: Revelan la fecha que el Estadio Azteca volverá a abrir sus puertas previo al Mundial Según información del diario Récord, Cerro Porteño acudió a la FIFA para acusar la falta de un pago por parte del América en la negociación de Cecilio Domínguez, dicha cifra tendría que ver con la venta que las Águilas hicieron del paraguayo y por la cual debieron mandar un extra al club sudamericano. El paraguayo no pudo consolidarse con las Águilas. (Archivo SoyReferee) Señalan que la deuda del cuadro mexicano ascendería al medio millón de dólares y que el propio organismo que rige el futbol internacional ya habría ordenado a la directiva azulcrema el saldar la deuda, sino podría llegar una sanción de hasta tres ventanas sin hacer fichajes. América podría librar la sanción de no hacer fichajes Por ahora no hay ninguna respuesta por parte del equipo azulcrema, no obstante se espera que puedan terminar con los problemas al depositar la cifra indicada y, según los lineamientos de la FIFA, así se librarían de la fuerte sanción que ya les advirtieron. PODRÍA INTERESARTE: Chivas le roba otro futbolista al América de manera sorpresiva Curiosamente el movimiento en el que América se estaría metiendo el problema con la FIFA es uno que ellos mismos cuestionaron, ya que Independiente ha tardado en hacer el pago correspondiente por Cecilio Domínguez.
