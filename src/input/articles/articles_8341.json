    "text": "'A cancer survivor asking for change': Meet USA TODAY’s Women of the Year honoree from Ohio Michele Young is one of the nominees for USA TODAY’s Women of the Year program, a recognition of women who have made a significant impact in their communities and across the country. The program launched in [2022](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/opinion/2022/03/13/melinda-french-gates-simone-biles-women-of-year/6922631001/) as a continuation of [Women of the Century](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/life/women-of-the-century/2020/08/13/history-constitution-19th-amendment-woman-voting-rights-100-years/4939990002/), which commemorated the 100th anniversary of women gaining the right to vote. Meet this year’s honorees at [womenoftheyear.usatoday.com](https://www.usatoday.com/women-of-the-year-2024). Cincinnati attorney [Michele Young](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2022/10/28/michele-young-breast-cancer-survivor-thats-so-cincinnati-podcast/69596930007/) knows what it's like to treat each day like it's her last. Years ago, she was told her days were numbered following a breast cancer diagnosis caught six years too late. Since then, she's worked every moment she's still breathing to make sure no other woman is ever put in that same position. In 2018, Young was [diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/11/08/2020-enquirer-woman-year-michele-young/6038397002/). The mother of five was told her cancer had likely been around since 2012 but went undetected on routine mammograms due to her dense breast tissue (a kind of breast tissue [40% of women have](https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/breast-changes/dense-breasts#:~:text=It%20is%20found%20in%20about%2040%25%20of%20women.,in%20about%2040%25%20of%20women)). At the time, in Ohio, many screenings beyond mammograms weren't covered by insurance, making it difficult for women like Young to catch breast cancer in its early stages. She was given 1 in 100 odds of survival. But Young, a Brooklyn native, is no stranger to defying the odds. Her career as an attorney has been characterized by achieving [multimillion dollar successes](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/05/us/gabriel-taye-cincinnati-bullying.html) for seemingly impossible cases. She was part of the legal team that [secured a $3 million settlement](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2021/06/04/cincinnati-schools-pay-3-million-gabriel-taye-bullying-case/7533101002/) for the family of [Gabriel Taye](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2019/12/05/cincinnati-public-school-argues-its-not-responsible-for-gabriel-taye-suicide/2619146001/), an 8-year-old Cincinnati Public Schools student who killed himself after he was bullied at school. Young was also part of the pro bono effort to free [Tyra Patterson](https://abcnews.go.com/US/woman-giving-back-serving-23-years-prison-murder/story?id=54989828) after she spent 23 years in prison for a crime she did not commit. And right after her diagnosis, Young simply laid out her winning strategy to her doctors at the UC Health Breast Cancer Center. \"We'll save my life, and we'll change the law (surrounding breast cancer screenings),\" Young said on The Enquirer’s [“That’s So Cincinnati”](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2022/10/28/michele-young-breast-cancer-survivor-thats-so-cincinnati-podcast/69596930007/) podcast in October 2022. She did just that. She beat her cancer and entered remission in 2020. In 2022, she helped change the law in Ohio as a major force behind the [passage of House Bill 371](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2022/07/01/breast-cancer-bill-passes-ohio-rest-country-follow/7693741001/), which requires insurance companies to expand [access to advanced breast cancer screenings](https://med.uc.edu/institutes/cancer/coe/ohio-house-bill-371) for women with dense breasts and other risk factors. Now, she's working to introduce similar legislation on the federal level. She's teamed up with, in her words, \"the Oppenheimers of breast cancer\" to get politicians' attention, including breast cancer survivors [Katie Couric](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/08/17/katie-couric-stand-up-to-cancer-breast-cancer/70593521007/) and NBC's [Kristen Dahlgren](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/entertainment/kristen-dahlgren-breast-cancer-trnd/index.html), and Dr. Nora Disis – one of the leading minds [behind a breast cancer vaccine](https://www.bcrf.org/blog/the-progress-and-future-of-breast-cancer-vaccines-with-dr-nora-disis/). Together, they've launched the Pink Eraser Project ( [pinkeraserproject.org](https://pinkeraserproject.org/)), with their sights set on putting an end to breast cancer, once and for all. \"I'm the last woman that's going to be left for dead,\" she said. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Who paved the way for you? My family paved the way for me. My parents are the children of Jewish immigrants who survived the Holocaust. And I watched my parents' idealism. My father taught in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood and my mother taught immigrants in the Forest Hills neighborhood in Queens. And I watched as they tried to make a life for us, make a life for them against many obstacles that they couldn't overcome. They inspired me to lift obstacles for myself and others so we could all have the promise of the American Dream, which captivated my family. What is your proudest moment? In some ways, being in this interview may be one of my proudest moments. Because, five years ago, I was left for dead, told to pull out the plug. And instead, I asked myself, \"Why not spend whatever you've got left on this Earth looking out for others and doing everything you can to make a difference?\" I stayed the course, and I'm here today thinking, \"Well, maybe something really good came out of what happened to me.\" Maybe this year will be this incredible year when we can say, \"We launched the miracle, the miracle of 2024 when we all came together and declared moonshot against breast cancer.\" What is your definition of courage? I think there are many forms of courage. One kind of courage is to bear hardship and evil, bigotry and cruelty and have the courage to say, \"I can stand up to that and still be noble and kind and be the person I want to be.\" The second form involves having the personal courage to ask tough questions of yourself. And ask, \"Am I part of the problem and how do I fix myself so I become part of the solution?\" The third kind of courage, which I think I have an abundance of, is the courage to take on the world and say, \"This is wrong. Do to me what you like. I'm in, I'm staying the course, and I'm not leaving until justice is done.\" Is there a guiding principle or mantra you tell yourself? There are 86,400 seconds in a day. Each one is a chance to transform the world. Who do you look up to? I have so many heroes. I always looked up to my dad whose mom lost everyone from her family in the Holocaust. And his whole life, whether he's fighting two wars in the U.S. or teaching in the inner-city (of New York) day and night, he took care of our family. I look up to my sweet husband, Greg Young, who, as a Cincinnatian, UDF ice cream-eating guy who has never missed a Bengals game, has unconditional love for who I am as I am. And, I look up to my five unbelievably amazing kids with a mom who can sometimes be embarrassing and who is different and who has had adversity. And they've loved me to the moon and back, and I have loved them. I look up to my twin sister, who lovingly saw me through my entire breast cancer journey before she died of COVID-19 in 2022. Finally, I have to add: I look up to every single superhero comic whose pledges I have taken to memory. Because, as a child, I dreamed of rescuing others. How do you overcome adversity? Overcoming adversity seems to be my great gift. I do so with a vision of what the world could be when you overcome it and how many people you can take along with you as you go forward. I am glad that adversity has struck me over and over again because it's allowed me, so far, to come back with zealous. What advice would you give your younger self? It's not over 'til it's over. The darkest time of your life may be the beginning of a whole new chance to do good. And, kindness and love is everything. Without it, nothing is right.",

    "text": "by R. Cort Kirkwood, [The New American](https://thenewamerican.com/us/politics/biden-teams-with-soros-to-fund-queer-muslim-project/): The Biden administration has teamed with the subversive Open Society Foundations (OSF) to spread sexual perversion in South Asia. Not satisfied with spreading “trans” propaganda in Pakistan and South America, the State Department pumped more than $10,000 into something called the Queer Muslim Project (QMP), through the Soros cutout OSF. The money continues the administration’s relentless campaign to turn the nation into an international joke, while insulting and alienating as many people across the globe as possible. TRUTH LIVES on at [https://sgtreport.tv/](https://sgtreport.tv/) Biden State Department Shells Out Taxpayer Dollars To ‘Queer’ Muslim Writers In India [https://t.co/RBxLKVRWO1] — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) [December 26, 2023] The Grant The latest waste of tax money on sex perverts will subsidize this: The Queer Muslim Project will provide a platform to a group of young LGBTQIA writers from underrepresented communities in South Asia to showcase their work at a leading Mumbai literature festival alongside writers from the Iowa Writing Program. [Total thrown down](https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_SIN65023GR0128_1900) the homosexual toilet: $15,000. The [Queer Muslim Project](https://www.thequeermuslim.com/), for those who don’t know, is “Asia’s leading online platform for queer, Muslim and allied voices, with a growing global community of over 40,000 people”: We use art, culture, media, and storytelling to challenge harmful stereotypes and norms, build power and visibility of underserved LGBTQIA+ artists and storytellers, and enable them to shape their own narratives. But the QMP won’t receive the money directly. Instead, State funneled it through Creating Resources for Empowerment & Action, Inc. (CREA), an outfit founded by two Indian feminists. “CREA is a feminist international human rights organization based in the Global South and led by women from the Global South. CREA’s work draws upon the inherent value of a rights-based approach to sexuality and gender equality,” its [website explains](https://creaworld.org/who-we-are/): CREA promotes, protects, and advances human rights and the sexual rights of all people by building leadership capacities of activists and allies; strengthening organizations and social movements; creating and increasing access to new information, knowledge, and resources; and enabling supportive social and policy environments. Based in New Delhi, CREA “envisions a more just and peaceful world, where everyone realizes their autonomy, dignity, and equality.” That’s leftist code for “we want legal abortion everywhere” and “sex perverts to have access to children,” as the [website admits](https://creaworld.org/who-we-are/) in more coded language: CREA builds feminist leadership, strengthens movements, challenges unjust power structures, expands sexual and reproductive freedoms, and advances the human rights of structurally excluded people. Foundresses [Geetanjali Misra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geetanjali_Misra) and [Pramada Menon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pramada-menon-0395a62) are “development professionals who had been working in the diverse fields of reproductive health, sexuality, violence against women, media, and women’s rights in India for more than fifteen years.” Alas, the two trailblazers spotted a “troubling lack of prominent feminist voices in India,” and so CREA was born. It’s a “a radical organization focused on developing the leadership capacities of young women in addressing issues of sexuality and reproductive health and rights, violence against women, and social justice.” Open Society Foundations, a key donor, [sent CREA $900,000](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/grants/past?filter_keyword=Creating+Resources+for+Empowerment+and+Action) in 2020 and 2021. OSF, in turn, is the creation of Hungarian communist and globalist subversive George Soros. It was [recently revealed](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/chairs-group-led-effort-boot-trump-colorado-ballot-donated-biden) as a donor to the effort to toss Donald Trump off the 2024 presidential ballot in Colorado.

    "text": "Gov. Kathy Hochul on Friday floated a proposal to build more pools and invest in more training for lifeguards, who have been in short supply in New York’s sweltering recent summers. The drowning deaths of children in city pools have been a deepening problem in New York City, and potent heat spells have heightened many New Yorkers’ desire to cool off at public pools. Hochul’s office said her blueprint is New York’s largest investment in municipal swimming pools since President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal nine decades ago (Roosevelt, a one-time New York governor, also built a pool at the Executive Mansion in Albany.). Folded into Hochul’s plan, she said, is a $60 million investment in a city-state collaboration to build floating pools in New York waterways. The city plans to build a floating, water-filtering pool in the East River, in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge. The pool is to open to the public next year, according to Mayor Adams’ office. It was unclear where exactly the pool would be located, but renderings show it in multiple East River locations, including two different possible spots by Brooklyn Bridge Park. Hochul, a Buffalo Democrat, described swimming as one of her “greatest pleasures.” “I love it,” Hochul said in a news conference at a Harlem community center. “I want every person to love it. I want every child to have access to this. And I want to keep kids alive.” Overall, Hochul’s proposal includes $150 million in grant money for 10 new public swimming pools in high-need areas across the state. The governor’s proposal is an extension of her long-running efforts to bolster the state’s lifeguard ranks, and it came in a series of policy priorities for 2024 she has outlined ahead of a major address scheduled for next week. Over the last two years, Hochul has lowered the minimum age for some lifeguards to 15, and has raised wages for lifeguards at state facilities, hoping to attract more lifeguards to watch over the state’s children at pool time. Drowning is the most common cause of death for children ages 1 to 4, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. In 2020, some 230 New Yorkers died by drowning, Hochul said. “It’s every parent’s nightmare,” the governor said. “But here’s the challenge: the pain is not shared equally among the population. Low-income communities, communities of color have suffered decades of disinvestment in swimming facilities.”",

It said this would help to create the best conditions for launch by continuing to engage closely with the “increasingly positive” Assassin’s Creed community.\nUbisoft has been plagued by delays and the underperformance of some key titles, including a muted reception to the launch of Star Wars Outlaws in August last year, which did not meet sales expectations. The company’s shares lost half of their value in the year to December.\nThe French group also said that following a strategic and execution review it has appointed advisers to consider and pursue various transformational strategic options to extract the best value for stakeholders.\nThe company aims to continue to make significant cost reductions, together with a selective approach to investments, and expects to reduce its fixed cost base by more than 200 million euros ($205.90 million) by FY2025-26 versus FY2022-23 on an annualised basis.\nIt expects third-quarter net bookings at around 300 million euros, primarily reflecting lower than expected Holiday sales, mainly for Star Wars Outlaws, as well as the discontinuation of XDefiant.\nIn October, the game maker expected the net bookings for the third quarter to be down about 39% year-on-year to about 380 million euros.\nStay informed with access to our award-winning journalism.\nAvoid misinformation with trusted, accurate reporting.\nMake smarter decisions with insights that matter.",

    "text": "Authorities are attempting to locate a man believed to have been shot earlier this week who is suspected in a burglary. An arrest warrant has been obtained for Jessie Ray Curtis, 36, on charges of first-degree burglary and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The Warren County Sheriff's Office said that Curtis is believed to have sustained a gunshot wound in his back Monday morning during an exchange of gunfire on Ella Way. Anyone with information about Curtis' whereabouts is asked to call 911 and report his location. A post on the WCSO Facebook page said that Curtis may be armed and should not be approached. The search for Murphy is tied to an investigation that began when deputies received a call about a crash on Murphy Road, with the caller reporting that one of the vehicles involved was attempting to leave the scene. As deputies responded, another call came reporting a shooting on Ella Way, and WCSO determined that the two calls were part of a related incident. After a disturbance and exchange of gunfire on Ella Way, more shots were exchanged as vehicles involved in the disturbance traveled along Murphy Road, the sheriff's office said. Witnesses to the crash on Murphy Road said several people took off running from the scene in different directions, and a black Buick Enclave was also seen leaving the scene and traveling toward Ky. 240, according to WCSO. Deputies later found the car abandoned in a barn along Vance Lane. Law enforcement canvassed the area and located Joshua Culbreath, 38, who was served with outstanding warrants and charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. An arrest citation for Culbreath alleged that he arrived at his Ella Way home on Monday morning as a burglary was ongoing and he went to the front door armed with a handgun. Witnesses reported that Culbreath got into a verbal confrontation with a man, gunshots were exchanged and Culbreath drove off in a black Buick SUV, while the \"unknown males\" that illegally entered the home fled in a black Chevrolet Avalanche. \"Witnesses stated Culbreath was firing shots from the Buick SUV and wrecked out the Avalanche,\" Culbreath's arrest citation said. Culbreath gave some statements to deputies about his involvement in the incident and then requested an attorney, court records show. Another Ella Way resident, Jess Fitzgerald, 33, was arrested on charges of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and trafficking in marijuana (less than eight ounces, firearm enhanced). Fitzgerald called 911 to report two people entered his residence armed and that someone had been shot, according to court records. Deputies found Fitzgerald outside his residence, where he complained of chest pains after learning he had warrants for his arrest, a citation said. Fitzgerald reported that one of the intruders began to handcuff him and that he was placed on his knees in the kitchen when an altercation began and shots were fired, Fitzgerald's arrest citation said. Deputies obtained a search warrant for Fitzgerald's residence and found three bags of suspected marijuana, several firearms, a sawed-off shotgun, two heavy-plated ballistic vests and parts to an AR-15, the citation said.",

    "text": "The Netflix True Story Thriller That Grips You And Doesn’t Let Go\nAn action thriller released earlier this year, The Engineer is based on real events, covering one of the most unsettling and dramatic times in the recent history of Israel. Set in the mid-1990s, the film tells the story of the Shabak hunt for Yehiyah Ayyash, known as “The Engineer.” He was the bomb maker responsible for a series of bus bombs that killed Israeli civilians.\nThe Engineer tells the story of the hunt for Ayyash from the perspective of agents in Shin Bet, the Israel Security Agency.\nThe Engineer was released globally earlier this year and came from Israeli-born director Danny Abeckaser and Israeli producer Yoav Gross. It premiered in March at Mammoth California’s International Film Festival. Abeckaser, who is also an actor and screenwriter, was born in Israel, where he lived until he was nine years old.\nAfter Abeckaser’s family moved to Brooklyn, he grew up to become a nightclub promoter in New York City, later becoming a filmmaker. He shot The Engineer entirely in Israel, and did so for the purpose of telling an important story in his native country’s history.\nHe says he considers himself a storyteller first and was drawn to the events of these suicide bus bombs, which threatened the lives of innocent people inside Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.\nAlong with American actors like Robert Davi and star Emile Hirsch, the film also includes many Arab and Israeli actors who had never before had English-speaking roles.\nTelling the story of the terrorist actions of The Engineer was important for Abeckaser, who wanted to shed light on the motivations behind the bombings, even as he says clearly that terrorism is wrong and unacceptable. The film cleverly incorporates archival and news footage from key events during the timeline of the story from 1993 to 1996. Using a combination of real footage and newly-filmed recreations, it seeks to put audiences into the events as they took place.\nThe Engineer tells the story of the hunt for Ayyash from the perspective of agents in Shin Bet, the Israel Security Agency. The story follows, among other things, the high-risk infiltration of Gaza by the top-secret Mistaharavim unit that was sent to hunt for the bomber. The film also highlights the signing of the Oslo Accords, which came closer than ever to brokering a peaceful coexistence between Palestine and Israel.\nAbeckaser also wanted to use The Engineer as an opportunity to make a film that included a cast and crew from Israeli, Arab, and American backgrounds. Along with American actors like Robert Davi and star Emile Hirsch, the film also includes many Arab and Israeli actors who had never before had English-speaking roles. Streaming on\nNetflix, the film has brought these actors to an international audience they had not yet had the opportunity to reach.\nSet in the mid-1990s, the film tells the story of the Shabak hunt for Yehiyah Ayyash, known as “The Engineer.”\nThe Engineer also gave Abeckaser the chance to accomplish his goal of providing local actors with the chance to open up their career opportunities by being featured in a movie that would be seen around the world. For example, Director of Photography\nBarry Markowitz is a recent Israeli immigrant who can now add a Hollywood film to his resume.\nWhile his first goal is to entertain, Abeckaser also sought with this film to bring an international story, cast, and crew to a wide audience.\nThe Engineer is streaming now on Netflix.",
