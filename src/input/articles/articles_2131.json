    "title": "Aurora Ferry's Pioneering Decontamination: A Leap Forward in Maritime Safety and Environmental Stewardship",
    "text": "In an era where environmental consciousness is not just a choice but a mandate, the maritime industry takes a significant leap forward. The Aurora ferry, operated by Scanunit, a maritime engineering specialist, recently became the pioneering vessel to undergo a complete replacement and decontamination of its firefighting system, which contained the hazardous chemicals PFAS and PFOS. This groundbreaking endeavor not only marks a pivotal point in maritime safety practices but also sets a precedent for environmental responsibility worldwide.\nBreaking New Ground in Environmental Stewardship\nThe project was initiated in response to an IMO resolution aiming to phase out firefighting foams that use PFOS, known for their detrimental effects on human health and the environment. The Aurora's firefighting system, which previously relied on Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) containing PFAS and PFOS, was identified as a potential risk not just to the vessel's crew but to marine life and ecosystems. Scanunit's successful decontamination process involved the meticulous removal of 200 liters of AFFF foam, cleaning of 200 meters of pipelines, and the replacement of 52 spray nozzles. This extensive operation culminated in the system being refilled with a fluorine-free foam concentrate, a move that significantly mitigates the environmental hazards associated with traditional firefighting foams.\nThe Hazards of PFAS and PFOS\nThe use of AFFF in firefighting systems has been a longstanding practice, credited for its effectiveness in extinguishing combustible liquid fires. However, the dark side of these chemicals, particularly PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) and PFOS (Perfluorooctane sulfonate), has come to light in recent years. Classified as carcinogenic, these substances have been linked to an increased risk of testicular cancer among military personnel and firefighters, among other health concerns. The urgency to find safer alternatives has been underscored by ongoing lawsuits and stringent regulations put forth by entities such as the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to curb the environmental and health risks posed by these toxic chemicals.\nA Milestone for the Maritime Industry\nThe successful replacement and decontamination of the Aurora's firefighting system represent more than just an operational upgrade. It embodies a significant environmental milestone, demonstrating the feasibility and imperative of transitioning to eco-friendly alternatives in maritime operations. The project's completion, which saw the systems' contamination levels fall well below the 1 ppm restriction set by both the ECHA and EPA, not only exemplifies Scanunit's commitment to innovation but also serves as a compelling call to action for the industry at large. The implications of this achievement extend beyond the confines of the Aurora, offering a blueprint for vessels worldwide to mitigate their environmental footprint without compromising safety.\nIn light of the increasing health and environmental concerns associated with PFAS chemicals, the maritime industry's move towards safer firefighting solutions is both timely and critical. The Aurora's project not only highlights the technological capabilities and environmental dedication of Scanunit but also sets a new standard for maritime safety and environmental stewardship. As the industry continues to navigate the challenging waters of sustainability and safety, the successful decontamination and replacement effort aboard the Aurora ferry shines as a beacon of hope and progress. This initiative underscores the urgent need to address contamination issues head-on while pushing the boundaries of what's possible in maritime safety practices, paving the way for a future where the ocean's guardians no longer have to choose between efficacy and ecology.",

    "text": "Peer review is a central feature of academic work. It’s the process through which research ends up published in an academic journal: independent experts scrutinise the work of another researcher in order to recommend if it should be accepted by a publisher and if and how it should be improved.\nPeer review is often assumed to guarantee quality, but it doesn’t always work well in practice. Every academic has their own peer-review horror stories, ranging from years-long delays to multiple tedious rounds of revisions. The cycle continues until the article is accepted somewhere or until the author gives up.\nOn the other side, the work of reviewing is voluntary and also invisible. Reviewers, who often remain anonymous, go unrewarded and unrecognised, even though their work is an essential part of research communication. Journal editors find recruiting peer reviewers is increasingly difficult.\nAnd we know peer review, however much it is lauded, often does not work. It is sometimes biased , and too often allows errors , or even scholarly fraud , to creep through.\nClearly the peer-review system is broken. It is slow, inefficient and burdensome, and the incentives to carry out a review are low.\nPublish first In recent years, alternative ways to scrutinise research have emerged which attempt to fix some of the problems with the peer-review system. One of these is the “publish, review, curate” model.\nThis reverses the traditional review-then-publish model. An article is first published online, then peer reviewed. While this approach is too new to understand how it compares with traditional publishing, there is optimism about its promise, suggesting that increased transparency in the review process would speed scientific progress.\nWe have set up a platform using the publish, review, curate model for the field of metaresearch – research about the research system itself. Our aims are both to innovate peer review in our field and to study this innovation as a metaresearch experiment of sorts. This initiative will help us to understand how we can improve peer review in ways that we hope will have implications for other fields of research.\nThe platform, called MetaROR (MetaResearch Open Review), has just been launched. It is a partnership between an academic society, the Association for Interdisciplinary Meta-Research and Open Science, and a non-profit metaresearch accelerator, the Research on Research Institute.\nIn the case of MetaROR, authors first publish their work on a preprint server. Preprints are versions of research papers made available by their authors before peer review as a way of accelerating the dissemination of research. Preprinting has been common in a few academic disciplines for decades, but increased in others during the pandemic as a way of getting science into the public domain faster. MetaROR, in effect, builds a peer-review service on top of preprint servers.\nAuthors submit their work to MetaROR by providing MetaROR with a link to their preprinted article. A managing editor then recruits peer reviewers who are experts on the article’s object of study, its research methods, or both. Reviewers with competing interests are excluded whenever possible, and disclosure of competing interests is mandatory.\nThe publish, review, curate model provides the opportunity to build a more collaborative, transparent process. Gorodenkoff/Shutterstock Peer review is conducted openly, with the reviews made available online. This makes the work of reviewers visible, reflecting the fact that review reports are contributions to scholarly communication in their own right.\nWe hope that reviewers will increasingly see their role as engaging in a scholarly conversation in which they are a recognised participant, although MetaROR still allows reviewers to choose whether to be named or not. Our hope is that most reviewers will find it beneficial to sign their reviews and that this will significantly reduce the problem of anonymous dismissive or otherwise bad-faith reviews.\nSince articles submitted to MetaROR are already publicly available, peer review can focus on engaging with an article with a view to improving it. Peer review becomes a constructive process, rather than one that valorises gatekeeping.\nEvidence suggests preprints and final articles actually differ surprisingly little, but improvements can often be made. The publish, review, curate model helps authors engage with reviewers.\nFollowing the review process, authors are left to decide whether to revise their article and how. In the MetaROR model, authors can also choose to submit their article to a journal. To offer authors a streamlined experience, MetaROR is collaborating with several journals who commit to using MetaROR reviews in their own review process.\nLike other publish, review, curate platforms, MetaROR is an experiment. We will need to evaluate it to understand its successes and failures. We hope others will too, so we can learn how best to organise the dissemination and evaluation of scientific research – without, we hope, too many peer-review horror stories.\nResearch Universities Peer review Preprints Give me perspective",

    "title": "Mark Driscoll Blasts “He Gets Us” Campaign",
    "text": "The “He Gets Us” campaign continues to experience criticism for what some Christians are claiming is an inaccurate portrayal of Jesus. Mark Driscoll weighed in on the controversy, initially posting to his\nX account, “Jesus washed Judas’s feet and still sent him to hell.” He took to https://twitter.com/PastorMark/status/1757971132190453965 post, Driscoll wrote, “Some of you are going to hell, and Christians need to know that having clean feet on your way there won’t be much of an upgrade. Preach repentance.” He included the hashtag “HeGetsUs” paired with “ButDoWeGetHim.”\nThe ad has received its share of\ncriticism and praise across the board. Conservative commentator Michael Knowles of The Daily Wire, shared that even though he understands some of the concerns about the ad, he isn’t “totally opposed” to it. “Am I the only conservative Christian who didn’t totally hate the ‘He Gets Us’ ad? Yes, it speaks ‘woke-ese.’ It’s not for us; it’s for secular libs. There’s a risk it leads to heretical complacency. But if it gets some lost lib even to consider Our Lord, I’m not totally opposed,” wrote Knowles. Managing editor at the Babylon Bee, Joel Berry, who had his own strong condemnation against the ad, disagreed with Knowles’s take but did agree that God could use it. “It’s not likely to win secular libs to the real Jesus, but it will definitely give them fuel to continue using Jesus as a secular lib mascot. That said, we can still pray that what man intends for evil, God will use for good,” he https://twitter.com/JoelWBerry/status/1757035766176206968.\nDriscoll himself had his own past failures dragged up after stepping into the fray. One user responded to his post with, “As a former member of Mars Hill, it astonishes me that anyone still listens you.” Driscoll was famously outed from the Mars Hill megachurch after accusations of bullying and an abusive work environment in 2014. His departure led to Mars Hill shutting down as well, with “\nThe Rise and Fall of Mars Hill” podcast topping the charts in 2021. <a href=\"https://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/news/2024/02/is-the-end-of-the-world-on-the-horizon-cellphone-outage-affects-emergency-services-nationwide\">\nRead Previous Post\nIs the End of the World On the Horizon?
