    "title": "Top 10 rarest Fortnite skins in 2024 - Dot Esports",
    "text": "Looking good in Fortnite is one of the biggest things you have to worry about before you jump into a match. With so many skins to pick from in this massive battle royale, you might not want to pick your favorite but the rarest skin you’ve unlocked while playing.\nThere are multiple rare skins that have appeared in Fortnite over the years, and these were only offered for a limited time. If you have one of these rare skins on your account, donning them to show off in a battle royale match is always a good idea. Some rare skins may be ones players have never heard about before. These are some of the rarest skins you can own in Fortnite.\nAerial Assault Trooper Image via Epic Games The Aerial Assault Trooper initially appeared during Fortnite season one. It was available for 1,200 V-bucks , and you had to reach at least level 15 in the Season Shop before the skin became available. Although the skin is not fancy compared to some that have come to Fortnite now, because of how few players have this skin on their account, it’s one of the rarer ones to see in the game, and we’d love to see if it could appear again sometime in the future, potentially with a rework.\nBlack Knight Image via Epic Games When Fortnite players think of a rare skin you could have, many immediately think of the Black Knight. The Black Knight was a character that appeared during Season 2 of Fortnite , and was a level 70 reward on the season’s battle pass. There have been several iterations of this skin, such as a unique twist on the outfit for Fortnite ‘s OG Season , but nothing that matches the eerie black and silver armor suit with glowing red eyes. Outside of participating in Season 2 of Fortnite and unlocking the skin, it has not appeared in the game since.\nBlue Team Leader Image via Epic Games For Fortnite players playing on PlayStation, the Blue Team Leader skin was another opportunity to grab an exclusive item. The Blue Team Leader skin appeared when Epic Games promoted Fortnite on PlayStation, and it was available to PlayStation Plus subscribers who had access to the game. It was called the PlayStation Plus Celebration Pack, and you could grab it on the PlayStation store. However, that promotion has since been pulled, and the Blue Team Leader skin has not been openly available since February 2018.\nEon Image via Microsoft The Eon skin was initially released during Fortnite’s Season 6 and was in partnership with Epic Games and Microsoft. You can still purchase this skin if you’re willing to buy the Xbox One S 1 TB console, which you can find on Amazon but features a different appearance from the original Eon. Microsoft promoted the original bundle for $299.99, but the price has gone up as the console and promotion have been discontinued.\nGalaxy Image via Epic Games A partnership between Samsung and Epic Games for Fortnite brought about the Galaxy skin, a character that looks like they were dropped directly from space. Fortnite players had a chance to unlock this skin if they played at least three games while using their Note 9 and Tab4 tablets, and if you did not have those devices and never played the game, you couldn’t unlock the Galaxy skin. The Galaxy is exceptionally rare because of the time constraints on the promotional event and the devices required to unlock it.\nGolden Agent Peely Image via Epic Games For those who wanted to push themselves during Fortnite Chapter 2: Season 2, there’s the Golden Agent Peely skin. The skin was available in the battle pass, but you had to reach level 300 to unlock it. If you had the time and patience to unlock it before Chapter 2: Season 2 arrived, the skin would be available for you to use. It’s an exceptionally rare skin because of the amount of time you would have had to dedicate to unlock it, despite how long Fortnite seasons usually go .\nHonor Guard Image via Epic Games In a promotion between Epic Games and Honor, the Honor Guard skin is one of the rarer and more expensive skins you can find in Fortnite . If you wanted this skin, you had to buy the Honor View 20, a phone that cost $650 in January 2019 when it was released, and the Honor Guard skin became available in February 2019 for anyone who grabbed the promotional code. Outside of this promotion, the Honor Guard skin has not appeared in Fortnite , making it an exceptionally rare skin and one of the odder promotions Epic Games has done for Fortnite players. What made this skin even more rare was that the promotion was not worldwide.\nThe Reaper Image via Epic Games One of my favorite skins is The Repear, and many Fortnite players refer to this character as “John Wick,” who looks eerily similar to the character played by Keanu Reaves. Many people believe it’s the best Fortnite skin available. However, it’s important to note that this skin differs from the John Wick skin released in Season 9 to promote the third John Wick film. The Reaper appeared in Fortnite during Season 3 and was the tier 100 reward for the battle pass.\nReflex Image via Epic Games The Reflex skin was created during Fortnite ‘s Season 7, and you could grab it from the item shop for 1,200 V-Bucks in the Counterattack set. However, another way to unlock it was by submitting a code from the GeForce Fortnite Bundle, which was back in 2019. The Reflex outfit has only appeared in the Item Shop twice and was last seen in March 2019. Unless you have a promotional code for the GeForce Fortnite Bundle, we don’t know another way to unlock this rare skin.\nWorld Warrior Image via Epic Games The World Warrior skin appeared during Fortnite ‘s Season 9 and was available in the item shop for 800 V-Bucks. It was one of the items you could unlock for the World Cup 2019 set. It appeared four times in the item shop but only occurred in July 2019. Because the World Warrior skin appeared briefly during this time, it’s a relatively rare skin that only a handful of players had who might have grabbed it before it disappeared.\nAuthor Scott Duwe Staff Writer & Call of Duty lead.

    "title": "EHC Thun’s Cup Semi-Final Loss to Basel: A Dream Shattered",
    "text": "– EHC Thun’s final dream has shattered\nThe Bernese Oberlanders make up a 0-2 deficit against the higher-class Basel, but lose the cup semi-final game in a penalty shootout.\nPublished today at 10:34 p.m\nThun goal celebration after Fabian Boss’ goal.\nPhoto: Markus Grunder\nDespite the defeat: A calendar year that (almost) couldn’t have been better came to an end for EHC Thun on Thursday. First, the Bernese Oberlanders made it to the playoff final in the MyHockey League (MHL) last season. Despite their incredible bad luck with injuries, they are once again doing well in the current championship. Accidents like the 5-0 loss at home against Frauenfeld can happen. And in the Swiss Cup, Thun knocked two higher-class teams, Bellinzona and the GCK Lions, out of the competition.\nThey will be rewarded for this during the festive season with the semi-final game against the strongest possible opponent remaining in this competition. The opponent is EHC Basel, the current leader of the Swiss League.\nPuck throw-in by Hanspeter Latour\nAn interesting comparison between two teams that are at the top of their leagues and have one thing in common. Neither club wants to get promoted. Not this season. “We’re not ready for it yet. “But everything could look different in a year,” says Basel’s sports director Kevin Schläpfer before the game in Grabengut. The Swiss League could soon become an issue in Thun too. Maybe in a year too.\nBut celebrations can already be celebrated today. Just in the cup. Hanspeter Latour is present and opens the game with the symbolic puck throw-in. In 2004, as coach of Thun’s footballers, Latour defeated FC Basel 4-1 in a memorable game. Can the ice hockey team do the same 19 years later?\nSuddenly Basel leads 2-0\nIn any case, the Basel team take the game and the opponent seriously. You know the qualities of EHC Thun. And he more than holds up for long stretches of the game. Basel is only stronger than the MHL club in the power play, at least for the time being.\nThe EHC Basel is in trouble: Thun is making life difficult for the higher class.\nPhoto: Markus Grunder\nIt is a situation of superiority that gives the guests the lead. The Canadian Jakub Stukel scores. Only 24 seconds have been played in the middle third. Around three turns of the hand, Basel extends its lead. Stukel can once again be celebrated as a goalscorer.\nThun catching up\nThun defends himself and looks for the next goal in the absence of head coach Daniel Steiner. Steiner is currently with the U17 national team at the\nWorld Cup in Finland. Assistant coach Hans Bosshardt is on the boards in the Cup semi-finals.\nMichael Bärtschi only hits the edge of the goal (38th). But then the disc is in. Fabian Boss brings hope back 1:13 minutes before the second half-time siren. Mathys Mojonnier finally equalizes (52nd). The majority of the 1,741 spectators are enthusiastic. Thun is close to 3:2. But there is an extension. Keeper Stephan Küenzi saves the home team from a penalty shootout. In this respect, only Nocola Christen is successful in the Bernese Oberland. Basel scores twice and, like Olten, who narrowly defeated Seewen, is in the cup final.\nRead more: U.S. Senate Passes All-American Flag Act: Ensuring American-made Flags for Federal Government Purchases\nFound an error?

    "text": "Un tatuaje es para toda la vida por lo que la decisión de hacerse uno no debe tomarse a la ligera, especialmente cuando se trata de diseños que hacen alusión a alguna pareja sentimental. Y sino que se lo digan a Aitana. “Te conocí con diecinueve, besos van y besos vienen, para qué vuelvo a ese bar si está frio como nieve y no estás tú (...) Fue por idiota que yo me hice ese tatu , pero ahora no estás tú ”, entona la cantante en su canción ‘Dos extraños’.\nPero, ¿de cuál de todos sus tatuajes habla la extriunfita? La letra de este hit nos da todas las pistas. Y es que el protagonista de ‘Dos extraños’ no es otro que Miguel Bernardeau, el actor de ‘Élite’ con el que tuvo una relación sentimental cuando tenía precisamente diecinueve años. Por aquel entonces, en ese romance que duró cuatro años y en el que llegaron a convivir en una casa en Madrid, Aitana se tatuó en el costado derecho la letra ‘M’ en honor al nombre de su pareja.\ndónde tiene una M tatuada?\n— 🏳️‍🌈 (@_ivlg) March 6, 2021 A la intérprete de ‘Las babys’ no le sirvió con reconocer públicamente su arrepentimiento a través de la música sino que también quiso poner remedio a esta situación. Al poco tiempo de romper con el hijo de Ana Duato, Aitana fue vista entrando en un centro especializado en la eliminación de tatuajes mediante una técnica laser por lo que ya no queda ni rastro de esa ‘M’.\nMuy cercana a la familia Bernardeau Si bien la relación de Aitana y Miguel no llegó a buen puerto en 2022, la artista continúa teniendo un vínculo muy cercano con la familia Bernardeau que le está sirviendo de refugio tras su segunda ruptura con Sebastián Yatra en poco menos de un año. Y es que la joven y María, su excuñada, se han dejado ver por Ibiza juntas disfrutando de unos días de merecidas vacaciones.",

    "title": "As hybrid offices look to offload unused furniture, HR has a hand in eco-friendly solutions - WorkLife",
    "text": "With hybrid work leaving half-empty offices saddled with tons of unused desks and chairs, companies are looking for alternatives to shipping it off to landfills — and HR can play an essential role.\nGetting gently used commercial furniture into the hands of community organizations and others who need it requires planning, collaboration, creativity and expertise, according to a new research paper from commercial furniture solutions company Installnet and Bard College’s MBA program in sustainability. Doing so also benefits from the buy-in of company leaders and employees, with HR often the common link, suggested Dale Ewing, CEO of Installnet.\n“One of the biggest challenges is thinking that it’s easier than it is. A lot of companies out there say they can do this, and most don’t do it well,” said Dale Ewing, CEO of Installnet, which has a full-time outreach team that partners with clients to get unwanted items like desks, chairs and conference tables into the hands of those who most need it.\nBeyond community service and helping the environment, such projects can be a way for employees to feel more connected, Ewing noted. “From an HR standpoint, you talk about engagement, you talk about culture, you talk about purpose and having a real connection to something that’s really great,” he said. “There’s a real value for employees to be involved.”\n“From an HR standpoint, you talk about engagement, you talk about culture, you talk about purpose and having a real connection to something that’s really great. There’s a real value for employees to be involved.” Dale Ewing, CEO of Installnet. Since 2012, Installnet’s Ecoserv program has diverted more than 52 million pounds of waste from landfills to groups in more than 3,200 communities. The donations help local nonprofits, schools, first responders and others devote more resources to their missions and reduce greenhouse gas emissions that worsen climate change.\nEach year, more than 146 million tons of solid waste goes to landfills in the U.S., generating dangerous methane gas emissions that worsen climate change — the equivalent of 20.3 million passenger cars on the road, according to the EPA. An estimated 9 million tons, close to half of that waste, is furniture.\nThe paper cites several examples of decommission projects that successfully matched unused furniture and other assets to community organizations. In Oregon and Maryland, for example, 90,000 pieces of furniture in two warehouses were dispersed across six weeks via resale and donations, keeping it out of the public dump.\nDave Corsones, president of MOI, an office furniture dealer based in Baltimore, related that when refreshing its home base, it ended up with perfectly good desks, chairs and other materials people could still make use of — even if it meant more effort on the company’s part. “Rather than hitting the easy button and just tearing it all down and sending it off to a landfill, we wanted to figure out how to try and do our very best to divert everything through a combination of employees, sale, donation and efficient recycling,” he said.\n“Rather than hitting the easy button and just tearing it all down and sending it off to a landfill, we wanted to figure out how to try and do our very best to divert everything through a combination of employees, sale, donation and efficient recycling.\" Dave Corsones, president of MOI, an office furniture dealer based in Baltimore. The result: MOI, with the aid of Installnet, diverted 22 tons of furniture to local nonprofits like the Baltimore City Schools, Habitat for Humanity and Bridges Baltimore.\nIt wasn’t just the right thing to do, he said — it was smart business, according to Corsones, who called it “a really great opportunity for us to put the goals we had as an organization sustainability-wise into practice.”\nRachel Lazo, chief of staff at Bridges Baltimore, said the donation was instrumental in helping the nonprofit, which serves local youth, expand its offices and meeting spaces. “We have to fundraise for every dollar in our operating budget, every year,” she explained. “If we had to buy furniture it would affect what we put toward programs and services. We’re serving 440 young people, and we want our budget to go to serving those 440 young people.”\nShe added that the used furniture “will see a long second life here. I’m talking to you from behind my donated desk right now, and I love it.”",

    "text": "Nach Vandalismus an der Grundschule: Kann auch in Nortorf Videoüberwachung helfen?\nHausmeister Michael Brandt und Schulleiterin Astrid Krüger sind genervt von der \"sinnlosen\" Zerstörtungswut.\nQuelle: Greta Weber\nNortorf. Schönberg, Schönkirchen, Heikendorf, Kiel – und bald auch Nortorf? Aufgrund von Vandalismus wird an immer mehr Schulen über eine mögliche Videoüberwachung diskutiert.\nDass außerhalb der Schulzeiten Menschen auf dem Schulhof herumlungern, ist nichts Neues, doch in letzter Zeit häufen sich die Fälle von Vandalismus: Immer wieder wurden an der Grundschule Nortorf Scheiben eingeworfen, den Holzpferden auf dem Schulhof wurden die Köpfe abgeschlagen, und zuletzt wurde das Fahrrad einer Lehrerin völlig demoliert aufgefunden.\n„Sowas ist doch wirklich total sinnlos“, sagt Schulleiterin Astrid Krüger. Inzwischen passiere gefühlt fast jedes Wochenende etwas. „Auch die Kinder können das überhaupt nicht verstehen, dass jemand ihren Schulhof so demoliert.“\nGlasscherben, kaputte Fenster, zerstörte Holzpferde: Immer wieder Vandalismus an der Grundschule Nortorf\nHausmeister Michael Brandt dreht montagmorgens immer eine Kontrollrunde über den Schulhof, ihm fallen die neuesten Vandalismus-Fälle also meist zuerst auf. Außerdem sammelt er jedes Mal eine ganze Menge Glasscherben auf.\n„Schon zwei- oder dreimal sind die Pferde jetzt kaputtgemacht worden“, erzählt er. „Mindestens alle zwei Wochen ist irgendwas.“ Unzählige kaputte Fenster hat er schon Polizei und Stadt gemeldet – Letzterer gehört das Schulgebäude.\nEine Lehrerin ließ ihr Fahrrad über Nacht an der Schule stehen. Das ist das Ergebnis: Es ist völlig ramponiert.\nQuelle: Greta Weber\nSeit vier Jahren arbeitet er an der Grundschule. In dem Zeitraum hat er schon diverse Bänke entfernt, die an regengeschützten Stellen standen, um den Aufenthalt auf dem Schulhof weniger attraktiv zu machen.\nAuch die Polizei habe schon vermehrt nach dem Rechten auf dem Schulhof gesehen – immerhin liegt die Polizeistation direkt neben der Grundschule. Geholfen hat es bisher nicht.\nVideoüberwachung gegen Vandalismus? Nortorf will Möglichkeiten prüfen\nJetzt soll geprüft werden, ob eine Videoüberwachung auf dem Gelände möglich ist. Das könnte einerseits abschreckend wirken, andererseits bei der Aufklärung der Schadensfälle helfen. „Wir informieren uns gerade über die Kosten und die einzuhaltenden Vorschriften“, erklärte Nortorfs Bürgermeister Torben Ackermann (CDU) diese Woche in der Stadtverordnetenversammlung.\nDenn klar ist auch: Wenn es um Videoüberwachung geht, müssen Richtlinien in Sachen Datenschutz eingehalten werden. Welche Interessen gilt es hier gegeneinander aufzuwiegen?\n„Natürlich ist eine Überwachungskamera ein heikles Thema“, bestätigt auch die Schulleiterin. Die Kameras dürften natürlich nur zu bestimmten Zeiten aufzeichnen, um keine Datenschutzrechte zu verletzen.\nAnderswo, wo schon seit Jahren Kameras hängen, ist diese Frage auch nachträglich weiter diskutiert worden. Zum Beispiel in Schönkirchen (ebenfalls Kreis Plön), wo seit Jahren Kameras am Schulzentrum angebracht sind. Die gleiche Diskussion führt man auch in der Gemeinde Heikendorf im Kreis Plön.\nImmer mehr Beschwerden wegen Videoüberwachung in SH\nDa Videokameras immer weiter verbreitet sind, steigen auch in Schleswig-Holstein die Streitfälle zu dem Thema an. Beim Unabhängigen Landeszentrum für Datenschutz gingen im vergangenen Jahr 352 Beschwerden wegen Videoüberwachung ein.\nDass Videoüberwachung durchaus etwas bringen kann, zeigt sich Jahr für Jahr in Neumünster, wo seit 2023 Kameras aufzeichnen, was im Park Klosterinsel vor sich geht. Das steigere nicht nur das Sicherheitsbewusstsein der Menschen, sondern wirke auch vorbeugend und helfe bei der Strafverfolgung, heißt es aus Neumünster.\nSobald klar ist, was in Sachen Videoüberwachung an der Grundschule Nortorf möglich ist, wird die Politik die endgültige Entscheidung zu fällen haben. Immerhin fallen hier auch Kosten an. Aber zurzeit muss eben auch regelmäßig ein Glaser kommen, um immer wieder neue Scheiben einzusetzen.\nKN",

L’oferta de la companyia de Jeff Bezos se sabia quan faltaven pocs dies perquè, aquest dissabte, venci el termini perquè la propietària xinesa de l’aplicació de vídeos curts, ByteDance, es desprengui de la plataforma. Altrament, TikTok hauria de cessar totes les operacions que du a terme als EUA.\nTambé van presentar una oferta per la xarxa social la start-up Zoop, dirigida per Tim Stokely, el fundador d’OnlyFans, i la fundació Hbar, que administra la tresoreria de la xarxa de criptomonedes Hedera. Aquestes dues firmes van informar de l’oferta ahir. \"La nostra aposta per TikTok no consisteix només a canviar la propietat, sinó a crear un nou paradigma en què tant els creadors com les seves comunitats es beneficiïn del valor que generin\", va explicar a l’agència Reuters RJ Phillips, cofundador de Zoop.\nPrecisament ahir el president nord-americà, Donald Trump, va encapçalar una reunió a la Casa Blanca en la qual va analitzar diferents ofertes per a la venda de l’aplicació amb 170 milions d’usuaris nord-americans. D’acord amb les cadenes NBC i CBS News, que esmentaven fonts de l’Administració, Trump tenia previst parlar amb els seus assessors sobre les propostes que s’havien presentat.\nNotícies relacionadesSeguretat nacional\nSi no es consuma la venda, entrarà en vigor una llei aprovada pel Congrés l’any passat que obligaria l’app a cessar les operacions als EUA al·legant preocupacions de seguretat nacional per la seva vinculació amb la Xina. A més d’Amazon, entre els possibles inversors interessats hiha Blackstone i Oracle, i altres firmes de capital privat, capital de risc i importants actors del sector tecnològic, segons la CBS.",

    "text": "Gefahr aus dem Erdorbit: Warum Weltraumschrott immer mehr zur Bedrohung wird\nMehr Raketenstarts bedeuten auch mehr Weltraumschrott im Erdorbit. Doch was passiert, wenn dieser auf die Erde stürzt oder den Orbit unbenutzbar macht?\nMünchen – Jedes Jahr fliegen mehr Raketen ins Weltall – und das meiste von dem, was die Erde verlässt, kommt irgendwann auch wieder zur Erde zurück. Manche Raketenteile fallen bereits kurz nach dem Start auf die Erde und verglühen in der Atmosphäre, andere benötigen einige Jahre, bis sie\nmit einem Absturz auf die Erde „entsorgt“ werden. Die sowjetische Raumsonde „Kosmos 482“ beispielsweise umkreiste die Erde 53 Jahre lang, bevor sie um den 10. Mai 2025 herum abstürzen wird.\nWeltraumschrott als Gefahr: Kessler-Syndrom oder Absturz auf die Erde\nDerzeit umkreisen mehr Satelliten als je zuvor den blauen Planeten in einer niedrigen Umlaufbahn (LEO) – und dazu kommt auch immer mehr Weltraumschrott. Ein\nneuer Bericht der europäischen Raumfahrtorganisation Esa zeigt, dass im Jahr 2024 ganze 1200 „intakte Objekte“ wieder in die Erdatmosphäre eingetreten sind – neben unzähligen kleineren Schrottteilen. Rund um die steigende Menge an Weltraumschrott gibt es gleich mehrere Befürchtungen:\n- Kessler-Syndrom: Befindet sich zu viel Weltraumschrott im Erdorbit, kann davon irgendwann eine „Massenkarambolage“ ausgehen. Schrotteilchen kollidieren, was eine Kaskade weiterer Kollisionen nach sich zieht, die auch aktive Satelliten oder die Internationale Raumstation ISS gefährden kann. Durch dieses Phänomen, das sogenannte\n„Kessler-Syndrom“, kann der Erdorbit für lange Zeit unbenutzbar werden, warnen Fachleute.\n- Absturz auf die Erde: Der meiste Weltraumschrott, der auf die Erde stürzt, verglüht in der Erdatmosphäre. Doch es gibt Teile, die nicht vollständig verglühen und auf die Erde stürzen könnten. Zwar ist ein großer Teil der Erde von Wasser bedeckt, doch es wurde schon Weltraumschrott in der Nähe von Siedlungen gefunden, ein Stück einer von der ISS abgeworfenen Batterie\ndurchschlug ein Hausdach in Florida. Menschen kamen durch Weltraumschrott bisher nicht zu Schaden, doch dieses Risiko könnte mit zunehmenden Raketenstarts weiter steigen.\nVerglühende Satelliten können die Atmosphäre verändern\nEin weiteres\nRisiko durch Weltraumschrott ist nicht ganz so naheliegend, wird von Forschenden jedoch aufmerksam beobachtet: Der Wiedereintritt von Weltraumschrott in die Erdatmosphäre setzt Stoffe frei, die dort nicht hingehören. Satelliten bestehen größtenteils aus Aluminium, das beim Verbrennen in der Atmosphäre zu Aluminiumoxid wird. Dieses Aluminiumoxid beschleunigt den Abbau von Ozon und kann zu thermischen Veränderungen in der oberen Atmosphäre beitragen.\nEin Forschungsteam hat sich das in einer Simulation genauer angeschaut und untersucht, wie sich das Aluminium in der Atmosphäre verhält. „Wir stellen fest, dass sich das Wiedereintrittsaerosol in hohen Breitengraden innerhalb von ein bis drei Jahren nach Beginn der Emissionen in der Stratosphäre ansammeln kann. Außerdem ist die Strahlungswirkung groß genug, um das stratosphärische Temperaturprofil, die Dynamik und die Ozonkonzentration zu beeinflussen“, schreibt das Forschungsteam um Christopher Maloney (NOAA) in der Studie, die\nim Fachjournal JGR Atmospheres publiziert wurde.\nForschungsteam fordert weitere Untersuchung von verglühenden Satelliten\nDie Forschenden betonen „die Notwendigkeit, das Thema Satellitenwiedereintritt weiter zu untersuchen“. Schließlich habe man für die Studie zahlreiche Annahmen treffen müssen und benötige dringend „Beobachtungen in der realen Welt“. Das sei auch nötig, da die Raumfahrt-Technologien „immer weiter fortschreiten und kosteneffizienter werden“, schreibt das Forschungsteam. Die Kosteneffizienz sorgt beispielsweise dafür, dass immer mehr Satellitenkonstellationen im Erdorbit entstehen sollen. SpaceX hat derzeit mehr als 7000 „Starlink“-Satelliten in der Umlaufbahn – geplant sind alleine für diese Konstellation bis zu 30.000.\nEtwa alle fünf Jahre werden diese Satelliten erneuert, was zu zahlreichen Wiedereintritten und entsprechend viel Aluminiumoxid in der Atmosphäre führt. Das Government Accountability Office (GAO) hat bereits 2020 geschätzt, dass die Anzahl der Satelliten im Erdorbit bis 2040 auf mehr als 60.000 steigen wird – vor allem wegen der Satellitenkonstellationen. Neben „Starlink“ hat auch\nAmazon mit dem Aufbau des „Project Kuiper“ begonnen und China will ebenfalls eine Konstellation aufbauen. (tab)",
