    "text": "PARIS — The thermometer read 95 degrees, but down on the beach volleyball court, with all that gleaming white sand, it felt like 102. The players used a short break to towel off and guzzle water. \"It was really, really hot,\" Carolina Solberg Salgado said. \"I was trying not to think of how [uncomfortable] I was.\" As she and her Brazilian teammate resumed their match against a Lithuanian duo, cheering erupted in a corner of the Eiffel Tower Stadium — a venue worker had stretched a rubber hose into the stands and was spraying the fans. \"It was great,\" said Sean McKinnon of Toronto. \"He hit full-pressure in the face of the poor girl next to us, but I think she appreciated it.\" Weather has been a challenge during the first week of these 2024 Summer Olympics, with conditions veering from one extreme to another. A storm blew in for the opening ceremony, drenching the city with an inch of rain and hanging around long enough to postpone skateboarding the next day. Then came the heat. Researchers worry that Paris represents the latest in an Olympic trend that has winter athletes scrambling to find enough snow and their summertime counterparts facing health risks — cramping, vomiting, heat stroke — caused by peak temperatures. \"We are in a race against time,\" Sebastian Coe, a former Olympian and head of the international track federation, wrote in a report last month. \"Whilst global temperatures continue to rise, climate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport.\" How have athletes described the conditions in France so far? \"A bit of a disaster,\" Irish golfer Shane Lowry said of carrying his team's flag in the soggy opening. After a qualifying round in men's skateboarding, with the evening final still to come, American star Jagger Eaton said he thought to himself, \"Wow, I'm smoked.\" U.S. cyclist Hannah Roberts had a similar experience at the BMX venue. \"I was baking hot,\" she said. \"I felt like a little potato.\" Olympians might not be experts in climatology or conversant in all the relevant political arguments surrounding weather trends, but they have a ground-level view. Skiers and snowboarders have seen firsthand the changes that, according to a 2022 Canadian study, could render all but one of the previous 21 Winter Olympics cities too warm to reliably host downhill races, biathlons and halfpipe competitions by the end of the century. The list includes Palisades Tahoe (formerly Squaw Valley) in California. \"We've gone to sites, and normally we would have snow, but … we were jumping on snow in the pouring rain,\" U.S. aerial skier Winter Vinecki said before the 2022 Beijing Games. Air-conditioned arenas shield gymnasts and some other Summer Games athletes and spectators from the elements. But outdoor events remain vulnerable to average temperatures that, over the past century, have risen about 5 degrees during Olympic months, according to \"Rings of Fire,\" a report published in June by the British Association for Sustainable Sport and an Australian organization called FrontRunners. The issue began drawing attention three years ago at the Tokyo Games, which experts say ranked as the warmest in history with daytime highs in the mid-90s and humidity reaching nearly 70%. The women's marathon was rescheduled for 6 a.m. to take advantage of cooler morning temperatures, and athletes running shorter distances adjusted their warmups to leave time for cooling down before races. At the tennis venue, Paula Badosa of Spain left the quarterfinals in a wheelchair and Daniil Medvedev of Russia needed two medical timeouts, telling the chair umpire: \"I can finish the match, but I can die.\" Since then, the report stated, \"notable cases of extreme heat undermining the health and enjoyment of sporting spectacles have only increased.\" Weather has been a frequent topic of discussion in Paris, as athletes fretted over rain delays early in the competition. When sunny skies returned, the Olympic skate park — made of concrete and shaped like a bowl — became a giant frying pan. Even water sports can be affected. Rowers say they fatigue more quickly in the heat and sailors fight to stay hydrated while spending as many as five hours in their boats. Marathon swimmers must arise in the middle of the night to prepare for open-water contests shifted to early mornings. Many athletes said they spent a week or more training in hot weather to prepare. \"Paris weather is quite unpredictable,\" Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic said after a sweltering match at Roland-Garros Stadium. \"I was getting myself acclimatized possibly for different scenarios.\" When Qatar hosted the 2022 World Cup, officials moved the international soccer tournament from summertime to November through December. Experts say there are other, less-drastic options. Events can be held earlier in the day, and rules can be changed to shorten matches or include more water breaks. British tennis player Jack Draper, for one, said French organizers could do more to help athletes stay hydrated. \"It was pretty poor the way they give [water] bottles to the players,\" Draper said after losing to Taylor Fritz of the U.S. in men's singles. \"The bottles don't stay cool. We were drinking hot water out there.\" Another tennis player, American Coco Gauff, mentioned taking an ice bath after her match. Eaton, the skateboarder who won silver, revealed that his strategy involved keeping two towels at hand and \"just pounding\" drinks. The weather has been just as tough for spectators. On Friday night, they huddled in the rain for hours during the opening ceremony. By Tuesday afternoon at the beach volleyball stadium, they were crowding around misters or laying in the grass behind the grandstands. \"I watched one match, then sat in the shade for one match,\" said Randi Fentress of Fort Worth, Texas. \"Now I'll go back in there.\" The scattered clouds that drifted in a few hours later made Roland-Garros feel like a sauna. An electrical storm soon followed, flickering over the Paris skyline. The forecast called for a change, more rain on the way. ©2024 Los Angeles Times. Visit latimes.com .

    "text": "Japan becomes fifth country to land spacecraft on the moon TOKYO — Japan became the fifth country in history to reach the moon when one of its spacecrafts without astronauts successfully made a soft landing on the lunar surface early Saturday. However, space officials said they need more time to analyze whether the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon, or SLIM, achieved its mission priority of making a pinpoint landing. They also said the craft’s solar panel had failed to generate power, which could shorten its activity on the moon. Space officials believe the SLIM’s small rovers were launched as planned and that data was being transmitted back to Earth, said Hitoshi Kuninaka, head of the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, a unit of Japan’s space agency. But he said that SLIM’s solar battery wasn’t generating power and that it had only a few more hours of battery life. He said that the priority now was for the craft to gather as much data about its landing and the moon as possible on the remaining battery. Japan follows the United States, the Soviet Union, China and India in reaching the moon. Kuninaka said he believes that Japan’s space program at least achieved “minimum” success. SLIM landed on the moon at about 12:20 a.m. Tokyo time on Saturday (1520 GMT Friday). There was a tense wait for news after the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s mission control initially said that SLIM was on the lunar surface, but that it was still “checking its status.” No further details were given until a news conference nearly two hours later. For the mission to be considered fully successful, space officials need to confirm whether SLIM made a pinpoint landing. Kuninaka said that while more time is needed, he personally thinks it was most likely achieved, based on his observation of data showing the spacecraft’s movement until the landing and its ability to transmit signals after landing. SLIM, which was aiming to hit a very small target, is a lightweight spacecraft about the size of a passenger vehicle. It was using “pinpoint landing” technology that promises far greater control than any previous moon landing. While most previous probes have used landing zones about 10 kilometers (six miles) wide, SLIM was aiming at a target of just 100 meters (330 feet). A landing of such precision would be a world’s first, and would be crucial technology for a sustainable, long-term and accurate space probe system, said Hiroshi Yamakawa, president of Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA. Japan needs the technology to secure its place and contribute in international space projects, Yamakawa said. The project was the fruit of two decades of work on precision technology by JAXA. SLIM, nicknamed “the Moon Sniper,” started its descent at midnight Saturday, and within 15 minutes it was down to about 10 kilometers (six miles) above the lunar surface, according to the space agency, which is known as JAXA. At an altitude of five kilometers (three miles), the lander was in a vertical descent mode, then at 50 meters (165 feet) above the surface, SLIM was supposed to make a parallel movement to find a safe landing spot, JAXA said. The spacecraft was testing technology to allow moon missions to land “where we want to, rather than where it is easy to land,” JAXA has said. The spacecraft also was supposed to seek clues about the origin of the moon, including analyzing minerals with a special camera. The SLIM, equipped with a pad each on its five legs to cushion impact, was aiming to land near the Shioli crater, near a region covered in volcanic rock. The closely watched mission came only 10 days after a moon mission by a U.S. private company failed when the spacecraft developed a fuel leak hours after the launch. SLIM was launched on a Mitsubishi Heavy H2A rocket in September. It initially orbited Earth and entered lunar orbit on Dec. 25. Japan hopes to regain confidence for its space technology after a number of failures. A spacecraft designed by a Japanese company crashed during a lunar landing attempt in April, and a new flagship rocket failed its debut launch in March. JAXA has a track record with difficult landings. Its Hayabusa2 spacecraft, launched in 2014, touched down twice on the 900-meter-long (3,000-foot-long) asteroid Ryugu, collecting samples that were returned to Earth. A successful pinpoint landing by SLIM, especially on the moon, would raise Japan’s profile in the global space technology race. Takeshi Tsuchiya, aeronautics professor at the Graduate School of Engineering at the University of Tokyo, said it was important to confirm the accuracy of landing on a targeted area. “It is necessary to show the world that Japan has the appropriate technology in order to be able to properly assert Japan’s position in lunar development,” he said. The moon is important from the perspective of explorations of resources, and it can also be used as a base to go to other planets, like Mars, he said. SLIM was carrying two small autonomous probes – lunar excursion vehicles LEV-1 and LEV-2, which officials say were believed to have been released just before landing. LEV-1, equipped with an antenna and a camera, is tasked with recording SLIM’s landing. LEV-2, is a ball-shaped rover equipped with two cameras, developed by JAXA together with Sony, toymaker Tomy and Doshisha University. Ayaka McGill contributed to this report.",
