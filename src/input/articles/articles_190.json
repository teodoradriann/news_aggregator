    "text": "DELTA — A truck carrying what appears to be heavy construction material has smashed into an overpass in Delta, British Columbia, shutting down the southbound lanes of Highway 99.\nIt's the latest in a rash of overpass collisions that prompted the province to announce harsher penalties for companies and drivers with repeat offences earlier this month.\nDrive BC says the incident south of Vancouver has also blocked traffic in both directions on the 112th Street overpass.\nDelta Fire and Rescue Deputy Chief Dave Wood says the crash caused a \"secondary accident\" involving another vehicle.\nHe says crews were called to the scene at 12:14 p.m. and he didn't know of any injuries.\nPhotos of the aftermath of the incident posted on social media show large girders on the bed of a truck with another laying across the highway along with other debris.\nProvincial statistics say as many as 30 bridge strikes have happened on British Columbia's highways since 2021, with 16 of them reported last year alone.\nThe new rules, announced Dec. 14, include the requirement for dump-style vehicles to have in-cab warning devices by next June, telling drivers if their trailer hasn't been lowered.\nOver-height vehicle fines will increase to $575, up from $115.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nThe Canadian Press",

    "text": "By Justin Tasch ,\n3 hours ago\nJohn Sterling is hopping back on the saddle as the Yankees chase their elusive 28th World Series.\nThe 86-year-old longtime Yankees radio voice, who retired in April, is coming back to call the team’s playoff games for WFAN, he announced on Thursday.\nYankees execs green-lit Sterling’s return last week and Chris Oliviero, who runs WFAN as Audacy New York president, offered Sterling the postseason gig on Thursday, according to The Athletic .\nAaron Boone’s and Brian Cashman’s surprising faith in Alex Verdugo led to Yankees’ divisive Jasson Dominguez decision\n“I miss meeting with all the other broadcasters and writers and people behind the scenes,” Sterling said during WFAN’s “Evan & Tiki” show. “I kind of miss that. And I’ll tell you what I really miss is broadcasting with Suzyn, who is such a fabulous partner and we were together for so long. This will give me a chance at a last hurrah, and work with Suzyn again.”\nSterling, who will reunite with longtime booth partner Suzyn Waldman, will travel for the road games, something The Athletic reports WFAN brass wanted as part of the agreement to temporarily bring him back.\nHow Aaron Boone responded to Alex Verdugo not running out ground ball\nThe Athletic reported two weeks ago that Sterling was set to talk to Oliviero about returning for the playoffs before resuming his retirement.\nSterling began the 2024 season as the Yankees’ radio play-by-player but retired on April 15 , with the Yankees holding an on-field ceremony for him on April 20.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR STARTING LINEUP NEWSLETTER\nEmmanuel Berbari, Rickie Ricardo and Justin Shackil have primarily rotated as the fill-in play-by-play voices, though it remains unclear who will replace Sterling full-time next season.\nJohn Sterling during his Yankees retirement ceremony on April 20, 2024. Robert Sabo for NY Post Sterling said on The Post’s “The Show with Joel Sherman and Jon Heyman” podcast in June that he was “staying out of” the process of determining his replacement.\n“I don’t want to hurt one person for another. I think the kids are doing a great job. No problems,” Sterling said.\nFor the latest in sports, top headlines, breaking news and more, visit nypost.com/sports/\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

    "text": "Capri Sun lovers across the globe are taking to their keyboards in a frenzy after reports emerged the company is allegedly making a big change to its beloved juices. On the days you were lucky enough to get [a packed lunch](https://www.unilad.com/community/man-wife-packed-lunchbox-energy-drink-dangerous-766865-20240828), there was nothing better than popping open your little cube of brightly colored plastic to find a squishy Capri Sun inside. Not only did the pouch offer a delicious few slurps of syrupy, fruity goodness, but the funnest part was trying to stab the plastic straw in the little printed circle towards the top without missing and it slipping off completely, or ending up with a spurt of [juice](https://www.unilad.com/food-and-drink) hitting you right in your face instead. Alas, these sorts of childhood memories may soon be a thing of the past. Advert Instagram snack, food, candy and fast food review account known as Snack-o-lator took to its page yesterday (August 29) to reveal an alleged announcement from Capri Sun. The post reads: \"Capri Sun is coming for the adults with new bottles that will be arriving in stores soon! \"These were announced for the upcoming National Association of Convenience Stores trade show (NACS) show [set to be held in October] and will be in three flavors (at least) to start: Fruit Punch, Strawberry Kiwi, and Pacific Cooler. Advert \"Each bottle is 12oz and won't need you to have to find the spot to poke the straw in and hope that it doesn't come shooting back at you!\" Now, whether this means the bottles will actually replace the pouches altogether who knows - UNILAD has contacted Capri Sun for comment - but Pop Crave [reports](https://x.com/PopCrave/status/1829300816081232236): \"Capri Sun will reduce the number of pouches and transition more to bottles starting in 2025.\" And it's not taken long for fans of the beverages to flock to [social media](https://www.unilad.com/social-media) to weigh in. One Advert A \"There was a line. The line has been crossed. What happens next will be on capri sun’s conscience,\" another added. A third commented: \"Something in my brain has convinced me the taste of Capri Sun has to do with the pouch and straw. This can not be allowed.\" \"The straw poking was 99.8 percent of the fun………\" a fourth added. Advert And a final lamented: \"This was our childhood.\" Topics: [Food and Drink](/food-and-drink), [Social Media](/social-media),",

    "text": "Key Insights:\n- Analysis shows a promising link between shingles vaccination and reduced dementia risk.\n- GSK's Shingrix vaccine gains favor over Merck's Zostavax due to higher efficacy.\n- Analysts project a potential upside for GSK PLC from both price targets and GF Value estimates.\nA recent study highlights a compelling connection between shingles vaccination and brain health, uncovering a 20% reduction in dementia diagnosis among the elderly over a seven-year period. This extensive analysis, conducted using health records of over 282,500 individuals in Wales, underscores the importance of mitigating viral infections for cognitive health. Currently, GSK's (GSK, Financial) Shingrix leads the way as the preferred vaccine due to its superior efficacy, despite an increased incidence of side effects when compared to Merck's (MRK) older Zostavax.\nWall Street Analysts Forecast\nAccording to projections from six financial analysts, GSK PLC (GSK, Financial) is set for an average price target of $39.54 over the next year, with estimates ranging from a high of $45.00 to a low of $35.50. This average target price indicates an anticipated upside of 5.05% from its current trading price of $37.64. For a more in-depth analysis, visit the GSK PLC (GSK) Forecast page.\nIn terms of stock recommendations, the consensus among eight brokerage firms rates GSK PLC (GSK, Financial) at an average recommendation of 2.9, categorizing it as a \"Hold.\" The recommendation scale where the lowest rating of 1 signifies a \"Strong Buy\" and 5 indicates a \"Sell,\" provides a nuanced guide for investors.\nFurther value is gleaned from GuruFocus' analysis, which estimates the one-year GF Value for GSK PLC (GSK, Financial) at $42.31. This reflects a projected upside of 12.41% from the current market price of $37.64. The GF Value represents GuruFocus' approach to determining a stock's fair trading value, integrating historical trading multiples, past business growth, and future business performance projections.

    "text": "Mulheres marcham contra alta de feminicídios em Honduras Vestidas de preto em sinal de luto, cerca de 300 mulheres marcharam nesta quinta-feira (25) em Tegucigalpa, a capital de Honduras, até o Congresso Nacional, no Dia da Mulher Hondurenha, em protesto contra o aumento dos feminicídios no país. \"Viemos exigir que a vida das mulheres hondurenhas seja respeitada, por isso viemos a este Congresso Nacional\", disse no megafone uma ativista que cobria seu rosto e cabelo com lenços pretos. A polícia colocou barreiras ao redor do Congresso, onde se iniciava uma nova legislatura com a participação da presidente Xiomara Castro, mas as manifestantes conseguiram superá-las e chegaram à parte baixa do edifício. \"Estamos marchando hoje contra toda a violência, desde a do lar até a feminicida. Exigimos a aprovação da Lei Integral Contra a Violência, prometida pela presidente. Não podemos esperar\", declarou à AFP a manifestante Sandra Deras. Segundo o Centro de Direitos das Mulheres, a violência contra a mulher vem crescendo em Honduras. Nos primeiros 15 dias de 2024, ao menos 15 mulheres foram assassinadas. O Observatório da Violência da Universidade Nacional Autônoma de Honduras aponta que, em 2023, foram registrados 380 feminicídios, enquanto em 2022 foram 308. De acordo com a ONU Mulheres, Honduras é o quinto país com a maior taxa de feminicídios do mundo, 6,47 para cada 100.000 habitantes, o que o coloca como o mais perigoso da América Latina para a mulher. str-fj/gm/ic/rpr © Agence France-Presse ID: {{comments.info.id}} URL: [{{comments.info.url}}] Ocorreu um erro ao carregar os comentários.

    "text": "ATLANTA — The Falcons will forfeit a fifth-round pick in the 2025 NFL draft and were fined $300,000 for violating the league’s Anti-Tampering Policy following a three month-long investigation, the NFL announced Thursday.\n“This penalty was a little light given the last time I remember tampering during the 48-hour free agency period was the Chiefs and Jeremy Maclin,” said Joel Corry, CBS Sports business analyst. “The facts line up, and the (Chiefs) got docked a third-round pick and a sixth-round pick.”\nThe Falcons may have benefitted from cooperating with the league.\n“I’m going to make the assumption that they found Kansas City’s conduct more egregious than Atlanta’s,” said Corry, an Emory graduate. “Some people were expecting much harsher penalties. But the Falcons are only giving up a Day Three pick. That’s more of a slap on the wrist.”\nThe investigation was related to contact with free agents — quarterback Kirk Cousins, wide receiver Darnell Mooney and tight end Charlie Woerner — during the two-day negotiating period before the start of the 2024 league year.\nIn addition, the Falcons were fined $250,000, and general manager Terry Fontenot was fined $50,000.\nFalcons owner Arthur Blank, president Greg Beadles and Fontenot were “unavailable” to comment on the matter, according to a team spokesperson.\nThis was the second time in six months that the Falcons were cited for a rules violation by the league office.\nIn December, the NFL fined the Falcons $75,000 and then-coach Arthur Smith $25,000 for violating the NFL injury-reporting policy before the club’s Week 7 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. After going 7-10 for the third consecutive season, Smith was terminated after the season.\nIn its announcement of the penalties, the NFL said that regarding the improper contact the “club acknowledges took place with regard to these three players.”\nWhile no official from the team was available for comment, the Falcons issued the following statement on the penalties.\n“We are pleased this review is complete. We cooperated fully with the league and its review, and appreciate the NFL’s thoroughness. As we do with every process, we will review how we operate and look for ways to improve.”\nThe Falcons signed Cousins to a four-year contract worth up to $180 million March 13. The NFL reviewed the signing for possible tampering violations.\nIn his introductory press conference, Cousins indicated that he had met with the Falcons’ training staff and public relations staff the previous day, both of which would have been violations of tampering as such discussions came before he signed.\nCousins also discussed talking with team executive Ryan Pace and then admitted to helping to recruit Mooney from the Bears. The Vikings did not file a complaint against the Falcons.\nIn the announcement of the penalties, the NFL wrote: “While the policy permits clubs to engage with and negotiate all aspects of an NFL player contract with the certified agent of any prospective unrestricted free agent during the two-day negotiating period, any direct contact between the player and an employee or representative of the club is prohibited. This includes discussion of travel arrangements or other logistical matters, which the club acknowledges took place with regard to these three players.”\nIn his first comments to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution since the signing of Cousins in April, Blank denied that the team tampered in violation of league rules.\n“The tampering deal, we obviously don’t believe we tampered,” Blank said at the league meetings in Orlando, Fla. “We shared all of the information with the league. They’ll review the process and the facts. They are in the middle of doing that. Whatever the result is, we’ll deal with it.”\nThe Philadelphia Eagles, who also were being investigated by the league office, will not face punishment related to their signing of running back Saquon Barkley on March 11, the NFL announced Thursday.\nTampering violations are considered serious by the league. For tampering with free-agent wide receiver Maclin, the Chiefs were stripped of their third-round pick in 2016, their sixth-round pick in 2017 and fined $250,000. Chiefs coach Andy Reid was fined $50,000 and then-general manager John Dorsey was fined $25,000.\nThe Chiefs were cited for “improper contact” before the start of free agency.\nWoerner’s agent was reached, but he had “no comment” on the matter.\nThe agents for Cousins and Mooney did not immediately respond to interview requests.\n©2024 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
