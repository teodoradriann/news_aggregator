    "title": "Tarot Cards Nearly Destroyed Her Life | CBN",
    "text": "\"I really believe I opened a lot of spiritual doorways and that's when the torment began,” Laura Danley said about her life after delving into the occult. “I started seeing things. There were whispers all around me all the time. It was all downhill from there.” Laura grew up with Christian parents, going to church and praying to Jesus. But the love she had for God turned into resentment after she was diagnosed with a life-threatening heart condition at fifteen.\n“They said that my aortic root was double the size it was supposed to be,” Laura said. “All I heard was, ‘Your life just got a lot shorter and you can never run again.’ I was running track and cross country before that happened. I felt betrayed by God because I thought I'd been a good kid. I remember silently yelling, ‘I don't want you part of my life anymore. I will get through this on my own.’”\nShe began ditching classes and continued to run in secret. Then one evening after rehearsing for a school play, Laura was assaulted by a group of boys. She broke free and escaped, but the experience left her traumatized and filled with shame. Laura started looking for anything that would give her a sense of control over her life, so she bought a book on how to read palms. “People would just flock to me,” Laura said. “It was forbidden and I wanted power. I wanted to try everything. So, at first it seemed innocent enough.”\nAt seventeen she went to a cardiologist who told her she had been misdiagnosed and that she was actually healthy. The good news only emboldened Laura to continue on with her journey into the occult. She then joined the Air Force at age 20 to become a pilot. One of her fellow cadets was a Wiccan, and he encouraged her to try a Ouija board. After buying one from a local toy store, she brought it back to the base where she began speaking with a spirit claiming to be a Civil War soldier.\n“And it wasn't long after that, mentally, I really started going downhill,” Laura said. “I couldn’t think straight. I started having flashbacks to the assault in high school. Emotionally I was just not stable anymore. I knew that I should not be flying, so I ended up getting out. It was devastating, it really was. I worked really hard for my wings.”\nLaura put away the Ouija board, though still went on to adopt the Wiccan religion. After moving to Roswell, New Mexico, to attend aviation maintenance school, she met another Wiccan at a party who taught her how to read Tarot cards. The power of divination was enthralling for Laura – however it came with a price.\n“I remember trying to get to know my Tarot deck one night and I was supposed to sleep with it underneath my pillow,” Laura said. “I woke up slammed, like I had been attacked. I was covered in these scratches, even on places on my back that I couldn't reach. It got so bad that I was afraid of the dark. I think I had given demonic entities an opportunity to mess with me and that's what they were doing.”\nThis went on for the next three years. Eventually Laura married and had a daughter, Hailey. Although she loved her daughter, paranoia and depression were consuming Laura’s life and she felt her family would be better off without her. So, she planned to disappear after taking Hailey to her next health checkup. But, at the pediatrician’s office, a nurse came over and put her hand on Laura. What she did next changed everything.\n“She said, ‘I want to pray for you.’ I was so desperate at that point I said, ‘fine whatever.’ She stayed in that office, I believe for an hour and a half, praying over me,” Laura recalled. \"I thought, ‘I don’t know what’s going on, but okay.’ All I know is that when I left that doctor’s office I was walking across the parking lot and I had my daughter, Hailey, in her infant carrier, and I looked down at her and I said, ‘You know what? I may not be the best mother, but I'm your mother and I'm not going anywhere.’ I looked at the sky and I said, ‘If You're out there then show me, I need to know.’ When I got home, I saw those stacks of books, and the Tarot cards, and the candles and everything, and I realized, ‘All this is nuts.’ I just didn't want it around me anymore.”\nShe then went to her mother-in-law, a Christian, for guidance. She took Laura to church where a pastor answered the questions about God and the spiritual realm she had. Returning to her vehicle, Laura paused. “I just bowed over and started praying, and crying, and telling God, ‘I have been so wrong, I tried to do all of this by myself for so long. I thought I was so strong.’ I prayed and asked Jesus to take control of my life,” Laura said. \"I felt clean. I felt like there was some serious change that happened all of a sudden. Looking back, I realize that all those doors that I had opened to the spiritual realm, I believe in that moment God was like, ‘Okay, let's close those now.’”\nThe same passion Laura once had for learning about the occult, she then put toward reading the Bible, praying and going to church. She also went to counseling, working through the traumas of her youth. It’s been eighteen years since Laura gave her life to Christ and the nightmares that haunted her stopped.\n“How grateful I am for what He's done, words cannot define it,” Laura said. “Not only did He rescue my daughter from a completely different life, but He rescued my marriage. We have another child now. My home is so free of that spiritual oppression. I want to talk to people about this. I want them to know that if they've seen things in the occult or they've been exposed to it, and they're frightened, and they don't know who to talk to, I want to tell them that there is hope. We’ve got to give it to Jesus and let Him heal us.”\nShare Your Story\nShare This article",

    "text": "Canadian 3rd grader shows support for volunteer firefighters with art CANADIAN, Texas (KFDA) - Hemphill County was just one of the many affected by the fires sweeping through the Panhandle. The Canadian Volunteer Fire Department chief is highlighting the outpouring of support. “Got letters from schools from all over, you know, third grade classes sending letters and things and its just been a, you know, I hate to say we have to meet this way, but you know the outpouring has been great,” said Fire Chief Scott Brewster. One third grader, Marley Sanchez, wanted to show her love and support by drawing her community firefighters saving Aud, the famous Canadian dinosaur. “I drew a poster that says, ‘I love you Canadian.’ I draw a fireman setting the fires down and I’m supporting them,” said Sanchez, a student at Baker Elementary School. The fires burned 112 homes in Hemphill County, and Sanchez says she wants the firefighters to know she loves and appreciates them helping her family. “We start early and, you know, the kids are our future, they look up to you. You go around town and they go, ‘You’re that fireman aren’t you?’ and they go, ‘Yeah.’ And you know, it makes you feel good, and just even know the little ones are thinking as well in these times,” said Brewster. The Canadian third grade student had one more thing to say to the Canadian volunteer firefighters. “I appreciate for them and I support them,” said Sanchez. Copyright 2024 KFDA.

    "text": "(RTTNews) - Supernus Pharmaceuticals Inc. (SUPN) announced a promising data from its exploratory open-label Phase 2a clinical study of SPN-820 in adults with major depressive disorder. The study examined the safety and tolerability of SPN-820 2400 mg given once every 3 days as an adjunctive treatment to the current baseline antidepressant therapy, as well as assessed the rapid onset of improvement in depressive symptoms. The analysis is based on 40 enrolled subjects, of which 38 completed the 10-day treatment period. The data indicate a clinically meaningful improvement in depression scores, with a reduction of -6.1 at two hours and -9.6 at Day 10 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-6 Items (HAM-D6). Similarly, the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) showed a notable decrease of -16.6 at four hours and -22.9 at Day 10. Additionally, suicidal ideation decreased by 80%, with the percentage of individuals reporting suicidal thoughts dropping from 12.5% at baseline to 2.6% by Day 10. SPN-820 was well-tolerated, exhibiting a low discontinuation rate of 2.5% due to adverse events (AEs). The most commonly reported adverse events related to the drug included headache, nausea, somnolence, and dizziness, while other adverse events observed included cognitive disorder, dry mouth, fatigue, nasal decongestion, and oral paresthesia.",

    "text": "La\n Catedral de Zamora atesora un rico patrimonio artístico centrado en el nacimiento de Jesús. Son esculturas, pinturas, relieves e incluso hay un cobre según repasó el doctor en Historia del Arte y canónigo de la seo, Heras, la tarde del viernes en la charla sobre iconografía navideña del primer templo diocesano.\nDe entre las joyas existentes, el experto puso en valor el retablo de la Majestad realizado en el último cuarto del siglo XVI y atribuido a Juan de Falcote. En su centro se encuentran los relieves de la Epifanía, el nacimiento y el anuncio a los pastores. \"Los tres son muy bellos, pero llama la atención el nacimiento\".\nEn la extraordinaria capilla de San Ildefonso o del cardenal en sendas hornacinas se ubican dos grupos escultóricos tallados por Juan de Montejo el Viejo y policromados por Alonso de Escobar en 1598. En uno de ellos se representa el nacimiento de Jesús con la escena de la adoración del niño por María, José, los ángeles y los pastores. En esta pieza llama la atención el colorido del conjunto que \"solo se ha limpiado, no ha se intervenido\", remarca el experto en patrimonio. De esta obra subraya \"la calidad de las figuras del Misterio, San José, María y del niño\". Además, en su opinión, \"es de lo mejor que ha hecho Juan de Montejo. Es maravilloso\", recalca.\nOtro de los ejemplos artísticamente reseñable se localiza en la capilla de San Bernardo, donde está al culto la imagen del\nCristo de las Injurias. A la mano izquierda del crucificado se localiza un retablo mandado hacer por Francisco de Valencia y efectuado antes de 1606, fecha en el que lo policromó y doró Pedro de Quirós. La parte central presenta motivos de la vida María y en la parte superior \"tiene otros tres relieves que representan las escenas de la anunciación, la adoración de los pastores y la Epifanía\", según figura en la publicación \"Catedral de Zamora. Perla del siglo XII\".\nEn la capilla de San Juan Evangelista en el excepcional sepulcro del doctor Grado, bajo la cama, puede observarse una Virgen entronizada con el niño sobre ella, en tanto que en el oratorio de San Miguel en su actual retablo, que procede de la parroquia de San Juan de Puerta Nueva y lo efectuó Juan de Montejo el Viejo, aparece la talla de la Virgen con el Niño o Nuestra Señora de la Piedad.\nEn la capilla de Santiago, que alberga elementos pétreos, el visitante del\nMuseo Catedralicio puede descubrir a la Virgen con el Niño y San Juanito, labrado en mármol blanco de Carrara hacia 1520 por Bartolomé Ordóñez, quien está considerado como uno de los mejores escultores del Renacimiento español.\nLa pieza procede del desaparecido monasterio de San Jerónimo de Zamora y entre sus particularidades está que la Virgen, de pie, sostiene al Niño (desnudo y portando una rama de cerezas) en su brazo izquierdo. Junto al costado derecho de la Virgen se coloca la figura de San Juanito, caminando y llevando en sus manos un pajarito, sujeto por el Niño Jesús con un cordel rojo, parcialmente roto. En la base, aparece la cabeza de un querubín alado con gesto sonriente para señalar la divinidad de los personajes representados.\nLa Catedral, a mayores, cuenta con más de media docena de lienzos donde se inmortalizan pasajes bíblicos vinculados con la natividad realizados entre el siglo XVII y el XVIII. En este conjunto aparece una temática no muy frecuente la Virgen lactante, un óleo sobre lienzo de autor desconocido o un único óleo sobre cobre de la Epifanía de autor desconocido de la segunda mitad del XVIII.\nEn la Puerta del Obispo puede contemplarse un relieve de la Virgen María con el niño entre ángeles.\nEn él la madre aparece con \"porte mayestático, vestida con túnica. Está sentada en un trono de patas torneadas y cubierta por un baldaquino rematado con motivos arquitectónicos\". Sobre su rodilla sostiene al niño, bendiciendo, describe Rivera de las Heras en \"La Catedral de Zamora\".",

    "title": "MÉDICO ANTIENVEJECIMIENTO | Ángel Durántez, experto en longevidad: \"A partir de los 35 años todos empezamos a estar pre-enfermos\"",
    "text": "El doctor Ángel Durántez Prados (1963) es pionero en España de la medicina preventiva. Titulado en Age Management Medicine (medicina para el envejecimiento saludable) en Estados Unidos , en su larga trayectoria profesional ha asistido a un cambio fundamental : ya no solo queremos aparentar ser jóvenes , también estar bien y funcionales durante más tiempo, porque vivimos mucho más. Sostiene el experto que, nos guste o no admitirlo, todos comenzamos a estar pre-enfermos a partir de los 35 años, que es cuando empiezan a gestarse las dolencias que nos traerá la vejez . La clave: empezar a cuidarse, cuanto antes, mejor. Durántez ejerce, desde 1988, en el ámbito privado como médico de centros, equipos, federaciones y de numerosos deportistas de todos los niveles y categorías. Autor del libro Joven a los 100, todas las claves para vivir más y mejor (La Esfera de los Libros), desde 2017 dirige su propia clínica en Madrid , defiende la importancia de mantener estilos saludables de vida, hacer ejercicio, nutrirse bien, descansar, dormir o la vigilancia regular de los biomarcadores.\n¿Cuándo nace el concepto de medicina antiaging ? Primero surge la idea de un antienvejecimiento cosmético, que era: 'Oye, vamos a ver cómo aparentamos ser más jóvenes'. Coge mucha potencia la medicina estética y la cirugía estética. Hablamos de los 90. Luego, muchas especialidades -cardiología, endocrinología, oncología, neurología, ginecología... - empiezan a plantearse si se puede hacer algo más que curar cuando ya se está enfermo. Surge ese movimiento que se distancia de la palabra anti-envejecimiento para hablar de medicina preventiva. Se abren las primeras clínicas específicas, siempre en Estados Unidos, en torno al 2005.\nEn las marcas de envejecimiento ya se está empezando a hablar de cómo contribuye la soledad Doctor Durántez\n¿En España, cuándo se empieza a prestar atención al envejecimiento saludable? . En 2013 ocurre una cosa muy interesante. Varios investigadores describen en la revista Cell las claves del envejecimiento de un organismo. Firman aquel trabajo, entre otros, el doctor español Carlos López-Otín. Es un artículo mítico que cambia todo el panorama. En el 2023, volvieron a actualizar estas marcas (de envejecimiento) y ya están hablando de las siguientes, por ejemplo cómo contribuye la soledad. No es una marca molecular propiamente dicha, pero preocupa el aislamiento social y lo que va a venir con todo esto.\n¿Es posible prevenir las enfermedades? A partir de los 35 o 40 años, empezamos a estar pre-enfermos. Significa que todas esas enfermedades relacionadas con el proceso de envejecimiento, crónicas no transmisibles, las vamos cogiendo. Unos van hacia la cardiovascular antes, otros hacia la diabetes, otros al deterioro neurocognitivo, al cáncer... dependiendo de nuestra genética. Se hablaba de que esto tenía que ver con la teoría de la senescencia programada (en biología, un proceso natural por el cual las células envejecen y dejan de dividirse, pero no mueren). De alguna manera estamos programados para empezar a desaparecer cuando ya hemos cumplido con nuestro ciclo vital.\n¿Cuándo debemos empezar a cuidarnos? A los 44 años, concretamente, hay un aumento de la velocidad del envejecimiento. Puedes empezar cuando quieras. Dices: 'Bueno, fumo, bebo, me drogo a tope porque soy joven y ya cuando tenga 50, empiezo'. Probablemente, vas a llegar mal. Así que cada cual decida qué quiere hacer con su salud. ¿A partir de qué momento sería el más lógico?. A partir de los 40. En nuestras clínicas, la mayoría de la gente que viene es con 40 largos o 50. Pero, claro, en la década de los 50, lo que vamos a encontrar es más que si hubieras venido a los 40.\nLa cantidad de hierro que puede tener un determinado alimento de ahora es mucho más baja de la que tenía hace 50 o 60 años Doctor Durántez\n¿Empezar a cuidarse pronto garantiza un buen envejecimiento? Solo con una alimentación sana, equilibrada, es difícil colocar los biomarcadores en sus niveles óptimos. Es muy difícil tener un nivel óptimo de vitamina D tomando el sol. Además, te estás jugando un melanoma. Es muy difícil conseguir unos niveles de índice omega 3 solo con la alimentación. Sí, es posible si vives en Noruega y cenas salmón. Pero eso no ocurre aquí. Incluso haciendo una dieta mediterránea perfecta, al final difícilmente vamos a alcanzar esos valores. Entre otras cosas porque la densidad nutricional de los alimentos ha disminuido enormemente en el último siglo por la forma de cultivo. La cantidad de hierro que puede tener un determinado alimento de ahora es mucho más baja de la que tenía hace 50 o 60 años.\n¿Qué hacemos entonces? . Apoyarnos en el complemento nutricional. Con sentido. La suplementación, sí tiene un efecto que puede actuar en, por ejemplo, bajar los niveles de colesterol o subir esos niveles de vitamina D. Y eso es lo que justifica ese pilar de la complementación nutricional en el proceso de ese envejecimiento saludable.\nPero, cuidarse, a veces, sale caro. Tiene que ver más con la mentalidad que con el coste. Somos conscientes de que acceder a este tipo de cuidados no es barato. En casa puedes comer arroz blanco y patata y la cesta de la compra, todos los días, va a ser más barata que si compras pescado. Sabemos también que hay estudios que dicen que las clases más deprimidas se enferman más y viven menos.\nHa aumentado la esperanza de vida 30 años en un siglo y, de esos, hay al menos 15 en los que no se está muy bien Doctor Durántez\nVivimos cada vez más años. Pero, ¿vivimos bien? . Ha aumentado la esperanza de vida 30 años en un siglo y, de esos, hay al menos 15 en los que no se está muy bien. Además, las mujeres tenéis un 25% más de vida con mala salud que los hombres. En parte porque nosotros nos morimos antes, pero también lo que vivís vosotras de más, lo vivís peor. Y aquí podríamos entrar en debates de las causas, que son muchas.\n¿Qué hay de la genética? No pesa más del 10% en el resultado final de tu longevidad. Para la mayoría de la población. Quienes viven 100 años o más sí tienen genética protectora. Pesa, pero no tanto como nos creemos. Es una forma de exculparnos, de no querer hacer las cosas como tenemos que hacerlo. Además, esas personas centenarias, cuidaban mucho la alimentación, pese a lo básica que era. No existían alimentos procesados y ultraprocesados. Era el secreto.",

Defence Navy unveils new Shivaji-inspired epaulettes for admirals, says it’s ‘freedom from colonial mentality’ The change in design of epaulettes for senior Navy officers was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during Navy Day celebrations in Sindhudurg earlier this month. Smruti Deshpande 29 December, 2023 06:15 pm IST Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Linkedin Navy personnel taking part in dress rehearsal ahead of this month's Navy Day celebrations Sunday | Representational image | ANI Text Size: A- A+\nNew Delhi: In the coming year, Indian Navy officers from the top three ranks — admiral, vice admiral and rear admiral — will get new epaulettes for their uniforms, as part of the Navy’s plans to move away from the “shackles of colonialism”.\nIn a post on the social media platform X (previously Twitter) Friday, the Navy unveiled the design of the new epaulettes, detailing the changes that are being made.\nThe change in the design of the epaulettes for senior Navy officers was earlier announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during Navy Day celebrations in Sindhudurg, Maharashtra, this month.\nShow Full Article\nWhile the current epaulettes —bearing the Nelson Ring, a golden ring in remembrance of Lord Nelson — have been in use since the colonial era, the new design is inspired by Shivaji’s royal seal, which was used for official purposes in the Maratha kingdom.\nThe “Indian Navy proudly unveils the new design of admirals’ epaulettes. Announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during Navy Day 2023 at Sindhudurg, the new design is drawn from the naval ensign & inspired by rajmudra of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, and is a true reflection of our rich maritime heritage,” said the Navy on X.\nIt added that the adoption of the new design reaffirms the Navy’s commitment to the two pillars of Panch Pran (five vows) — virasat par garv and ghulami ki mansikta se mukti , which roughly translate to being proud of one’s traditions and freedom from the shackles of colonial mentality.\nAlso read: Rafale jets for Indian Navy: France sends in bid, contract likely to be inked only after 2024 polls\nElements of the epaulette\nGiving details of the elements included in the new epaulette design, the Navy said that the the rajmudra -inspired octagon “represents the eight cardinal directions, indicative of an all-around long-term vision”.\nFurther, the golden Navy button “reiterates its resolve to do away with ghulami ki maansikta ”, it said.\nThe Indian sword on the epaulette emphasises the “very essence of our raison d’etre”, which is “cutting edge of national power and win wars through dominance, defeating adversaries and overcoming every challenge”, said the Navy’s post.\nIt added that the telescope symbolises a long-term vision, foresight and a weather-eye in an ever-changing world.\nIn the new epaulette design, the base on which the Ashoka capital (the national emblem) is placed will now be a shape of the octagon. Earlier, the Ashoka capital was placed on a crown-shaped red patch.\nThe new design shows that the shape of the stars — which indicate the rank of the officer — will also undergo changes.\nIn 2022, the Indian Navy unveiled a new naval ensign, which carried the St George’s Cross. The earlier ensign was a white flag with the cross. At the intersection of the cross was the national emblem with the tricolour placed on the top-left canton.\nThis year, the Indian Navy also did away with the practice of holding the colonial-era baton. A ceremonial baton is now placed appropriately in the office of the head of the organisation of every unit. The ceremonial handover of the baton is now undertaken within the office as part of a change of command.\nAt the Sindhudurg event, the Prime Minister had announced that taking inspiration from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, India is marching ahead today by leaving behind the mentality of slavery. “I am happy that the epaulettes worn by our naval officers will now showcase markers of the heritage and legacy of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj,” he said.\n(Edited by Poulomi Banerjee)",

    "title": "消防引入電動車滅火救援工具　籲切勿嘗試自行撲滅電動車火警 - 新浪香港",
    "text": "消防處表示，去年發生48宗涉及電動車的交通意外及火警，較前年增加92%。處方指出，電動車一旦起火，鋰電池在高溫下可能會導致「熱失控」，火勢急速蔓延，甚至有爆炸風險，消防處各分區已引入電動車滅火救援工具，呼籲駕駛者切勿嘗試自行撲滅電動車火警。\n消防處災難應變救援隊助理消防區長文家平表示，灌救電動車火警較傳統汽油車複雜，因為鋰電池一般安裝在車底，有堅固外殼包圍，如果單靠傳統方法在外圍射水，只能間接滅火，成效較低。根據國際研究，有機會要花4小時救援，以及用接近15萬公升水才可冷卻電池。\n針對電動車意外增加，消防處添置相關工具包括電動車應急插頭、電動車滅火氈和電池滅火系統等。從訓練及近期行動統計，消防人員只需平均用2小時和大約1萬5千公升水已可令鋰電池穩定。\n文家平呼籲，駕駛者若發現車輛電池系統發出警示信號，或車輛產生異常氣味或煙霧，應立即停車及撤離車輛，視乎當時情況聯絡維修人員或報警，等待消防人員到場處理，即使附近有水源也不建議自行救火，因為鋰電池著火釋出的氣體和火焰可以十分危險。",
