    "title": "Se cae el mito del agua: no hay que beber dos litros diarios, según un estudio",
    "text": "Siempre hemos escuchado que se recomienda beber dos litros de agua al día, algo que ha sido debatido durante muchos años. Para generar aún más dudas, un estudio publicado en la revista Science ha cuestionado esta premisa. La investigación invita a que la cantidad de agua que habría que beber al día sería menor para la mayoría de personas, siendo una cantidad excesiva porque la cantidad de agua que necesita cada cuerpo depende de condiciones físicas, ambientales y genéticas y de factores como el clima, la actividad física y la dieta. La mitad del agua que se necesita se obtienen de los alimentos. Una dieta equilibrada en frutas, verduras, pescados y carbohidratos como pasta y arroz puede sustituir parte del agua que se necesita. Una persona con actividad física moderada y sin patologías, los investigadores recomiendan que beber entre 1,5 y 1,8 litros es suficiente para estar hidratados. Hay algunos grupos de personas que necesitan más cantidad de agua como los recién nacidos, que por su crecimiento y metabolismo requieren más hidratación. Los deportistas con una actividad física intensa y las mujeres embarazadas, son otros de los grupos que tienen que tomar más agua. Los litros de agua que hay que beber también varían entre hombres y mujeres, con una diferencia de medio litro entre ambos géneros. Según el estudio, la humedad influye en la hidratación. Si la humedad ambiental supera el 50%, las necesidades de agua aumentan 0,3 litros. Y si se duplica, la cantidad de agua se incrementa en un litro más. Este estudio refleja que las necesidades de beber agua dependen de cada persona y que son variables. Por lo que la recomendación de beber dos litros no hay que llevarla a rajatabla.",

R F San Lorenzo de Almagro is in trouble and all because of the Colombian midfielder Yeison Gordillowho had not received payments when he played for the Argentine club and FIFA had to resolve the situation. The Colombian midfielder was bought by the club at the beginning of the 2021 season and arrived after they paid 1.2 million dollars for 80 percent of his transfer, but then the player claimed that they had not been bad in some payments, so who ended up canceling his contract and looking for a team. After two years of that incident with Gordillo, FIFA took action on the matter and decided that San Lorenzo is disqualified from making incorporations, but must also pay the Colombian the debt that is equivalent to one and a half million dollars, plus interest for the Blackberry. After leaving San Lorenzo, Yeison Gordillo had to return to Colombia and was Junior from Barranquilla who received him after that incident with the Almagro team, but later, he managed to return to Argentine soccer to play in Union and Vélez Sarsfieldteam where he currently plays. Gordillo played a total of 34 games in San Lorenzo during 2021 and 2022, also managing to score a total of two goals with that institution.

    "title": "UK to spend GBP22 bil on carbon capture sites as costs rise",
    "text": "The UK recommitted to a major investment in carbon-saving technology even as rising costs mean it will only be possible to capture a fraction of the emissions released from industrial sites compared to previous estimates.\nThe government said it will spend as much asGBP21.7 billion ($36.94 billion) over 25 years to capture and store CO2 emissions from two industrial areas in Britain. It delivers on a promise made by the previous Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt last year, but pledges funding for just three of the eight projects shortlisted for the program after supply chain costs rose sharply in recent years.\n“Today’s announcement will give industry the certainty it needs – committing to 25 years of funding in this groundbreaking technology – to help deliver jobs, kick start growth, and repair this country once and for all,” Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a statement.\nCarbon capture will be an essential technology to achieve the government’s goal of having a clean grid by 2030. The technology can also be used to cut emissions from heavy industries, such as cement or fertiliser production.\nIn July, the National Audit Office (NAO) warned about the UK’s reliance on CCS to reach its net-zero goals as potential costs escalate. Previous failures to develop carbon capture over the past two decades in Britain mean the technology remains relatively untested.\nThe plan is to develop clusters that would allow various emitters to share pipelines that transport emissions and storage sites. The first two areas in Track 1 are the East Coast Cluster, including projects from BP and Equinor, in the east of England and HyNet that would serve sites in the west of England and Wales.\nLearn More\nSee also: Global banks want to monetise biodiversity\nAlong with GBP8 billion of private investment, the carbon capture plans will directly create 4,000 jobs, according to a government statement.\nThe funding from the government will be enough to build the transport and storage networks for both clusters, as well as capture technology at three emitting sites.\nThose projects will remove 3 million tons of CO2 per year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg . That would fall far short of a previous government target to capture and store between 20 million to 30 million tons of CO2 per year by the end of the decade.\nSee also: Role of LNG, low-carbon electricity imports set to feature at SIEW 2024\nIf those are the only projects supported by this funding, it would represent a cost of about GBP300 per tonne of CO2, roughly eight times the current UK carbon price. The decision follows reporting by Bloomberg earlier this year that the government was considering delaying some CCS projects due to rising costs.\nWhile company executives from the projects hailed the announcement, there’s no clear indication when the final investment decisions will happen.\nThe projects are already behind schedule. Investment decisions were originally planned to be made by the end of last year, a target that was then delayed to at least September, according to a report by the NAO. If the deadline slips further, tentative contracts could need to be renegotiated with suppliers at an even higher cost.\n“Slower progress with getting Track-1 up and running means that DESNZ will struggle to achieve its 2030 ambitions for carbon capture,” the NAO warned in a report in July.\nWithin the clusters, the previous government identified eight projects in March last year that it deemed ready to proceed to negotiations on the carbon capture business model that would underpin final investment decisions. The UK has been negotiating with each project on the level of subsidy required. In each case it will be paid out for each metric tonne of CO2 captured, according to planning documents.\nThe funding allocated by the government will help realise three of the sites. Those include a power plant under development by BP and Equinor, an energy to waste plant and a project that will create hydrogen from natural gas.",

Por Deutsche Welle\n26/09/2024 • 17:20 • Atualizado em 26/09/2024 • 17:20 A primeira sessão do recém-eleito Parlamento regional do estado da Turíngia, no leste da Alemanha, teve que ser interrompida nesta quinta-feira (26/09), devendo ser retomada no sábado após confusão envolvendo a legenda de ultradireita Alternativa para a Alemanha (AfD) e os outros partidos da câmara regional.\nFoi a primeira reunião parlamentar após as eleições de 1º de setembro, em que a AfD obteve ganhos históricos, conquistando mais de um terço dos assentos e terminando em um claro primeiro lugar.\nPor ter sido a legenda com mais votos nas eleições, a AfD tinha o direito de apresentar um candidato à presidência do Parlamento regional da Turíngia.\nNo entanto, os outros partidos anunciaram que não votariam em nenhum candidato da sigla, endossando assim o cordão sanitário em torno do grupo.\nOs conservadores da União Democrata Cristã (CDU) e os populistas da Aliança Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) queriam apresentar uma proposta de alteração das regras de procedimento para permitir que os outros partidos apresentassem candidatos em uma primeira votação.\nDe acordo com as atuais regras de procedimento, eles teriam que esperar até que o candidato da AfD não obtivesse a maioria nas duas primeiras votações.\nJürgen Treutler, membro da AfD, foi indicado para presidir a sessão devido à sua idade e impediu que a proposta fosse colocada em votação.\nTreutler argumentou que as regras de procedimento do Parlamento só poderiam ser alteradas após a eleição de um presidente.\nSessão foi interropida seis vezes A disputa fez com que a sessão fosse interrompida até seis vezes e, no final, o gerente parlamentar da bancada da CDU, Andreas Bühl, anunciou que levaria o caso ao Tribunal Constitucional da Turíngia, alegando que Treutler havia violado os direitos dos deputados com seu comportamento.\nDurante a sessão, houve discussões acaloradas entre Treutler e Bühl, que chegou a acusar o deputado da AfD de perpetrar uma \"machtergreifung\", expressão frequentemente usada para definir a tomada do poder pelos nazistas em 1933.\nA AfD obteve 32,8% dos votos nas eleições de 1º de setembro, o que lhe deu 32 das 88 cadeiras, e apresentou como candidata a presidente do parlamento Wiebke Muhsal, que foi condenada a pagar uma multa em um caso de fraude na última legislatura.\nA CDU, com 23 cadeiras, é o segundo maior partido no Parlamento da Turíngia e pretende apresentar Thadäus König, um parlamentar que tem o apoio de outros partidos além do AfD.\nA Turíngia é o primeiro estado federal alemão em que o AfD se tornou a principal força parlamentar.\nA CDU quer eleger seu líder regional Mario Voigt como governador. Para isso, está considerando a formação de uma coalizão tripartite incluindo o BSW e o Partido Social-Democrata (SPD).\nEssa aliança, no entanto, teria apenas 44 assentos, o que também exigiria o apoio dos socialistas do A Esquerda.\nmd (EFE, DPA)\nVeja também\nCaso Felipe Melo: Kauã Elias diz que não estava no momento da suposta intimidação a jovem\nPolícia apreende McLaren avaliada em R$ 3 milhões que pertence à Deolane Bezerra\nAdolescente morre em piscina de parque no RJ; família diz que cabelo foi sugado por ralo Tópicos relacionados Notícias",

    "title": "Challenges and Resilience: Kang SeolMin's Journey in Hello Trot",
    "text": "Kang SeolMin, a prominent trot singer, recently shared her challenges in the MBN documentary ‘Exclusive World,’ which aired on January 23. Known for her vibrant performances, Kang was the runner-up in the popular competition ‘Hello Trot’ from 2021 to 2022. Despite her fame, being a trot singer poses significant challenges.\nTo support herself, Kang has worked at an electronic waste collection company for the past year. She often wears worn work clothes, highlighting her struggles. In a conversation with fellow trot singer Yong-ho, she mentioned that the beginning of the year, especially January and February, is a slow period for events in the industry. This seasonal lull emphasizes the financial uncertainty that many artists face.\nReflecting on her journey since her runner-up finish, Kang acknowledged that while ‘Hello Trot’ helped her build her singing career, it did not drastically improve her living conditions. Currently, she rents a small room for about 300,000 won (approximately $250) per month. Living modestly, she often eats minimal food and wears clothing borrowed from other artists, showcasing the challenges performers often encounter.\nKang also shared that her living space lacks basic amenities, such as a full-length mirror. This forces her to squat to choose her outfits. Despite these difficulties, she was excited to finally land an event gig after a long dry spell. To save money, she did her own makeup and used a borrowed small car to reach the venue.\nUpon arrival, Kang faced another challenge: changing clothes in the parking lot due to the absence of a waiting room for emerging artists. This experience illustrates the often-overlooked hardships faced by aspiring performers in the entertainment industry. The glitz and glamour can mask a grueling reality.\nKang SeolMin’s story serves as a poignant reminder of the resilience required to pursue a career in the arts. Her journey reflects the continual struggle for recognition and stability amidst the challenges of the music business. Additionally, reality TV competitions like ‘Hello Trot’ can significantly impact artists’ careers, but they also come with their own set of challenges.\nAs Kang continues her journey, she hopes for better support systems for struggling musicians in the industry. Her experiences highlight the need for greater awareness of the realities that many artists face today. Through her story, we understand the importance of resilience in the face of adversity.",

    "text": "La Asociación Mexicana de Empresas de Capital Humano (Amech) apoyó la ampliación del permiso por paternidad remunerado en México, un elemento importante para el \\\"impulso del desarrollo profesional de las mujeres\\\" y de una sociedad \\\"más igualitaria\\\".En un comunicado, la organización respaldó que estas licencias pasen de los cinco días actuales a los 20, una medida que la Cámara de Diputados aprobó el pasado diciembre como una reforma de la Ley del Trabajo.\\\"Representa un avance significativo en materia de derechos laborales y equidad de género. Mejora la retención de talento en empresas al demostrar compromiso con la conciliación laboral\\\", destacó.Aseguró que permite a las mujeres \\\"contar con un mayor apoyo durante los primeros días de crianza\\\" e \\\"impacta positivamente en lo laboral y económico\\\".En opinión de la Amech, el crecimiento de la participación femenina entre 2005 y 2023, que aumentó cinco puntos porcentuales, \\\"ha sido mínimo\\\".Según la Encuesta Nacional de Ocupación y Empleo, el 76,1 % de los hombres estaban en el mercado laboral en el tercer trimestre de 2023 frente al 46,4 % de las mujeres.Sin embargo, el presidente mexicano, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, pidió a mediados de marzo aplazar hasta después de las elecciones del 2 de junio distintas discusiones en el Congreso de la Unión, también la que aprobaría de manera definitiva este aumento.Actualmente, la reforma se encuentra entre los temas pendientes en el Senado.De hecho, la organización reconoció la \\\"controversia\\\" que ha sobrevolado esta ampliación, concretamente por las reticencias expresadas por organismos públicos como el Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social o la Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público (SHCP), que pidieron reducir la propuesta a 10 días.La falta de definición de López Obrador sobre estos temas ha generado polémica, en especial porque ha respaldado otras iniciativas laborales, como el aumento del salario mínimo, reformas al sistema de pensiones y la eliminación del “outsourcing” o subcontratación.\\\"La ampliación del permiso por paternidad emerge como una necesidad urgente\\\", advirtió la Amech, que apremió al Estado y al empresariado a \\\"reconocer este derecho y a colaborar para su efectiva implementación\\\".",
