    "text": "Teddi Mellencamp Hopes To Be 'Cancer-Free' As She Shares Positive Update\nBy Chukwudi Onyewuchi on April 23, 2025 at 7:00 PM EDT\nTeddi Mellencamp is delighted to share some positive news amid her ongoing battle with cancer.\n\"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" alum has continuously kept her fans updated on her health journey since she was diagnosed with melanoma in 2022.\nMellencamp has experienced several setbacks in her cancer journey lately, including its progression to stage 4, but her latest update is positive and filled her fans with hope.\nTeddi Mellencamp's Tumors Shrink Significantly\nView this post on Instagram\nOn Wednesday, Mellencamp shared a video on Instagram, providing the latest update on her cancer journey. Thankfully, it was a positive one.\n\"I have really exciting news, everyone,\" she began. \"Honestly, the crying is already done, but I just finished with all my scans and my tumors have significantly shrunk, which doctors believe means that this all will work and that I will be back to myself and feeling good.\"\nThe television personality revealed that she still has two more sessions of immunotherapy, adding, \"And then hopefully, I am done, and I will be cancer-free.\"\nMellencamp continued, \"I'm going to keep a positive outlook because that's the way my doctor just spoke to me.\"\nShe said, \"He's like, 'You did this, you got this.'\" Mellencamp mimicked her doctor's voice, saying, '\"You got that Mellencamp blood, so you're good.'\"\nTeddi Mellencamp Thanks Her Supporters\nIn the post's caption, Mellencamp elaborated on what she said in the video, noting that it was \"One update I couldn't wait to share!\"\nShe continued, \"All tumors stage 4 (metastasized melanoma in my brain and lungs) shrunk or disappeared so I have 6ish more weeks of immunotherapy and doctors believe I will be healed if everything stays on course.\"\nMellencamp concluded by thanking those who supported her amid her health struggles.\nShe wrote, \"Thank you to everyone who has sent their love, prayers, and positivity.\"\nFriends And Fans Celebrate With Teddi Mellencamp\nMany of Mellencamp's friends and fans reacted to her latest update with delight and excitement.\nKyle Richards described it as the \"BEST DAY EVER!!!!!!\" and added that she was \"So grateful.\"\nTamra Judge, who co-hosts the \"Two Ts in a Pod\" podcast with Mellencamp, added, \"I can't stop crying tears of joy ... I love you.\"\n\"The Real Housewives of Miami\" star Marysol Patton also wrote, \"This is incredible news, I'm so happy!! It was my therapeutic playlist.\"\nA fan wrote, \"What a wonderful report, Teddi! This truly made my day I think of you all the time.\"\nAnother fan added, \"Teddi I am screaming in happiness LOVE YOU! Your strength and positive mental attitude is everything.\"\nMellencamp Gets Emotional As She Shares Pain She Deals With\nThe positive update follows a few days after Teddi Mellencamp spoke to Entertainment Tonight's Nischelle Turner about her battle with stage 4 cancer.\nDuring the interview, she narrated her journey since she was diagnosed with melanoma and revealed how the disease had affected her relationship with her kids.\nMellencamp said, \"I don't think you can understand like the debilitating pain that I feel some days thinking about the fact that, like my kids, you know.\"\nShe fought the tears as she spoke, adding, \"You know, like that is extremely frightening. Like my kids are young. I mean, I remember one day in the hospital, I was like, 'I feel like today might be Dove's birthday,' and Edwin [Arroyave]'s like, 'It is. It's her party today that you planned.'\"\nMellencamp recalled, \"And I was like, 'Can they please just let me out for today?' And he's like, 'You realize you have not only gone through massive brain surgery, but you have a hole in your head.'\"\nShe continued, \"And, I just remember in that moment he said exactly what I needed him to say. He's like, 'We'll throw another one.' But, like my heart broke because I wonder like will she remember that I wasn't there.\"\nMellencamp Already Commenced Plans For Her Funeral\nDespite remaining positive, Teddi Mellencamp feared the worst after her stage 4 cancer diagnosis.\nShe revealed she had already started her funeral plans during an episode of the \"Two T's In A Pod\" podcast.\nMellencamp told her co-host, Judge, that her dad called her to discuss their family's mausoleum and shared his desire for her to be included in it.\nThe 43-year-old joked that she playfully agreed to her father's suggestion, telling Judge she'd make a trip to Indiana just to visit her own grave.\nKeeping things light, she added that she plans to have \"Hot girls never die\" engraved on her tombstone.",

    "title": "'We are helpless': Asia struggles to cope with punishing heatwave",
    "text": "“It feels like you’re at the wrong end of an air conditioner,” said Franco Malcampo, from Davao City in the Philippines, which is in the grip of a punishing heatwave. His daughter, who is asthmatic, takes a desk fan to study in her sweltering school classroom, but it merely blows hot air in her face. Franco’s family have air conditioning at home, which has to be cranked up full from lunchtime. “Our electric bill has gone up,” he says, which squeezes his sales executive salary. Manila, the sprawling capital of 15 million, hit a record 38.8ºC on April 27. And it was so hot last week that big cats in the zoo were given “bloodsicles” to suck on to avert heat stroke. There have been hospital admissions, mainly due to fainting, headaches and dehydration Kasun Nupearachchi, from Colombo, Sri Lanka From Sri Lanka in the west to Thailand and the Philippines in the east, Asia has been subject to a merciless heatwave that has outdoor workers collapsing and residents flocking to malls for relief. April and May are the hottest months for much of the continent – but this year many countries are breaking records. “It is extremely hot. I am sweating profusely but I am helpless,” Mahesh Solanki, who sells tea at a stall in Gujarat – where it was 41ºC on Thursday – told The National. “I have to work to make ends meet.” In Bangkok, the world’s most visited city, the mercury was in the mid-30s, with 70 per cent humidity and daily thunderstorms this week. Even for Thais used to equatorial conditions, it was “absurdly hot”, one resident told The National. “Families have flocked to shopping malls to take advantage of their air conditioning,” he said. “Most people spend very little time outdoors.” Solutions big and small Scientists warn these super hot spring and summer temperatures are here to stay – and all of the evidence points to climate change as the cause. Ramit Debnath, an assistant professor at the University of Cambridge, who studies the climate in the subcontinent, said there was now a consensus that measures needed to be taken to adapt to a warming climate. “We’re now at the stage where a lot of things have to be viewed from the lens of climate adaptation, especially at the urban and city level,” Prof Debnath said. At a local level, shelters to offer shade from the sun, reflective building surfaces and increases in urban tree cover can reduce the impact of extreme temperatures. And at the top level, governments must do far more to meet targets on emissions. “The stress is on trying to build shading infrastructure and getting the message out that heatwaves are getting real, so prepare yourself,” he said. As another example of how people can cope with or adapt to heatwaves, he said that some schoolchildren in India were being reminded to drink water every 30 minutes. “And usual government guidelines are don’t leave the house unless it’s extremely important,” he said. Other measures, he said, included adding more trees or water features to urban areas, as these can reduce temperatures. Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, part of the London School of Economics, said painting buildings white to reflect the heat was recommended. “Heatwaves are growing in intensity and frequency around the world,” Mr Ward said. “They’re particularly dangerous in those regions already prone to extreme heat. Even healthy people are in danger from the temperatures we see.” India, except in the Himalayan states in the north, has recently witnessed temperatures between 38ºC and 40ºC. The capital, Delhi, sizzled at 42ºC – the hottest day this season – on Tuesday. The national weather agency warned of intense heatwaves in the state of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh this week. According to a study in The Lancet, the annual number of heat-related deaths among over-65s in India between 2017 and 2021, an average of 31,000, was 55 per cent higher than it was between 2000 and 2004, when the annual figure was 20,000. At least eight people were killed in April due to heatwaves in the country, according to media reports. An Indian from Manipur’s tribal community shelters from the sun during a demonstration in New Delhi. EPA Millions of voters have been casting their ballots in peak temperatures as India holds a seven-phase election for its lower house of parliament. Last month, Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari fainted while campaigning in western state of Maharashtra. The Election Commission of India issued an advisory asking voters not to go out during the hottest part of the day, and has made arrangements for drinking water and fans at polling booths. Bangladesh, which typically receives around 130mm of rain in April, had almost none this year as the heatwave broke the record of 76 years. At least 10 deaths were reported across the country last month due to heatstroke. The temperatures last week were hovering at 43ºC, with authorities advising people to not venture out in the sun. Unfortunately it’s locked in for the next two decades, at least. We’re going to see things get worse Bob Ward, Grantham Institute, London School of Economics High temperatures have been baking parts of Sri Lanka, with the mercury on the island nation rising to 39ºC, causing the national meteorological department to issue an “extreme caution” heat advisory. “There have been a few hospital admissions, mainly due to fainting, headaches and dehydration,” Kasun Nupearachchi, a Colombo-based software engineer, told The National. “I am trying to keep cool by using air conditioning or a fan, staying hydrated with water and planning ahead by cancelling or rescheduling activities for the coolest part of the day.” El Nino effect looms Dr Diana Francis, head of the Environmental and Geophysical Sciences Lab at Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi, said the world’s climate is currently being influenced by the El Nino weather system. During an El Nino phase, warmer surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean cause the climate to be warmer, while in the opposite La Nina system, they tend to be cooler. She said that climate change was also partly responsible, as Asia has experienced a trend in which heatwaves are becoming more common and lasting longer. “Attribution studies have found that this is linked to global warming and, more specifically, to the formation of stagnant heat domes over the continent,” Dr Francis said. She said many big cities were facing combinations of high temperatures and humidity, exacerbated by the urban heat island effect, making them “uncomfortable to live in without cooling systems”. Mr Ward warned that there was no respite in sight, with continued increases in temperature inevitable over the coming years. “Unfortunately it’s locked in for the next two decades, at least. We’re going to see things get worse,” he said.News Related - AWS and Clarity AI to use generative AI to boost sustainable investments Cloud computing experts, builders, customers, partners, and technology enthusiasts descend on Las Vegas to attend AWS re:Invent event that runs through December 1.

    "text": "A teenage boy who was killed by a shark while out surfing with his father in\nSouth Australia’s Yorke Peninsula has been remembered as a “kind and respectful kid” with a passion for the water.\nKhai Cowley, 15, was\nattacked while swimming at Ethel Beach, near Innes National Park, about 1.30pm on Thursday.\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Teenager killed in shark attack identified.\nWatch the latest news and stream for free on\n7plus >>\nIt’s understood he had been bitten in the leg.\nAmbulance crews attended the difficult-to-access beach and recovered the boy’s body from the water.\nFriends of the avid surfer have posted tributes on social media, with one writing that the young teenager had “so much potential”.\n“He will hold a place in everyone’s heart,” the family friend wrote.\nKhai’s auntie Lauryn Barley, who has\nset up a fundraiser to help cover funeral costs, said the young teen had the “most beautiful soul (and was) taken from us too soon”.\nBarley wrote that Khai had been attacked by a white pointer, otherwise known as a great white shark.\n“I’m here to try help raise funds for my sister Kate and brother Tim to cover the cost of the funeral service. Any donations will be most appreciated,” she wrote.\nSurfing South Australia also posted a tribute online describing Khai as a “happy, kind and respectful kid” who was “very much loved by his surfing peers”.\n“After the devastating news that one of our Grom surfers, Khai, was involved in a fatal incident at Ethel Beach on December 28th we have been keeping Khai’s family and friends in our thoughts,” it said.\n“Khai was very involved in our surfing community with his passion for surfing stemming from a family with deep surfing roots in SA.\n“He will be greatly missed out in our community and on the water.”\nOver $10,000 has already been raised via the\nGoFundMe.\nIt’s understood Khai had been holidaying with his family at the time.\nThe attack comes after a spate of serious shark bites in recent months, including the fatal attack of 55-year-old Tod Gendle at Granites Beach on the state’s West Coast in October.\nHis was the second shark death this year after 46-year-old teacher Simon Baccanello disappeared without a trace in May while surfing at Walkers Rock Beach, about 365km west of Adelaide.\nStream Free on",
