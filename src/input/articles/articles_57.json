    "text": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE February 29, 2024\nContact: Jessica Felix Romero |\nSojourners and SojoAction Applaud Senate Re-Introduction of the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act\nWashington, D.C. — In response to the introduction of the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act in the Senate, Sojourners and SojoAction President Rev. Adam Russell Taylor said:\n“Sojourners and SojoAction applaud Senators Durbin (D-IL) and Warnock (D-GA) for reintroducing the\n John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act in the Senate. This bill is long overdue and desperately needed legislation to shore up the freedom to vote and protect our democracy. Protecting voting rights is not a partisan issue, it is the foundation of a healthy and legitimate democracy. The freedom to vote is not a given; it has been contested since our nation’s founding and must be fought for and defended, and constantly expanded. Twenty-first century voter suppression and election subversion are designed to deter and limit who votes and whether all votes are counted. There is no more urgent moral cause right now than protecting the right to vote—which benefits and impacts every other issue and justice cause, from maternal and child health to climate change and immigration.\nVoting is a core means of political expression on the part of citizens and demands fair and reliable democratic processes. Each election, we invite people of faith who believe in our vision of democracy to cast their votes according to their conscience. We are now inviting you to share in that vision by making democratic reforms that restore the voice and vote of all citizens in the United States—in essence, the soul of our nation. We share a collective prayer that Congress will be so moved to prioritize and pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement act so we can actualize our shared prosperity through people power.”\n###\nSojourners, a faith-inspired nonprofit, articulates the biblical call to social justice through its magazine and digital publication and convenes, equips, and mobilizes people to put their faith into action.",

    "title": "KINYANJUI: Walking familiar paths through Ngugi wa Thiong'o's stories",
    "text": "As a young student in high school, I was greatly thrilled by the adventures of literature. Having grown up in the rural landscape and appreciative of the cultural heritage of our time, reading Ngugi wa Thiong’o's books felt like walking in familiar territory.\nThe vivid descriptions of the two hills that lay by each other and a river that never stopped flowing were all too close. Ngugi’s live depictions and use of simple language captured my countryside life with amazing accuracy.\nIt made the story all too personal. In A Grain of Wheat, history is relayed in great detail. Not only dwelling on the liberation struggle and its ensuing toll on the socioeconomic fabric, but also the individual struggles that defined the society to its most basic level.\nThe story of Gitogo was particularly devastating. Born dumb and deaf, when the colonial guards invaded his village and ordered everyone to lie down, poor Gitogo decided to run in the confusion.\nThe guard manning the exit opened fire, and in a fraction of a second, he lay in a pool of blood. As was the tradition, the administration reported the success in bringing down a great terrorist who had been a great pain to the colonial office. The scene depicts the personal journey of many caught up in a system that has no patience to understand their circumstances. Innocent victims who paid the ultimate price for the struggle.\nThey are often women and children, but also the disabled. Their story is told through Gitogo. The personal sacrifices that people made in the struggle are often never told.\nGikonyo's story delves into the heart-wrenching narrative that is true to every struggle. After he was released from detention, the thought of going back to his wife and children filled his heart. When you are denied freedom, the longing for home and the images as you left them presented a huge surprise for many returnees.\nFor Gikonyo, the joy is soon cut short when he goes back only to find his wife with a child strapped to her back. This killed his spirit and Gikonyo was never the same. He felt rejected and betrayed by the people he loved the most. The personal journey of the liberation fighters is told in this story.\nWomen caught up with huge families to fend for, and husbands detained with no assurance of coming back. It is often said that if you want to destroy a man, start with his family. The colonial system perfected this tool by mass incarceration of men, both to reduce the population but also to deny the much-needed leadership at the home unit. The betrayal was not just at the hands of the colonists but right within the family.\nThe personal cost of the struggle to the individual tore through the body, mind and spirit. But when all is said and done, we must agree that for the seed to grow, it must die first. For society to evolve, there must be willingness by the individuals to make personal sacrifices for the greater good.\nThere is no hope without sacrifice. Then came the politics of language and the encoded message of enslavement that was perpetuated by the colonial system. As a little boy in early school, I came face to face with the 'monto'. This was a piece of wood that was left among students and anyone who spoke their mother tongue would be given its custody. When the teacher came round, they would ask who had the monto and the necessary punishment would be administered.\nYou would be stigmatised for speaking your mother tongue. Unfortunately, the effects of the monto are still visible today in the Wafulas who cannot utter a word in Bukusu and Wambuis who speak their Gikuyu with the King's intonation. The colonial architecture was meant to destroy not just one generation, but many more after.\nA man who does not know his culture has nothing to teach his children. Slowly, you begin to realise the disorientation of the African soul and the need to decolonise the mind. You cannot teach your culture in a foreign language. In his early short story collection, A Mercedes Funeral, Ngugi narrates how Wahinya, a watchman at Ilmorog Bar and Restaurant, lived in poverty, but upon death, everyone wants to contribute and make the funeral a great send-off.\nSome even suggest making a casket in the shape of a Mercedes to capture the moment. In it, he exposes the hypocrisy of making people great by grandiose funerals. No wonder he chose not to have a Mercedes funeral. Smooth exit. His legacy is not just in life but also in death. Koma thayu, Ngugi (rest in peace, Ngugi).\nCabinet Secretary, Ministry of Investments, Trade and Industry",

    "text": "Lula sanciona lei para proteger mulheres de violência em boates e shows 29 de dezembro de 2023, 16h31 O presidente Luís Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) sancionou, nesta quinta-feira (28/12), uma lei que cria o protocolo “Não é Não”, para prevenção à violência contra a mulher e proteção de vítimas em boates, shows, espetáculos musicais em locais fechados e casas noturnas, com venda de bebida alcóolica. A lei 14.786 não se aplica a cultos ou eventos realizados em locais de natureza religiosa. Conforme a publicação em Diário Oficial da União (DOU), são deveres dos estabelecimentos, em casos de violência, afastar a vítima do agressor, colaborar para a identificação das possíveis testemunhas, solicitar o comparecimento da Polícia Militar e isolar o local onde existam vestígios de violência até a chegada de agente público competente. A ideia é criar uma dinâmica para preservar a integridade da vítima. Os locais que a lei abrange ainda deverão manter na equipe ao menos uma pessoa qualificada para atender ao protocolo, o que inclui preparo para preservação de possíveis provas e assistência à vítima. A lei ainda prevê que, se o estabelecimento dispuser de câmeras de segurança, deve garantir o acesso às imagens à Polícia Civil e preservar, por pelo menos 30 dias, as imagens relacionadas ao episódio. Os estabelecimentos abrangidos poderão adotar ações que julgarem cabíveis para preservar a integridade da denunciante, retirar o ofensor do estabelecimento e criar um código próprio para que as mulheres possam alertar os funcionários. Quanto ao poder público, a lei determina que deverá manter e divulgar a lista “Local Seguro Para Mulheres” com as empresas que possuírem o selo “Não é Não — Mulheres Seguras”. O selo será concedido aos estabelecimentos comerciais não abrangidos pela obrigatoriedade prevista. O protocolo se assemelha ao “No Callem”, criado pela cidade de Barcelona, na Espanha, em 2018, e aplicado no caso Daniel Alves. O dispositivo espanhol foi pensado para combater agressões sexuais e violência machista em espaços de lazer da cidade, como discotecas e bares. Encontrou um erro? [Avise nossa equipe!](#)",

    "text": "Capri Sun, the iconic beverage brand, has announced a significant change to its packaging, introducing a bottle form aimed at adult consumers. The new design, which replaces the traditional silver pouch, was revealed on August 28 in an Instagram post by the food blog Snackolator. The post showcased the new 12-ounce bottles, which will be easier to use as they eliminate the need for a straw. \"Capri Sun is coming for the adults with new bottles that will be arriving in stores soon!\" the post stated, also mentioning that the initial launch will feature three popular flavors: Fruit Punch, Strawberry Kiwi, and Pacific Cooler. The announcement has sparked a wave of reactions from fans on social media, with opinions ranging from excitement to nostalgia. Some fans expressed enthusiasm for the new design. \"All my dreams are coming true,\" one Instagram user commented, while another added, \"I'm definitely going to be on the lookout for those!\" Others, however, are concerned that the new packaging may alter the nostalgic experience of drinking from the pouch. \"I just want it to taste like when I was a kid in the 90s and 2000s,\" one fan wrote, while another said, \"This doesn’t sit well with my spirit.\" One user on X (formerly Twitter) went so far as to call the change \"one of the most shocking product changes in the history of food & beverage.\" Despite the mixed reactions, Capri Sun has not yet announced an official release date for the new bottles, though the post hinted that they would be \"coming soon.\" COMMENTS Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

    "text": "Bison take lead into the Half, but Fall 31-26 to Colorado NDSU FOOTBALL OPENS 2024 SEASON WITH WEEK 1 LOSS TO COLORADO. BOULDER, CO (KVRR)– Since head coach Deion Sanders was hired at Colorado, NDSU had their 2024 week one game against the Buffaloes circled on their calendar. Earlier this year, it was announced it would be a nationally televised game as well, adding even more hype for the 9-time FCS national champions. NDSU entered the showdown in Boulder winners in 9 of their 13 all-time meetings against FBS programs. The Bison opened up their season with a bang. On their opening drive, quarterback Cam Miller connected with running back TK Marshall for a 48-yard completion that set up a successful 36-yard field goal from Griffin Crosa and a 3-0 Bison lead. The Buffaloes offense responded quick, however, with a 41-yard touchdown score from quarterback and Heisman trophy candidate Shedeur Sanders to two-way star Travis Hunter. When NDSU got the ball back, they quickly proved they could hang with FBS programs. Cam Miller led the Bison on a 75-yard drive capped off by a 7-yard touchdown strike to tight end Joe Stoffel. Following that drive, Shedeur Sanders was quick to answer with a 69-yard touchdown pass to give the Buffaloes a 14-10 lead after the first quarter. After doing it with his arm in the first quarter, Miller did it with his legs in the second. The lone second quarter touchdown was scored by NDSU on a 7-yard Miller run helping the Bison to a 20-17 half time lead. After NDSU and Colorado traded punts to begin the third quarter, Shedeur Sanders shined, exploiting the holes in the Bison secondary. Sanders found Hunter for their second touchdown connection of the game quickly after finding wide receiver Jimmy Horn Jr. for 41-yards to set up the score. Leading 24 to 20 entering the fourth quarter, the Sanders-Hunter connection struck for a third time with eight minutes to go in the game, extending the Colorado lead to 11. In all, it was a 17-play drive that ate up over eight minutes of game clock. On the ensuing Bison offensive drive, the Bison converted on a 4th and 1 to keep their comeback hopes alive with just under 5 minutes remaining on a Cole Payton rush up the middle. Later, Miller picked up his second rushing touchdown on the day with a 20-yard dash to cut the Bison deficit to 5. NDSU elected to go for two, but were unsuccessful. Trailing 31-26, Code Green needed a stop to give the Bison offense a crack at the go-ahead score. With under two minutes to go in the game, on third and long, Sanders scrambled and threw the ball down field to LaJohntay Wester. Wester was ran into as he went up for the reception, prompting a pass interference penalty and an automatic first down for Colorado. Code Green was given one more chance at getting the ball back for their offense with one minute and 30 seconds to go in the game. On third and 10, Sanders connected on a 7-yard pass, 3 yards short of a first down. With no timeouts remaining, NDSU got the ball back with just 32 seconds remaining on their own 8-yard line. NDSU needed a miracle. Miller moved the ball down field with a few completions which led to their final chance with 5 seconds to go form the 47-yard line. The Hail Mary pass was caught by Tyler Terhark at the 4-yard line for a gain of 49-yards, but he was quickly tackled giving Colorado the 31-26 week one win. NDSU (0-1) will return to the FargoDome next week, September 7. They will host Tennessee State at 2:30 P.M.
