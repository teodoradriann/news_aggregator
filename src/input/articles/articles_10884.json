    "text": "[NoEresTuSoyYo](/user/NoEresTuSoyYo)a [psypost.org](/go/link/3891531)\nEsto se sabe hace décadas. La gente no grita o pega a sus hijos porque crea realmente que eso les ayude, sino porque sienten el impulso de hacerlo, y las consecuencias a medio o largo plazo les importan una mierda. (Y también cómo se puedan sentir sus hijos, obviamente.)\n[#2](c2#c-2) o los castigos de \"a tu habitación\" o \"al rincón\". Es simplemente porque no puedes lidiar con la situación y te liberas de es situación que no puedes controlar.\n[#7](c7#c-7) Puedes ejercer la autoridad y poner límites a tus hijos sin necesidad de faltarles al respeto ni usar castigos, amenazas, coacción o chantaje emocional.\n[#12](c12#c-12) hay niños y niños, los hay que atienden a razonamientos y losnhay que pasan de tu culo olímpicamente en determinados momentos del día. No es tan fácil.\n[#14](c14#c-14) Nadie dijo que fuera fácil, al contrario, es mucho más difícil. Hay momentos en los que es jodidamente difícil, hay momentos en los que los estrangularías, y hasta hay momentos en los que pierdes los papeles*, como cualquier persona normal. Pero eso no significa que no se merezcan el mismo respeto que cualquier adulto. Lo que muchas veces nos olvidamos es de que su cerebro funciona distinto al nuestro, y que además no saben cómo funciona el mundo, y es nuestra responsabilidad protegerlos, enseñarlos y guiarlos.\n(*: Y las veces que me ha pasado con mi hijo le pido perdón, como haría con cualquier otro.)\n[#16](c16#c-16) totalmente de acuerdo, pero bueno, es que me toca bastante la moral que se venda que todo es posible hablando y explicando las cosas y no, eso no funciona con todos los niños en todo momento.\n[#14](c14#c-14) tengo un sobrino con diagnóstico tdah, creeme que sé que no es fácil. Pero te aseguro que no sirve absolutamente de nada ejercer violencia, amenazar o castigar.\n[#18](c18#c-18) bueno ahí ya hablamos de niños que nunca van a ver el mundo igual que nosotros con lo que interactuar con ellos va a ser siempre de forma diferente.\n[#6](c6#c-6) Estás confundiendo un grito para evitar una situación de peligro, cosa que se haría con cualquiera, niño, adulto o perro, con gritarle a alguien para imponer miedo y autoridad. ¿O te parece igual de bien que te grite alguien por la calle para evitar que te atropellen que que te grite el subnormal de tu jefe?\nLos que están a favor del castigo físico en niños les propongo hacer lo mismo con adultos. Que te pillan infringiendo una norma vial con el coche, una buena bofetada. Que has hecho mal la declaración de la renta, hostia al canto.\nHay muchas maneras de educar, aplicar castigos físicos es la peor de todas y el último recurso de los incompetentes.\n[#3](c3#c-3) El castigo físico siempre va acompañado de insultos verbales, gestuales además de amenazas verbales y físicas.",

    "title": "Herb Kohl, former Jewish senator from Wisconsin and Milwaukee Bucks owner, dies at 88 - Jewish Telegraphic Agency",
    "text": "( JTA ) — Herb Kohl, the longtime Jewish senator from Wisconsin who loved his Milwaukee hometown so much he bought its basketball team to keep it there, has died at 88.\nKohl was known for his soft-spoken, unobtrusive approach as a philanthropist, a retail mogul and a senator, an outlook he said he learned from his Jewish immigrant parents.\nKohl died Wednesday after a short illness, his namesake foundation said.\nElected to the first of four terms in the Senate in 1988, he became an influential member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, where he was a must-meet for pro-Israel lobbyists advocating for defense assistance for Israel. He was a leader on advocacy for children and the elderly, chairing the Senate Aging committee and authoring bills that expanded funding for school lunches and mandated child-safety locks on guns.\n“There was always one constituency that everyone in the office knew was more important to Herb than anyone else, and that was children,” Brad Fitch, a one time spokesman for Kohl, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency in 2011, after Kohl said his fourth term would be his last . “He would say, ‘They don’t contribute to campaigns, they don’t have a lobbyist.’ ”\nHe was also a leader in the Jewish community, helming a campaign that raised millions for Israel in a relatively small community in an emergency campaign after the 1967 Six-Day War .\nYet he abjured attention until his middle age, buying the NBA Milwaukee Bucks franchise in 1985, when he was 50, in order to keep them in the city, and then running for the Senate when he was 53.\n“He loved sports, he loved Milwaukee and Wisconsin,” Bud Selig, the Jewish former Major League Baseball commissioner and a childhood friend of Kohl’s, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel . “I think his career is so really unusual in this day and age.”\nKohl was born and raised in Milwaukee. His parents, Max and Mary, had immigrated to Milwaukee from Poland and Russia, respectively, in the early 20th century. Max Kohl opened a grocery store before Herb was born; by the time he reached adulthood, Herb Kohl, one of four siblings, had helped build an extensive chain of grocery and department stores. Kohl left the management in 1979 of a company that now has over 1,000 stores nationwide.\nKohl said his father instilled in his children a strong work ethic — Herb Kohl started work in the chain as a bag boy. He said he also learned from his father to keep his emotions in check.\n“My father was a person who had a very strong control over his ego and his needs,” USA Today, in its obituary , quoted Kohl as once saying. “He was a very driven man, but he was not a person who had the need to belittle people or fight with people or reduce them. He learned to control those impulses, which we all have, I think. He was a very controlled, disciplined person, and he was very influential on me in that respect.”\nIn 2016, speaking to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel , Kohl said his father taught him to give back to a community that had welcomed them.\n“My father once said, ‘Money is like manure. It’s not good unless you spread it around,’” he told the newspaper. “Maybe the day I die all the money will be gone. Whatever. I’ve had a productive life. A happy life. A healthy life. And I never forget it. I’m very grateful for all the good luck I’ve had in my lifetime.”\nHis Jewish expression was low-key but had significant effect. Kohl asked Ray Allen, a star player with the Bucks, to accompany him in 1998 on a tour of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, and it changed the player forever. He was soon urging fellow players to join him on tours whenever they were in Washington to play the Wizards . Allen joined the museum’s council in 2016 .\nKohl was for a period in the 1990s and 2000s part of an anomalous group of Jewish senators elected from northern midwestern states with small Jewish populations. Russ Feingold served as the junior Wisconsin senator from 1993-2011, and there was a rotation of Jewish senators in neighboring Minnesota in the same period.\nSen. Herb Kohl meets with then Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan, May 12, 2010. (Office of Senator Herb Kohl)\nIn the Senate, the Democratic politician’s focus was on oversight and keeping spending within budgets. “I’m running as a businessman,” the Journal Sentinel quoted him as saying in its obituary. “I’m a person who hasn’t spent a nickel until he made a nickel.”\nKohl self-funded his campaigns so he wouldn’t be beholden to others, and he did not take kindly to the super-rich.\n“The one thing I’ve never appreciated is when I meet people who are successful and some of them think it’s all about them, that they’re the ones who made the success and they deserve all the credit,” he told the Sentinel Journal in his 2016 interview. “Big egos. Dominating personalities. That’s a bad way to be. I don’t like people who are overweening in their self-esteem because they’re wrong and it doesn’t bode well for people around them. Too often, they’re also selfish and greedy. It’s a bad characteristic and I’ve always worked as hard as I can not to be suffused in that kind of thinking.”\nPresident Joe Biden said his former Senate colleague, one of the richest men in Wisconsin, did not keep easy company with fellow multimillionaires.\n“Throughout his career, Herb was unafraid to stand up to the business community that he’d come from, seeking to level the playing field for workers and make our economy more efficient and fair,” Biden said in a statement Thursday.\nHis passion was Wisconsin, where he was familiar with the minutiae of its dairy farms, holding up the budget in 1999 for hours until he got through the state’s farmers’ desired dairy pricing reforms.\nThe best part of Kohl’s day was meeting constituents. Each day between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. was coffee and muffins with Wisconsinites.\n​​“Trying to drag Herb for a hearing away from those breakfasts was impossible,” Fitch said in 2011.\nKohl bought the Bucks in 1985 when it was rumored that their ailing owner was set to sell the team to buyers who would move the franchise. He dumped millions into the struggling team to keep it in Milwaukee, and when he sold it in 2014, he offered a discount in part to extract a promise that the new owners would keep the team in Wisconsin, and he pledged $100 million to build a new stadium to clinch the deal.\nHe also gave out $10 million to Bucks employees in bonuses.\n“Every day I remind myself how fortunate I’ve been because so much of life is luck,” Kohl said told the Journal Sentinel in 2016. “I was born into a great family, had a great opportunity at Kohl’s, and on and on. I’ve had many, many great experiences and very few bad experiences. So what more can you ask for?”\nKohl, who never married, is survived by his siblings and their children. A nephew, Dan Kohl, helped found J Street , the liberal Jewish Middle East policy group, and ran for Congress unsuccessfully in 2018 .\nShare this: Twitter Facebook WhatsApp",

    "text": "Follow – aware\nOil prices rose for the second session in a row, today, Thursday, as they received support from the possibility of OPEC+ producers taking a decision against increasing production in an important meeting held later today.\nBrent crude futures rose by 0.8 percent to $64.60 per barrel, by 05:53 GMT, after rising by more than two percent yesterday, Wednesday.\nWhile West Texas Intermediate crude futures also rose by 0.8 percent to $61.74 per barrel.\nThree sources in the OPEC+ group, which includes the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, said that the group is considering extending production cuts until April, instead of increasing production, as the recovery in demand for oil is still fragile due to the Corona virus crisis.\nThe market expected that OPEC would ease production cuts by about 500,000 barrels per day, starting next April, and that Saudi Arabia, the largest producer in OPEC, would end a voluntary reduction in its production of an additional one million barrels per day.\nSource: Reuters",
