    "text": "Filed under:\nVegas Restaurant Closings Salt Bae Has Sprinkled His Final Golden Steaks in Las Vegas The Nusr-Et steakhouse, known for its thousand-dollar steaks, is closing\nby Janna Karel Jan 30, 2025, 11:51am PST Share this story Share All sharing options for: Salt Bae Has Sprinkled His Final Golden Steaks in Las Vegas\nSalt Bae. / Janna Karel is the Editor for Eater Vegas. Eight years ago, chef Nusret Gökçe became a meme incarnate when a video of him bouncing grains of salt off his forearm and onto a steak garnered millions of views. The Internet hype was enough to propel the newly dubbed Salt Bae to open restaurants in New York City, Dallas, Beverly Hills, and Las Vegas. His Strip steakhouse, Nusr-Et, located at the Park near Park MGM, drew a fair deal of attention when it opened, serving edible golden-covered steaks for over $1,000 each, but has largely faded from relevance in recent years. The company announced that Nusr-Et is shaking up its operations and launching in new markets, which means closing its Las Vegas restaurant.\nIn a release, Salt Bae’s Nusr-Et announced that the company will close its Las Vegas restaurant, with plans to reopen at a new location, but didn’t elaborate on the current restaurant’s last day of service. In addition to closing Nusr-Et in Vegas, Gökçe closed one of his New York restaurants in May and announced Nusr-Et’s closure in Dallas, Texas. He’s planning to expand into the Latin American market with a Mexico City opening slated for 2025.\nA painting of Salt Bae in Nusr-Et New York. Nusr-et Steakhouse In some ways, Nusr-Et seemed like a no-brainer for Las Vegas. Staff would ferry wagyu steaks to tables wrapped in 24K gold foil and priced at $1,500 — just the kind of spectacle and showmanship that, on paper, should work on the Strip. Dessert could also come covered in gold leaf, like the $75 pistachio baklava, while pricey sides took the form of truffle macaroni and cheese. The $39 prix fixe lunch of an appetizer, steak, and dessert was an admittedly great deal. But this is also in a city already saturated with top-notch steakhouses, where Nusr-Et’s $650 “golden steak” had to compete with acclaimed restaurants like Bavette’s at the next-door Park MGM.\nDespite the charm of having a living Internet meme personally salting one’s steaks, Salt Bae’s brand has not been without controversy. In 2019, a former server at the Manhattan restaurant filed a class-action lawsuit alleging Gökçe was pocketing tips. Two years later, employees filed an overtime wage lawsuit aimed at Gökçe’s restaurants in New York and Miami — it was eventually dismissed. And then there was that time Salt Bae got himself banned from the US Open Cup final after weirdly holding and kissing the FIFA World Cup trophy.\nThe company insists that Nusr-Et will eventually return to Las Vegas. And the brand announced that it is preparing to open new locations in Ibiza, Rome, Milan, and beyond. So that subset of fans of both Internet memes and $1,000-plus steaks shall fear not — Salt Bae’s coming back.\nSign up for the newsletter Eater Vegas Sign up for our newsletter.\nThanks for signing up!

    "title": "Surf pounds West Coast, Hawaii, causes flooding - The Columbian",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES — Powerful surf rolled onto beaches on the West Coast and Hawaii on Thursday as a big swell generated by the stormy Pacific Ocean pushed toward shorelines, causing localized flooding. Forecasters urged people to stay off rocks and jetties, and to not turn their backs to the ocean because of the danger of “sneaker waves” — occasional much bigger waves that can run far up the sand and wash someone off a beach. A high surf warning for parts of Northern California said waves would range from 28 to 33 feet and up to 40 feet at some locations, the National Weather Service said, adding that there were reports of flooding in low-lying coastal areas. In Aptos on the north end of Monterey Bay, surf overran the beach and swept into a parking lot, leaving the area strewn with debris. Santa Cruz County issued warnings for people in several coastal areas to be ready to evacuate. “Mother Nature’s angry,” said Eve Krammer, an Aptos resident for several years. “I mean these waves are gnarly. They’re huge.” The same area was battered by the ocean last January as the West Coast was slammed by numerous atmospheric rivers. “I feel for the people that are down low here,” said Jeff Howard, also an Aptos resident. While not quite as huge, the waves along Southern California were also described as hazardous, with life-threatening rip currents. Nonetheless, surfers couldn’t resist. Patience was key, according to Alex Buford, 27, who was catching waves just north of Manhattan Beach on the Los Angeles County coast. “I was waiting for awhile because the waves were really sick, and they’re kinda hard to get into even though I have a really big board,” he said. “Just waited for a good one and I got it and it was a long one. Pretty big. It was sick.” In Hawaii, the weather service forecast surf rising to 30 to 40 feet along north-facing shores and 18 to 22 feet along west-facing shores of five islands. Professional Hawaii surfer Sheldon Paishon was getting ready to surf Thursday morning at Makaha, a world-famous surfing beach on Oahu’s west side. Paishon, 30, has been surfing at various spots around Oahu this week, taking advantage of waves during this week’s high surf warning in effect till this morning. “It’s always big waves in the winter time in Hawaii,” he said. He warned that novice surfers should check with lifeguards before heading into the water and “make sure you got some people around you and stay safe.” Honolulu Ocean Safety lifeguards, posted at beaches across Oahu, rescued 20 people along the island’s famed North Shore on Wednesday, said spokesperson Shayne Enright. They were also busy with thousands of “preventative actions,” she said. “This time of year produces incredible surf but it can also be very dangerous,” she said. The dangerous surf could also cause surges that could hit coastal properties and roadways, the weather service warned.",

    "text": "How rock-bottom prices drive shortages of generic drugs used in hospitals Steven Coventry spent 20 years at the Akorn pharmaceutical factory in Decatur, Ill., and worked his way up to operations manager. The plant closed abruptly in February 2023, when the company shut down its four manufacturing facilities. In Decatur, Akorn laid off 400 employees. But Coventry went back to work at the Decatur plant last summer because new owners hired him to essentially resume his old job and bring it back to life. It was a surreal scene. \"Coffee mugs were left on tabletops, personal items,\" he said. \"It was kind of like a ghost town and a little sad to go through and see, you know, people's lives just basically upended.\" Coventry says the factory used to make 100 different products. The shutdown contributed to new drug shortages and made some others worse. He's glad to be back. \"It's like home. It's where I grew up,\" he said. \"I was really driven to ... bring it back up to its glory days of what it was in the past.\" Low prices bring unintended consequences When Americans think of drug prices, they usually think that they're too high. And for name brand drugs, that's often the case compared with the rest of the world. But when it comes to [generic sterile injectables](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/federal-policies-to-address-persistent-generic-drug-shortages/), medicines that are workhorses in hospitals, the opposite problem is true. They can be too cheap. \"For off-patent generic drugs, especially those used in the hospital setting, Americans actually pay lower prices than Europe does,\" said [Rena Conti](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profile/rena-conti/), a professor at the Boston University Questrom School of Business. Companies compete with each other to offer hospital purchasers the lowest price, driving the prices to rock bottom. Over time, prices can get so low that it doesn't always make good business sense for the companies to keep making some drugs. So they stop. \"It's the same issues that we've been dealing with for many years, especially with these older generic drugs that are having fewer and fewer manufacturers making them,\" [Valerie Jensen](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-insight/fda-insight-drug-shortages-and-covid-19), associate director for drug shortages at the Food and Drug Administration, told NPR. \"There isn't a lot of buffer when something goes wrong on the manufacturing line.\" With fewer suppliers of generic drugs, a weather event – like the tornado that ripped through a Pfizer facility earlier this year or Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017 – can wreak havoc on an already fragile system. On top of that, the bargain-basement prices don't encourage manufacturers to invest in new equipment and other things that would keep quality high and avert recalls and shutdowns. \"I would say, fundamentally, economics is causing this problem, and this problem is long-standing,\" Conti said. \"We've been dealing with periodic and, more concerningly, persistent shortages in drugs ... for the better part of a decade or a little bit more. And fundamentally, the economics of this market has to change in order to get resilient supply.\" What happened to Akorn? Erin Fox is a hospital pharmacist who oversees purchasing drugs, medication safety and more for the University of Utah Health System. Like her peers across the country, she was caught off guard by Akorn's demise last winter. \"We actually got an email from our representative and he just said, 'Hey, we just walked in today. We learned that we're closing. Everyone has to leave today,' \" she said. \"So it was very abrupt.\" The company went bankrupt after operating at a loss \"for some time\" and failing to get acquired by a company that would cover its liabilities, Akorn's CEO said in a [letter to employees last February](https://herald-review.com/read-it-akorn-layoff-letter-to-employees/pdf_833fc5c8-b2e4-11ed-b91b-175da6b5f0d1.html) that was obtained by the Herald and Review in Decatur. As soon as Fox got the news, she and her colleagues at University of Utah Health started poring over lists of medicines to see how the shutdown would affect them. Fox's team asked their Akorn rep if they could use what they had on shelves, and the answer that day was \"yes.\" The relief wouldn't last. Six weeks later, Akorn recalled all the products it had made. There was nothing wrong with the drugs, and they hadn't expired. But no one was left at Akorn to answer the phone or initiate a specific recall if a problem did emerge. \"So you can't use it anymore,\" she said of Akorn's product line. \"There's no gray area there.\" Staffers at University of Utah Health had to log an extra 250 hours right away to deal with the fallout, taking Akorn products off shelves and finding replacements. Products included things like the opioid sufentanil, which is often used in epidurals during labor and delivery. There are alternatives, but anesthesiologists prefer working with what they know best to reduce the chances for medical errors. Akorn was also the only supplier of dimercaprol, an injectable antidote for lead poisoning. There are oral alternatives, but some patients are too sick to take them. Rising from Akorn's ashes A few months after Akorn shut down, Rising Pharmaceuticals acquired the former Akorn factory in Illinois. Rising plans to manufacture several of the generic products Akorn used to make there. \"Our intention is to really focus on those products of greatest need in the U.S. pharma marketplace and bring those back on,\" Ira Baeringer, Rising's chief operating officer, told NPR. These include injectable forms of the antibiotic levofloxacin, the anesthetic tetracaine and droperidol, a medication to prevent nausea. Rising also plans to bring back several former Akorn eyedrop products in short supply. But getting the factory up and running again is tricky because the water, air and mechanical systems had been shut down for so long. Normally, those systems run continuously. \"That takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of effort,\" Baeringer said. \"And once a facility is shut down, it means all those systems have to be revalidated. And so that's the process that we're going through right now to bring ... this facility back up into commercial production.\" He said Rising hopes the factory will be making products by the second half of 2024. But what will keep Rising from going the same way Akorn did? \"Honestly, there's probably very little that can happen to prevent it,\" said Fox of University of Utah Health, explaining that it will depend on many factors, including which products Rising chooses and how it prices them. \"So I think it's really hard to know if they'll be able to make it a success or not.\" She said she hopes Rising can get a leg up from \"people that want to keep manufacturing in the U.S.\" The Biden administration has taken steps toward mitigating drug shortages, including expanding its use of the Defense Production Act to bolster domestic manufacturing of medicines deemed critical for national defense. The administration is also investing $35 million in domestic manufacturing of key starting materials for sterile injectable drugs. \"I'm hopeful,\" Fox said of the Illinois factory. \"But we'll just have to see how it works out.\" Copyright 2023 NPR.

    "title": "India's central bank currency swap will enhance economic activity among SAARC countries",
    "text": "New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in collaboration with the Government of India, has recently (June27, 2024) introduced an updated Currency Swap Arrangement Framework for SAARC countries, effective from 2024 to 2027. This initiative is designed to support short-term foreign exchange liquidity needs and address balance of payment crises within the SAARC region. Originally launched on November 15, 2012, the SAARC Currency Swap Facility aims to provide a financial safety net for these countries.\nA new INR Swap Window with a corpus of ₹250 billion is part of the new structure, offering different concessions for swap assistance in Indian Rupee. Furthermore, the US Dollar/Euro Swap Window, which has a US$ 2 billion total corpus, would continue to be maintained by the RBI. All SAARC member nations will have access to the facility, provided they accept the bilateral swap agreements.\nSAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) comprises Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. The economic structures of these countries vary significantly; India is the largest economy in the region with an economic size of USD 3572 billion followed by Bangladesh at USD 446 billion, Pakistan USD 338 billion, Sri Lanka USD 84 billion, Nepal USD 41 billion, Afghanistan USD 14 billion, Maldives USD 7 billion and Bhutan USD 3 billion.\nIndia is the leading SAARC economy, providing support to all the other nations; facilitation in their socio-economic developments and growth of the financial sector. The revised currency swap to the SAARC nations will provide the following advantages:\nStability and Confidence: During periods of market turbulence, the currency swap facility serves as a financial safety net, reassuring investors and stabilizing local currencies. The existence of swap agreements helps reduce uncertainty and preserves stability in financial markets when nations experience abrupt currency decline or external shocks. Because of its stability, investors are more confident, which promotes ongoing investment and economic expansion.\nLiquidity Support: Through the swap framework, members of the SAARC will have access to foreign exchange reserves. With this access, central banks are guaranteed to be able to efficiently handle their short-term liquidity requirements, which include funding imports and maintaining exchange rates. The framework lowers the risk of financial disruptions and facilitates smooth economic operations by preventing shortages of money.\nStrengthened Economic relations: This system encourages greater financial integration, which strengthens relations between the SAARC countries economically. Increased financial cooperation promotes cooperative development projects, trade, and cross-border investments. This integration creates the groundwork for greater regional economic cooperation and shared wealth in addition to bolstering economic resilience.\nTrade Facilitation: Smoother trade transactions within the SAARC area are made possible by stable exchange rates, which are made possible by the currency swap mechanism. For businesses that deal internationally, predictable exchange rates, lower transaction costs and exchange rate risks becomes benign. Using member state comparative advantages, this benefit promotes higher trade volumes, strengthens regional trade dynamics, and aids in economic efficiencies progress.\nDebt Management: The stability of the economy depends on the efficient management of external debt. The currency swap agreement gives member nations quick access to foreign exchange reserves, giving them a tool to manage their external debt. By ensuring that nations can satisfy their international financial responsibilities without placing undue strain on their economies, this proactive approach helps prevent possible debt crises.\nCrisis Mitigation: The swap facility acts as a quick reaction tool in times of economic crisis, such as unexpected problems with the balance of payments or turbulence in the financial markets. Through prompt provision of money to nations experiencing financial difficulties, the framework lessens the immediate effects of crises and bolsters attempts to stabilize the economy. This proactive crisis management capacity strengthens the SAARC region's overall financial resilience.\nIndia's trade with SAARC Countries\nIndia's trade relations with SAARC countries are significant, with particular emphasis on its interactions with Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bhutan, where the trade volume exceeds one USD billion. The overall trade dynamics with these countries underscore India's role as a pivotal economic player in the region, fostering mutual growth and stability.\nWithin the SAARC countries, according to the recent data for FY 2023-24, Bangladesh emerges as one of India's largest trade partners in the SAARC region, with total trade valued at around USD 13 billion. This strong trade relationship is driven by India's export of goods such as cotton, machinery, and vehicles, while importing textiles, fish, and leather goods from Bangladesh.\nNepal is another significant trade partner, with total trade amounting to around USD 8 billion. Major exports to Nepal include petroleum products, vehicles, and machinery, whereas imports from Nepal are textiles, tea, and carpets.\nIndia’s trade with Sri Lanka's amounted to USD 5.4 billion, key exports to Sri Lanka include petroleum products, textiles, and pharmaceuticals and key imports include ships, boats, aircraft, spacecraft, edible fruits and nuts, beverages and electrical machinery\nBhutan also represents a crucial trade partner, with total trade reaching USD 1.2 billion. India's exports primarily consist of electricity, machinery, and consumer goods, while Bhutan's exports are mainly electricity and minerals.\nIndia’s trade with other SAARC countries including Afghanistan, Bhutan Maldives and Pakistan is around USD 1 billion.\nIndia’s significant trade partnerships with major SAARC countries including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bhutan are attributed to historical ties, geographic proximity, and complementary economic structures. These countries rely on India for essential imports, while India benefits from their exports of textiles, minerals, and agricultural products.\nIn conclusions, the Reserve Bank of India's updated Currency Swap Framework for SAARC nations is a move meant to improve economic cooperation and financial stability in the SAARC region. With bilateral swap agreements, this framework seeks to minimize balance of payment situations and promote stronger economic relations among the SAARC nations while offering short-term cash support.\nIndia's commitment to regional economic resilience is demonstrated by the creation of an INR Swap Window in addition to ongoing support in USD and EUR. Despite possible geopolitical and economic obstacles, this proactive step is essential for meeting short-term financial requirements and fostering long-term economic integration. In a nutshell, the framework is a major step towards a more stable and cooperative economic environment in South Asia.\nRelated Topics:",

    "title": "Una obsesión inspiradora: la película que Orson Welles vio 40 veces antes de rodar ‘Ciudadano Kane’, su obra maestra",
    "text": "En la víspera de Halloween de 1938, Orson Welles estremecía a la población estadounidense con un relato radiofónico en el que, adaptando ‘La guerra de los mundos’ de H. G. Welles, se narraba con todo realismo una invasión extraterrestre en el planeta Tierra, haciendo que millones de personas colapsaran de pánico. El episodio tuvo tanto éxito que le reportó fama mundial, hecho que los estudios RKO Pictures, entonces una de las grandes potencias del cinematógrafo, aprovecharon para lanzarse a su contratación, otorgándole total libertad creativa para el desarrollo de dos películas y convirtiéndolo en el nuevo niño prodigio de Hollywood a los 24 años de edad.\norson welles\nAunque su primer proyecto, una adaptación de ‘El corazón de las tinieblas’ de Joseph Conrad, fue rechazado por los estudios, Welles preparó de manera minuciosa su asalto a la cima del séptimo arte con el que sería su primer filme, ‘Ciudadano Kane’. Para ello, Orson Welles moldeó un equipo de profesionales que encarnaban la excelencia en cada uno de sus campos, a saber: Herman J. Mankiewicz en la escritura del guion, Bernard Herrmann en la composición de la banda sonora, el a la postre director Robert Wise en el montaje y el innovador Gregg Toland como director de fotografía.\norson welles ciudadano kane\nLas nociones del lenguaje cinematográfico que tenía Orson Welles hasta el momento en el que tuvo que enfrentarse al rodaje de ‘Ciudadano Kane’ eran escasas, puesto que toda su experiencia se basaba en su carrera en el teatro. Para empaparse de ello, Welles pidió a George Schaefer, presidente de la RKO, que le proporcionase una sala de proyección y una copia de ‘La diligencia’ de John Ford, película que se había estrenado poco tiempo antes y que hoy en día está considerada como uno de los tótems del género western.\nEn el libro escrito conjuntamente por Peter Bogdanovich y Orson Welles titulado ‘This is Orson Welles’, el realizador afirmó haber visto ‘La diligencia’ unas 40 veces como preparación antes del rodaje de ‘Ciudadano Kane’: “Como se vio después, el primer día que caminé por un set fue mi primer día como director. Había aprendido todo lo que sabía en la sala de proyección, de Ford. Después de cenar, cada noche durante aproximadamente un mes estuve proyectando ‘La diligencia’, a menudo con algún técnico distinto o jefe de departamento del estudio, y haciendo preguntas. «¿Cómo se hizo?» «¿Por qué se hizo?». Era como ir a la escuela.”\norson welles ciudadano kane\n‘La diligencia’, cuyo guion estuvo hábilmente escrito por Dudley Nichols, está basado en el relato ‘Bola de sebo’ de Guy de Maupassant. El filme de John Ford hizo que el director de ‘Ciudadano Kane’ desarrollase una devoción casi religiosa hacia la que él consideraba la obra maestra que mejor encarnaba la perfección cinematográfica. El obsesivo estudio que Orson Welles hizo de la narrativa, la puesta en escena y el montaje quedaron sin duda patentes en su ópera prima, donde la alargada sombra del maestro John Ford se fundió con su visión única.",

    "text": "In New York City, the snow didn't cool down Buffalo Bills fans on Monday, January 15. While their team's game with the Pittsburg Steelers had already been postponed by a day due to a snowstorm, American football fans got their hands dirty. The goal is for the match to take place as scheduled. To ensure that the stadium was ready on time, supporters of both clubs did not hesitate to arm themselves with shovels to make the stands accessible to spectators. To thank them, they received a financial compensation of $20 per hour, free breakfast and drinks.\nRead also\"French American football\": the Musketeers of Paris, an ambitious young club\nAt the same time, bulldozers were busy on the ground to clear the snow. Mission accomplished: the match was able to take place on time. The temperature at kick-off was -8°C with a feeling of -16°C. The fans didn't hesitate to make the snow fly to celebrate each touchdown, in a good-natured atmosphere punctuated by snowball fights. The weather brought luck to the Buffalo Bills.
