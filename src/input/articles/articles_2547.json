    "text": "The government announced a complete prohibition on the production, marketing, and distribution of all types of plastic bags and packaging, regardless of whether they are biodegradable or single-use. Environment Minister Roger Baro stated that the new law aims to address the environmental hazards posed by plastic waste. Burning plastic products releases persistent organic pollutants, which contribute to deteriorating public health. The government’s decision is motivated by the alarming impact of plastic waste on the environment and the health of the population. Plastic pollution is responsible for the deaths of 30 percent of Burkina Faso’s livestock. Minister Baro emphasized the government’s commitment to supporting stakeholders in transitioning to alternative materials. A six-month grace period has been granted for businesses to comply with the new regulations, which will be submitted to Parliament. The government plans to promote the use of bio-based materials as alternatives to plastic. Minister Baro stated, “We already have bio-based materials in our country. We are going to put a system in place so that by banning plastics, non-plastics can be promoted and made available for all uses.” Burkina Faso has been at the forefront of efforts to reduce plastic pollution. The country’s initial ban on non-biodegradable plastic packaging and bags, enacted in 2014, has laid the groundwork for the more comprehensive ban announced today. DS/Sf/ac/fss/abj/APA",
