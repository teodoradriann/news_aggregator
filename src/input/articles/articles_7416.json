El mandatario reafirmó que la línea coherente e invariable del país es encaminarse a un desarrollo sostenible y adaptable al cambio climático, una economía verde, circular y amigable con el medio ambiente, hacia el cumplimiento de la meta de cero emisiones netas para el 2050. “La primavera es la estación de los brotes, las nuevas hojas y la esperanza. Plantar árboles es una acción hermosa y significativa. Cada planta sembrada es un regalo inapreciable para las generaciones futuras. Los árboles nos dan cosas vitales, por lo que debemos protegerlos y sembrar más plantas con nuestro amor, agradecimiento y humildad hacia la naturaleza”, manifestó. Según el estadista, esta labor contribuirá a la construcción de un Vietnam cada vez más verde, limpio, hermoso y sostenible, además de reafirmar la responsabilidad nacional con la comunidad internacional en la preservación ambiental a favor de la superación de los desafíos globales por un planeta verde. /",

    "title": "Veteran wounded in Iraq receives new, mortgage-free home",
    "text": "BOONE COUNTY, W.Va. (WSAZ) - A West Virginia veteran wounded during his tour in Iraq opened the literal door to a new chapter in life Thursday. Robert Cowan, an Army veteran, received a new, mortgage-free, fully-furnished, home in Danville from the Military Warriors Support Foundation along with Bank of America. Cowan joined the U.S. Army in 1993. He served as a medic in high-risk obstetrics and labor & delivery, with Armor, Infantry, Recon, and Psy Ops. During his deployment to Iraq in December 2004, Robert was wounded in combat and medically retired after 16 years of service in 2009. After going through the application process, the organization found Robert to be the perfect candidate for a new home. “These guys like Robert have laid their lives on the line, they’ve laid it all out with the sacrifice that they had,” said Dave Lieske of Military Warriors Support. “It means a great deal to be able to give back, that’s why we do what we do because we want to give back to these guys.” Cowan said while the home will make his life easier, he’ll move forward thinking of those he served with who were lost along the way. “I appreciate it more than I can ever say, but the heroes are the friends who didn’t come back and, I just did my job,” he said. Though he’s not certain what his next steps will be, he is looking forward to his new life in Danville. “There’s a lot to discover and it’s going to be great, it’s going to be an adventure.” Robert said now that a home is taken care of he’s hoping to go back to school to seek a new degree.

    "text": "OTTAWA — Health Canada is reminding Canadians about a recall of home bed assist handles after learning of an additional death. Four models of bed handles distributed by Drive Medical were first recalled two years ago after two reported deaths — one in Canada and one in the U.S. Health Canada says as of Dec. 19, the company has received a report of a second death in this country. The metal handles are affixed alongside the mattress to help people get in and out of their regular bed at home. The products are not designed for hospital beds. Health Canada says more than 68,000 of the affected handles were sold between 2016 and 2021 in Canada. It says consumers should stop using them and contact Drive Medical Canada to get a refund. The recalled home bed assist model numbers are 15064, 15062, RTL15073 and RTL15063-ADJ. No information has been provided about what caused any of the deaths, but the recall notice says that retention straps were not properly secured in the initial cases in Canada and the U.S. Drive Medical has also learned of an additional three deaths in the U.S. that happened before Dec. 6, 2021, when the recall was first issued. More than 496,000 of the bed assist products were distributed in the U.S. between 2007 and 2021. The products were sold on Amazon. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.

    "text": "[Arsenal](/football/arsenal/) etched their name into an unwanted chapter of Premier League history during their [2-0 defeat](/football/arsenal/result/dogged-west-ham-punish-sloppy-arsenal-in-derby-victory_532356.html) to London rivals [West Ham United](/football/west-ham-united/) at the Emirates Stadium.\nOwing to Liverpool's 2-0 success over Burnley on Boxing Day, which saw the Reds establish up a two-point lead at the top, only a win would have sufficed for\n[Mikel Arteta](/people/mikel-arteta/)'s side if they were to return to the summit of [the standings](/football/premier-league/table.html).\nThe Gunners welcomed West Ham to their Emirates headquarters having gone unbeaten in their first nine top-flight home games of the new term - winning seven in a row across all tournaments in front of their own fans - but they produced an uncharacteristically lacklustre display on Thursday.\nGoals from\n[Tomas Soucek](/people/tomas-soucek/) and former Arsenal defender [Dinos Mavropanos](/people/dinos-mavropanos/) saw [David Moyes](/people/david-moyes/) claim his first-ever managerial away win against the Gunners at the 23rd attempt, and the hosts' evening could have become even more chastening had [David Raya](/people/david-raya/) not kept out an injury-time [Said Benrahma](/people/said-benrahma/) penalty.\nWest Ham spent the vast majority of the match camped inside their own half, but the Irons' defensive display was exceptional, as Arsenal had 77 touches in the West Ham penalty box without finding the back of the net.\nSince data became available at the start of the 2008-09 season, no Premier League team has had more touches in the penalty area in a single game without scoring, and Arteta conceded that West Ham were simply superior in both boxes on the night.\nSpeaking in his post-game press conference, as quoted by\n[football.london](/fwd/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm9vdGJhbGwubG9uZG9uL2Fyc2VuYWwtZmMvZml4dHVyZXMtcmVzdWx0cy9ldmVyeS13b3JkLWFyc2VuYWwtYm9zcy1taWtlbC0yODM2MTM4NQ=/?fwd=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.football.london%2Farsenal-fc%2Ffixtures-results%2Fevery-word-arsenal-boss-mikel-28361385&sport=1&spName=Football&spArticle=x_Arsenal_break_unwanted%20Pre), Arteta said: \"When you look at how much we generated in the game, to see the result is very disappointing. But they were better than us in both boxes.\n\"They had two shots, - with the penalty three. We had 30, I don't know how many touches in the box, how many situations, how many opportunities to score and we haven't done it. In football you have to do that better if you want to win. Today we haven't won because of that.\n\"If we don't score with 30 shots, then we have to do 50 or 60 to try to score. That's the only thing. I can't imagine a game where we have more touches in the box, more dominance and less situations for the opponent against a really good West Ham side. Today, though, it wasn't enough to win the game.\"\nA thick cloud of controversy overshadowed the visitors' opener, though, as Soucek finished from close range after the linesman on the far side deemed that\n[Jarrod Bowen](/people/jarrod-bowen/) had just about prevented the ball from going behind for a goal kick.\nThe VAR team spent a couple of minutes perusing all available angles, but there was no conclusive evidence that the ball had gone out of play given that Bowen's body was blocking the best view, and the goal stood.\n[Bukayo Saka](/people/bukayo-saka/) led the Arsenal charge in the remainder of the first half, forcing [Alphonse Areola](/people/alphonse-areola/) into an acrobatic save from a header before hitting the post and seeing the rebound bounce off [Leandro Trossard](/people/leandro-trossard/) and behind.\nWith just 10 minutes gone in the second half, Mavropanos peeled away from\n[Oleksandr Zinchenko](/people/oleksandr-zinchenko/) to meet a [James Ward-Prowse](/people/james-ward-prowse/) corner, and a stranded Raya could only watch the Greek's header deflect off the bar and post on its way in.\nAsked about Soucek's contentious opener, which bore a resemblance to\n[Anthony Gordon](/people/anthony-gordon/)'s winner for Newcastle United last month, Arteta held himself back from launching into another scathing rant akin to his St James' Park tirade.\n\"I haven't seen it. They're saying it's not conclusive. It's a shame that with the technology that we have, that it's not that clear so that we can say whether it's out or in. It's done. It's gone. There's nothing we can do about it now,\" Arteta responded.\n\"If the technology we have at the moment is not good enough to give us that answer, what we have to do is without that win the game. With the number of situations we generated in the game, that should have been more than enough.\"\nArsenal have one final chance to end 2023 on a positive note when they head to Craven Cottage to meet Fulham in another London derby on New Year's Eve.",

    "title": "ESA Gives Us a Glimpse of its Future Space Exploration Plans with a Cool New Video",
    "text": "The [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/) (ESA) has made incredible contributions to space exploration and space-based science. Last year, the agency launched the Euclid space telescope, which will survey the Universe back to 3 billion years after the Big Bang to measure cosmic expansion and the influence of Dark Energy. After more than a decade of development, the [Ariane 6](https://www.arianespace.com/vehicle/ariane-6/) launch vehicle conducted its [first full-scale dress rehearsal](https://www.universetoday.com/164450/ariane-6-fires-its-engines-simulating-a-flight-to-space/), which included an engine fire test. In a [recent video](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Videos/2024/01/ESA_s_future_of_space_travel), the ESA showcased its plans for the future, which include some new launch vehicles and engine technology. As the ESA describes it in the statement accompanying the video’s release, “brand-new rockets are set to take flight, some reusable, some carbon-neutral, with hybrid propulsion, two and three stages, small, large, crewed and uncrewed, to Earth orbit and deep space, the journey continues.” The video provides a rundown of the technologies the ESA has in the works, which includes footage of hot fire tests and other milestones being accomplished at ESA facilities and those of their commercial partners. Upon review of these new concepts and technologies, some priorities become apparent. Looking to the next decade and beyond, the ESA is committed to ensuring independence in design, manufacture, and launch capabilities. They are also pursuing reusable rocket technology for both engines and launch vehicles, reducing the carbon footprint of spaceflight and servicing the commercial space sector (especially where constellations of small satellites are concerned). In-House Assembly SPECTRUM: This [two-stage orbital launch vehicle](https://www.isaraerospace.com/spectrum), developed by [Isar Aerospace](https://www.isaraerospace.com/), is specifically designed for small and medium satellites. The vehicle is manufactured at the Isar facility to allow for flexibility with the design and mission profiles. Spectrum has nine ISAR [Aquila engines](https://www.isaraerospace.com/press/aquila-engine-development) on its first stage and a single Aquila on its second. These engines rely on a combination of liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid propane fuel. The rocket can reportedly transport 1000 kg (2200 lbs) to LEO and 700 kg (~1545 lbs) to Sun-Synchronous Orbit (SSO). Space Rider: This reusable [uncrewed robotic laboratory](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/Space_Rider), currently being developed by the Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI), Switzerland, and the Portuguese Space Agency, will allow for technology demonstrations and research in pharmaceutics, biomedicine, biology, and physical science. It will be launched to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) using the new four-stage [Vega-C](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/Launch_vehicles/Vega-C), where it will remain for up to two months conducting experiments within its cargo bay. At the end of its mission, it will return to Earth and land on a runway to be refurbished for its next flight. MIURA-1: Next up is the [suborbital launch vehicle](https://www.pldspace.com/en/miura-1) fully designed and developed in-house by Spanish aerospace provider [PLD Space](https://www.pldspace.com/en/). Designed for microgravity research, this rocket can transport up to four experiments to space and return them to Earth, with a total payload capacity of 100 kg (220 lbs). The vehicle relies on a single [TEPREL-B](https://nachodevblog.com/posts/teprel-1b/) liquid bipropellant engine that burns kerosene and LOX propellant. RFA One: This 3-stage rocket is another launch vehicle entirely developed in-house by Austrian aerospace company [Rocket Factory Augsburg](https://www.rfa.space/). The first stage relies on nine [Helix ORSC](https://www.rfa.space/helix-public-names-rfa-engine/) engines optimized for sea level that rely on LOX and RP1 fuel and are equipped with thrust-vector control (TVC). The second stage relies on a single Helix Vac engine built in-house using additive manufacturing. The launch system also has a Redshift Orbital Transfer Vehicle (OTV) that ensures accurate delivery to the desired orbit, with payloads of 1300 kg (2866 lbs) to SSO and 300 kg (660 lbs) to a Lunar Transfer Orbit (LTO). Reusability Prometheus and Themis: Next up is the [Prometheus](https://www.ariane.group/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Prometheus_2020_05_DS_EN_Web.pdf) engine and [Themis launch stage](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/Themis), both courtesy of ArianeGroup. The former is being developed as part of an ESA program in collaboration with the French Space Agency (CNES) with support from the German Aerospace Agency (DLR). This low-cost, potentially reusable engine runs on LOX and liquid methane and will serve as a precursor for next-generation European launchers used in the post-2030 time frame. Similarly, Themis is an ESA rocket prototype and demonstrator that will test retrieval and reuse technologies. SUSIE: Short for [Smart Upper Stage for Innovative Exploration](https://www.ariane.group/en/news/susie-the-reusable-space-transporter-european-style/), SUSIE is a reusable upper stage concept capable of autonomously transporting cargo to LEO or performing crewed missions with up to 5 astronauts. ArianeGroup is currently developing the vehicle to be launched with the Ariane 6 rocket on future ESA missions. Propulsion M10 Engine: This engine is under development by a consortium led by the Italian space propulsion company [Avio](https://www.avio.com/who-we-are) with the help of commercial partners from Belgium, Czechia, Switzerland, France, Austria, and Romania. The M10 will be Europe’s first LOX/methane engine and stage that will help pave the way for next-generation launchers (like the [Vega-E](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/Launch_vehicles/Vega-E)), thus ensuring increased competitiveness by European small launchers. SL1: The [Small Launcher-1](https://www.hyimpulse.de/en/products/5-project-3-mini-launcher) is being developed by [HyImpulse](https://www.hyimpulse.de/en/), a German aerospace company specializing in hybrid propulsion. The three-stage smallsat launch vehicle is equipped with twelve hybrid rocket motors that rely on a combination of LOX and Paraffin wax, a low-cost option that allows for greater safety and flexible launch operations. The SL1 will be the first European launch vehicle capable of launching satellites with a payload of up to 500 kg (1100 lbs) to dedicated Earth orbits. Green Technology Orbex Prime: This [two-stage launch system](https://orbex.space/launch-vehicle) is the work of [Orbex](https://orbex.space), a UK-based orbital launch services company specializing in low-carbon, high-performance micro-launch vehicles. This two-stage micro-launcher is carbon-neutral, relying on bio-liquid natural gas (BioLPG) to power its seven engines. Most of its propulsion subsystem is built using additive manufacturing (3D printing), while the main structure and tanks are composed of carbon fiber/graphene composites. With a payload capacity of 180 kg (~400 lbs), this micro-launcher will service the growing small satellite (smallsat) market. XL: Developed by UK-based launch vehicle manufacturer [Skyrora](https://www.skyrora.com/), the [XL](https://www.skyrora.com/skyrora-xl/) is a three-stage, light-class launch vehicle intended to send payloads to SSO or Polar Orbit. Powering the first and second stages are nine and one Skyforce engines (respectively) that run on LOX and a kerosene fuel made from waste plastic ( [Ecosene](https://www.skyrora.com/ecosene/)). These concepts align with several emerging trends, cutting-edge technologies, and priorities that characterize the modern space age. In addition to reducing costs and increasing access to space, there is the growing role of commercial space and the need for collaboration between the public and private sectors. On top of that, there are significant concerns that so many launches per year will mean more emissions, thus significantly contributing to climate change – hence the need for carbon-neutral manufacturing and fuel options.

    "title": "‘Floating pool’ to open in NYC river in 2025",
    "text": "Who’s up for a dip in the East River? Or maybe the Hudson? After more than a decade of fits and starts, a floating pool that’s shaped like a plus sign is headed for one of New York City’s waterways this summer — though it won’t be open to the public until 2025, assuming tests go well. Once completed, the 9,000-square-foot pool, created by a crowdfunded company called +POOL, promises a chemical-free filtration system that takes in hundreds of thousands of gallons of river water and makes it more palatable to swimmers. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Mayor Eric Adams made the announcement Friday. They said a test version of the pool and its filtration system will be placed in a New York City waterway — exact location TBD — to ensure it meets state and city health guidelines. The state is pledging $12 million toward the effort, with the city chipping in another $4 million. “This was an invention that [makes it] possible to use our own waterways to find pools in communities who have historically been ignored,\" Adams said at the Children's Aid Dunlevy Milbank Community Center in Harlem. The pool idea has been — ahem — floated in New York City for years. The company, +POOL, launched [a Kickstarter campaign back in 2013](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/694835844/pool-tile-by-tile/description), raising more than $270,000 by promising to engrave donors’ names into tiles that will make up the pool and its deck. Then there was a fancy PR campaign in 2018, backed by Heineken, the beer brand. It featured [an eight-minute mini documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi9okFb6wvs) on the history of the company and floating pools — narrated by none other than Neil Patrick Harris – and was paired with a petition at a now-defunct website, SwimInTheRiver.com. In 2021, New York City gave a tentative green light to the project — known as a notice to proceed with due diligence — in the East River near Manhattan’s Two Bridges neighborhood, between the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan Bridge. But the exact location of the test facility or the final pool itself is now to be determined, according to the governor’s office. A press release from the mayor’s office didn’t specify a location either. Hochul, meanwhile, seems ready to take the concept statewide. The announcement Friday was part of a package of investments in swimming facilities, lifeguard training and learn-to-swim programs. Hochul pledged to put up $60 million in state funding for competitive grants to deploy floating pools in waterways across the state. “This is how you open up your rivers and waterways to the public,” she said. An earlier version of this story misstated the square footage of the proposed floating pool. It is 9,000 square feet.",
