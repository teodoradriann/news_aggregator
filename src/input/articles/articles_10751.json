    "text": "天氣日漸炎熱，各地普遍高溫悶熱，當在大熱天底下進行短時間的運動或者長久暴露於悶熱的環境裡，不論是待在室內或室外，如果沒有補充適當的水分和鹽分，產生身體機能失常，便可能發生熱傷害、熱衰竭或熱中暑。衛生福利部南投醫院醫師也提醒民眾，任何人都有可能發生熱傷害，盡量避免在「最熱的時段外出」，嚴重的話，恐導致器官損壞、急性腎衰竭，甚至危及性命。\n 衛福部南投醫院洪弘昌院長提醒，由於氣溫持續上升，動輒34到35度，民眾在戶外曝曬應特別注意，在無適當防護措施下，任何人都有可能發生熱傷害，嚴重的話恐導致器官損壞、急性腎衰竭甚至危及性命。建議民眾在戶外除了做好防曬措施，盡量避免在最熱的時段外出，也需補充足夠的水分。\n中醫科賴卉蓮醫師指出，平常飲食方面，在夏日可藉由吃西瓜、冬瓜、薏仁、蓮子、綠豆等清熱解暑的食物來解解暑氣。其中西瓜俗稱「天然白虎湯」，味甘性寒，具有清熱解暑、生津止渴等功效，但因其性寒，飲食宜適可而止，避免過食寒涼反而傷胃。\n除了飲食，刮痧也有清熱降暑的功能，賴卉蓮醫師表示，中暑症狀輕者，可以用刮痧板，或者邊緣鈍滑的銅錢、瓷匙等器具刮痧，在肩、頸部後側及上背部，進行反覆刮刷之動作，皮下出現紅色或紫色瘀斑即可。",

    "text": "Iron County welcomes Jay Sween as new manager\nBy PAMELA JANSSON\nHurley — The new manager of Iron County just began the position on Monday.\nJay Sween is the new county manager who was just hired by the Iron County Board of Supervisors on July 9.\n“Happy to be here,” said Sween after a Tuesday meeting of the board’s Finance Committee. “I couldn’t wait to move up here.”\nOriginally from Wausau, Wisconsin, Sween spent the last 12 years working in the Division of Motor Vehicles for the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.\nDuring that time, he said he worked largely as a section chief.\nWith Sween in the brand new county position, board supervisor Larry Youngs delivered his final report as an interim administrative coordinator.\nYoungs had assumed that role on July 1 after board member Roxanne Lutgen had taken on the role voluntarily for the first six months of the year.\n“My time was short and sweet,” said Youngs, who said he tapped other board members and county employees for support during his brief stint in the role.\nHe said he was happy now to turn over those responsibilities to Sween.\nIn other news, the committee also discussed county employees’ benefit options, following a recent benefit study presentation by Cottingham and Butler Insurance Services Inc. of Madison, Wisconsin.\n“This isn’t necessarily reducing any benefits, but it would increase the options available to employees,” said Mario Loreti regarding suggestions made by the company, which included various additional benefit options.\nFinance Committee chairman Kurt Wolff agreed.\nLoreti said choices such as high-deductible plans, which allow for lower premium costs, may be attractive to younger employees.\nYoungs and Lutgen also praised the company’s suggestion to offer long-term care benefits, with Youngs describing it as “huge,” and Lutgen saying it was “long overdue.”\nLutgen suggested that a discussion of whether to exchange the county’s current options for days off with a paid-time off system — often referred to as PTO days — should be encouraged during the next meeting of county department heads.\nShe said it also could be beneficial for the county to continue using the Madison company as county officials act on the benefits analysis and on a pending wage analysis.\n“It’s sort of like a broker,” she said in relation to how the company could help the county with its expertise and connections.\nWolff also said the county may wish to consider using the company’s services throughout next year.\n“I think it makes a lot of sense to have an expert on this,” he said.\nNo action was taken at Tuesday’s meeting.\nCommittee members also:\n— Approved the posting of a legal assistant position after learning that Richard Jenkins has resigned from that role, effective Aug. 10.\n— Heard that county clerk Christan Brandt had a successful meeting with all other town or city clerks within the county regarding procedural changes.\nAt the end of the meeting, members entered a closed session.\nBy BRIANNE COOK\nHurley — Members of the Hurley City Council learned at their latest meeting that Impact Seven has completed negotiations for public financing of its housing project and now expects to have an official groundbreaking ceremony on Sept. 12.\nClerk/treasurer Stacey Wiercinski reported the news at the July 15 meeting.\nThe project, which was cleared through the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority, is earmarked for 13 to 14 acres off of Wisconsin 77, across from the Cary Mine Market.\nWith the blessing of Iron County and the Hurley City Council, the project is a collaboration between Impact Seven, a nonprofit entity that invests in community development, and Northwood Technical College. They are both based in Rice Lake, Wisconsin.\nThe multimillion dollar project is expected to include an onsite classroom, along with as many as 40 housing units of varying sizes and other amenities.\nThe project has been on the horizon since early 2024 and already underwent delays due to the need to address wetland issues.\nIn other news, Scott Santini, director of public works, advised milling and repaving a segment of 5th Avenue while road crews work nearby on U.S. 51.\nWith equipment and crews already present in the area, he said the city would incur no associated deployment cost.\nSantini estimated the cost of the street repairs at $17,000 and committed to getting bids for the work. Council took no action on the issue.\nSantini also reported that work on 3rd Avenue water lines is expected to be done soon despite having encountered multiple setbacks.\nCouncil members also:\n— Learned from Hurley Police Chief Chris Colassaco that Joseph Hallihan has been hired as a full-time officer working the night shift. The department now has a part-time position open after former Officer Cole Miller resigned as of July 9.\n— Learned that Flock Safety cameras will be installed in either August or September. These street cameras record images of license plates and other vehicle details and store the information so that law enforcement officials can access it online if needed.\n— Learned that Scott Sternhagen of CliftonLarsonAllen’s office in Green Bay, Wisconsin, has advised that a 3% simplified rate increase for sewer services will need to be implemented in March 2026.\n— Approved Colleen Sachs to be appointed to the Planning and Zoning committee.\n— Approved a structure at 400 Poplar St. to be razed, following a structure fire there.\n— Approved and referred to the Planning and Zoning Committee an application from Bruce Czarnecki to construct a garage of 30 feet by 50 feet by 17 feet at 227 Cary Road.\n— Approved the creation of a description for a recycling attendant job position, which is needed to get reimbursement from the county for someone that Hurley already employs.\nDuring public comment, Hurley resident Jean Ninefeldt requested that the annual Giving Tree project organized by Northern Iron County Engaged Residents be held indoors in order to reduce the potential for unintended litter.\nUntil now, the project has invited local citizens to pick up index cards on a tree and then donate Christmas gifts to children listed on the cards. Ninefeldt said that she is still picking up cards hung last year.\nCity clerk/treasurer Stacey Wiercinski said that the city already has communicated with NICER members about the issue.\nThe council’s next regular meeting will be on Aug. 12 at 5 p.m. in City Hall.",

    "text": "US court blocks Coach owner's $8.5 bn buyout of Versace parent\nPAY ATTENTION: Flexible Payment Plans Available! Invest in Yourself & See the Return with Our Affordable Copywriting Course!\nA US judge on Thursday blocked fashion group Tapestry's $8.5 billion deal to buy Capri, which owns luxury brands including Michael Kors and Versace, citing a potential loss of competition.\nThe deal, seen as an attempt to create a new global fashion giant to compete with European powerhouses, was halted by a court in New York after the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued to prevent it earlier this year.\n\"The Court finds that the merging parties are close competitors, such that the merger would result in the loss of head-to-head competition,\" court documents read, after seven days of testimony.\nTapestry owns brands including Coach and Kate Spade.\nAmong concerns were that the companies could have an incentive to reduce discounts and increase prices if the merger went through.\nThe ruling is seen as a victory for the FTC, an independent agency whose current chair was appointed by President Joe Biden.\nIt also comes ahead of the US presidential election on November 5, in which heightened costs of living have been a key voter concern.\nAntitrust action\nBoth the FTC and the Department of Justice's antitrust division have ramped up action against corporate mergers in recent years.\nCapri shares plunged by around 50 percent in after hours trading.\nTapestry shares were up by more than 11 percent.\nIn court documents Thursday, the companies argued that the ruling effectively blocks the merger permanently.\nThe takeover had aimed to boost sales by combining customer data streams, broadening geographic reach and achieving some $200 million in annual cost savings within three years of the deal closing, the two companies said last year.\nThe acquisition would have given Tapestry an upscale portfolio with multiple brands focused on shoes and handbags, as well as a strengthened apparel offering with Versace and Kors, a celebrity favorite.\nTapestry and Capri did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nIn pushing to block the deal this year, the FTC argued the proposed merger threatened to \"deprive millions of American consumers of the benefits of Tapestry and Capri's head-to-head competition.\"\nEarlier this year, JetBlue and Spirit Airlines pulled the plug on a merger weeks after a federal judge ruled that it violated US antitrust law.\nAt the time, Biden lauded the decision, saying the merger would have forced higher fares and fewer choices on US consumers, calling it a success that his administration blocked it.\nSource: AFP\nAFP AFP text, photo, graphic, audio or video material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium.

    "text": "By Field Level Media ,\n2 hours ago\nHall of Famer Dwyane Wade had surgery to remove a cancerous tumor from his right kidney in December 2023, he revealed during his podcast published on Thursday.\nWade, who turned 43 on Jan. 17, made his first public comments on the health issue on “The Why with Dwyane Wade” while speaking with podcast co-host Bob Metelus.\nAfter noticing changes in his urination, which had gotten slower and weaker, Wade went to see a doctor.\nDwyane Wade revealed on his podcast that he had surgery to remove a cancerous tumor. The Why with Dwyane Wade “Because I did the full body scan, they were able to see my entire body, my entire insides, and they were able to see something that was on my kidney,” he said.\nGabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade just bought a chic beach house on Long Island — and, no, not in the Hamptons\nWade said doctors saw a possible cyst or tumor and said that surgery would be needed because the area could not be biopsied. He got multiple medical opinions to confirm the diagnosis.\n“I had a personal decision to make, and what it was was, ‘If this is cancerous, if this tumor, this cyst is cancerous, on your kidney, you’re 41 years old, you probably need surgery because it’s something that needs to be removed so it doesn’t spread,’ ” Wade said.\nDoctors removed 40 percent of his right kidney, he said.\nDwyane Wade statue creator breaks silence after immense criticism\n“Thank God that I did the surgery, right, because the tumor was cancerous,” Wade said.\nHe called it one of the most vulnerable moments in his life.\n“I think it was the first time my family, my dad, my kids, they saw me weak,” Wade said. “That moment was probably the weakest point I’ve ever felt in my life. The moments that I was by myself, I was struggling, dog.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR STARTING LINEUP NEWSLETTER\n“As a man, you never want your family to see you weak. Don’t want to be perceived weak, and you don’t want to be seen in your weak moments, right? But I had to.”\nHis family’s support throughout was especially important to him.\n“In that process of my weakness, I found strength in my family.”\nWade was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2023.\nThe fifth overall pick in 2003 out of Marquette, the guard played 16 seasons in the NBA, including 14-plus seasons over two stints with the Miami Heat, winning league titles in 2006, 2012 and 2013. He also played for the Chicago Bulls (2016-17) and Cleveland Cavaliers (2017-18).\nThe 13-time All-Star averaged 22.0 points, 5.4 assists, 4.7 rebounds and 1.5 steals while shooting 48 percent from the field.\nFor the latest in sports, top headlines, breaking news and more, visit nypost.com/sports/",

    "text": "快科技6月11日消息，近日，浙江交警公布了一起令人瞠目结舌的违法案例。\n6月3日清晨，罗某与亲友一行4人，驾车从湖北老家出发，踏上了前往杭州上班的旅程。\n当天下午1点30分许，当车辆从杭新景高速驶入杭州境内不久， 她们发现从老家带回杭州的鸡和鸭一动不动。\n罗某怕车上的鸡鸭死在半路上，辜负了长辈的心意，竟直接停在了应急车道上。\n随后，车上几人竟在应急车道上旁若无人地开始了杀鸡宰鸭的“操作”。 他们或许以为只是短暂处理一下，不会有什么大问题，却全然忽略了自身行为所带来的严重安全隐患。\n杭州高速交警通过公共视频巡查到她们，立即通知附近巡逻警力火速赶往现场，并将她们安全带离高速。\n罗某解释说：“从老家带来几只鸡鸭，眼看半路上不行了，我们打算拿那个刀片先放下血，然后等回杭州去处理，我们知道错了。”\n了解情况后，现场交警对罗某一行人进行了严肃的宣传教育，也依法对其违法行为进行了处罚。\n这起事件也给广大驾驶员敲响了警钟：高速公路上的应急车道是生命通道，不能随意占用，更不能在车道上进行如此危险且违规的行为。\n【本文结束】如需转载请务必注明出处：快科技\n责任编辑：随心",
