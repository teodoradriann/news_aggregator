    "text": "Austria confirms agreement with Bulgaria and Romania on air and sea entry into Schengen – reports Austria has confirmed the agreement with Bulgaria and Romania on the inclusion of the two countries’ air and sea ports in the Schengen zone, Bulgarian National Television (BNT) reported on December 30, citing the Austrian Interior Ministry. The text of the agreement was sent to the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the European Union on the night of December 29, the ministry said, according to BNT. The earliest possible entry date is March 2024, Austrian media said. The agreement means that travellers from Romania and Bulgaria will in future not be subject to border controls when flying to other European Union countries, the report said. As usual, though not passing through passport control, the identity document will be checked at the gate by the airline with additional support from the Austrian and Romanian or Bulgarian police. According to the Austrian Interior Ministry, no negotiations are currently underway regarding the inclusion of Bulgaria’s and Romania’s land borders and thus full accession to Schengen. Austrian newspaper Kurier said that all three demands by Vienna had been taken into account, according to a report by Bulgarian National Radio (BNR). These are increasing the presence of Frontex in Bulgaria and Romania, more funds from the European Commission for the stable protection of the external borders, strengthening the control of the land borders and for Bulgaria and Romania to accept asylum seekers, especially from Afghanistan and Syria, that seek asylum in Austria. Bulgaria’s government told a BNR that it would not comment on the subject of the phased admission of Bulgaria and Romania to Schengen until the negotiations with Austria are completed and while no binding legal document has been approved. Austria has been the sole remaining member of the Schengen zone not to have given its consent to the admission of Bulgaria and Romania to the zone, after Parliament in the Netherlands [gave its consent on December 21](https://sofiaglobe.com/2023/12/22/parliament-in-the-netherlands-votes-in-favour-of-bulgarias-admission-to-schengen-report/).

    "text": "In the world of IoT (Internet of Things), Raspberry Pi is a quite popular gadget due to its reliability and cost-effectiveness. A most common issue that users encounter is establishing a secure and direct connection between these devices. This is where IoT P2P (Peer-to-Peer) and IoT VPC Networks become useful.\nUnderstanding VPC\nA Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is like a private room on the internet. It’s easy to set up and users can connect many devices like Raspberry Pi or other Internet of Things (IoT) devices to it from anywhere. It feels these devices are part of user’s local network. This is possible only because of a service called RemoteIoT. It helps create these private rooms on the internet. So, these devices can connect securely as if they’re in the same room. This is useful for controlling these devices remotely or sharing data between them securely. It’s like having a piece of the internet just for these devices, making remote connectivity simpler and more secure.\nUnderstanding the Principle\nThe working principle of RemoteIoT VPC is simple. It allows users to organize their devices into logical groups or enhance their public interface.\nDevice Segregation\nUsers can use RemoteIoT VPC to separate their devices into logical groups. This helps in managing the devices more efficiently.\nStrengthening Public Interface\nWhile allowing access from other devices in the same VPC, users can strengthen their public interface. This ensures a secure connection between the devices.\nPrivate Backend Tasks\nThe most significant advantage is that users can carry out backups, replication, and other backend tasks privately. This means their traffic is not exposed to the public internet, ensuring a secure environment for their operations.\nCreating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)\nCreating a IoT VPC Network involves a few steps. First, navigate to the VPC Networks page in the cloud console. Click on the “Add VPC Network” button to start the process. A form appears requesting the network name, which should represent the VPC’s purpose.\nNext, configure the IP range. users can accept an automatic IP range or manually configure it for more control over the network’s structure. Then, select a group for the VPC to determine its access permissions and security settings.\nFinally, click the “Submit” button to create the VPC. The system establishes the new VPC, which is then ready for use and can be managed from the VPC Networks page. This process is crucial for setting up a secure and efficient cloud environment.\nAccessing Devices in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Network\nEstablishing the IoT VPC Network\nAfter the creation of a VPC, it’s time to access the devices within this network. The VPC, once established, provides a secure environment for these devices.\nLogging into Devices\nUsers can log into any device within the VPC. This is typically done using a secure shell (SSH) or remote desktop protocol (RDP), depending on the device’s operating system.\nUsing the ifconfig Command\nUpon successful login, users can input the ifconfig command in the terminal. This command displays the network configuration of the device, including its IP address within the VPC.\nEstablishing a Virtual Network\nThe execution of the ifconfig command effectively establishes a virtual network. This network exists within the confines of the VPC, providing an additional layer of security and control.\nAccessing Other Devices\nWith the virtual network in place, users can access other devices within the VPC. This is done using either the IP address of the target device or its name. This allows for efficient navigation and operation within the VPC network.\nUnderstanding Firewall Settings in RemoteIoT VPC Networks\nRemoteIoT VPC Networks operate on a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) direct communication infrastructure. This setup allows devices within the network to communicate directly with each other, enhancing efficiency and reducing latency.\nHowever, this P2P communication necessitates specific firewall settings. Specifically, the user’s firewall must be configured to allow the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for outbound messages. UDP is a core communication protocol used in P2P networks, known for its speed and efficiency.\nThe firewall acts as a security barrier, controlling network traffic to and from devices within the VPC. By permitting UDP for outbound messages, the firewall allows devices in the VPC to communicate freely with each other, while still providing a level of security against potential threats.\nIn Conclusion\nTo Directly Connect Raspberry Pi with p2p (Peer-to-Peer) and Internet of Things using Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Networks presents a robust and direct approach to managing IoT devices. This method offers a private network system that is not only secure but also straightforward to establish and operate. It’s an optimal solution for those seeking to augment their IoT configurations. By leveraging this setup, users can enjoy enhanced control and security over their IoT devices, making it a highly recommended strategy for anyone involved in the IoT space.\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: REMOTEIOT INC.\nContact Person: Media Relations\nEmail: Send Email\nPhone: +1 866 516 0608\nCountry: United States\nWebsite: https://remoteiot.com",

    "text": "[To news overview](/f1-news)© XPBimages Mercedes driver George Russell has hailed a new-for-this-season safety innovation introduced by the FIA into F1, despite issues associated with the device's target causing problems during practice for the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. A number of drivers escaped with near-misses as traffic caused chaos on Thursday, particularly in second practice, with Russell's teammate Lewis Hamilton warned and Mercedes fined for almost causing a collision with Williams' Logan Sargeant. Russell himself was almost forced into the wall on the run to the final corner later in the session as RB driver Yuki Tsunoda suffocated the space on the inside of the track with drivers jostling for track position. Viewed by others: 'Really big improvement' Asked about the issue, Grand Prix Drivers' Association director Russell explained a new system introduced by the FIA for this year. \"It's always difficult in Jeddah,\" said the Briton. \"You can't have it all because it is one of the best circuits to drive, so exhilarating, but you can't see. \"It's definitely challenging. The FIA at the start of this year introduced something on our steering wheel to show us the car in front and the car behind and the gaps, which has been a really big improvement. \"But the thing is, if you have two cars behind on a slow lap, you might have a car travelling at 200mph, 10 seconds behind, and he passes through - that's kind of what happened with Lewis and Sargeant - you don't know who is three or four cars behind on a push lap. \"But definitely a real improvement on safety in that regard.\" Don't miss out on any of the F1 action thanks to this handy 2024 F1 calendar that can be easily loaded into your smartphone or PC.

    "title": "This Just In: Drop The Ball Already",
    "text": "This Just In – I’m beyond ready. Please … drop the ball on 2023.\nIn 2012, the Obama-Biden campaign was not looking like an easy re-elect, but then Joe Biden said something that was a bumper sticker summary of what the administration had accomplished. “Bin Laden is Dead. GM is alive,” he said.\nShort. Simple. Memorable. Factual. Those were the days.\nAt this point in the presidential election cycle, my summation of the campaigns and coverage would be something like this: Trump-91. Biden-81.\nI’ve been hearing from friends and pundits alike the cynical “he gets away with everything” angst about Trump that is baked into any speculation about 2024’s campaigns and possible outcome.\nFor example, when the Colorado case lands at the Supreme Court, these folks point to Trump’s having put three of the nine justices on the bench. I guess that means they’ll act as supporters and throw cases in his favor, right?\nIn the dozens of challenges that escalated to the Court after the 2020 election, Trump prevailed in zero cases. He has attempted repeatedly to assert Executive and Presidential Privilege arguments to get some of these prosecutions thrown out altogether. They have failed and failed and failed. They have, however, produced delays, which is the objective.\nLike a sugar-hyped kid arguing to stay up later at bedtime, Trump is throwing everything up against the wall to prevent what he knows is coming. Thrashing in every direction, threatening everyone he’s allowed to threaten, he is generating a machine of harassment and danger for public servants who do not deserve it.\nThe polls suggest that with a recession avoided, economy growing at a sustainable pace, manufacturing growing, wages and workers’ power surging like gangbusters and extremely tricky foreign policy being navigated expertly, the main thing I should know and worry about is that Biden is 81 years old … as are Paul McCartney, Harrison Ford and Barbra Streisand.\nPersonally, I think the real message of the “Biden is old” argument has everything to do with a healthy, capable 59-year-old black woman standing by in case anything happens to the president. This is my own cynicism, to be sure, but yeah, I’ll bet on racism and misogyny every time to explain the otherwise unexplainable.\nAfter all, Biden’s political argument is the tried and true “finish the job” pitch that every first term president uses. Trump’s platform is about hating immigrants and locking up anyone who crossed him, abusing presidential power and almost certainly relieving all of us of the burden of voting to decide who the next president should be.\nHis assertions that the ’24 election will not be free or fair have already begun and he will certainly be calling for demonstrations and violence to disrupt an orderly election process. This is expected now.\nIn just a few weeks, we’ll begin seeing footage day after day of the former president marching into a federal courthouse. The campaign will be about his “I’m being treated unfairly” whining, not about us. Not about a vision for the country, not about security or economic growth.\nThroughout the year, there are going to be even more civil and criminal instances of accountability being delivered to the 45th president, starting with a giant civil decision in New York that will end his business activity there. That case, brought by New York Attorney General Tish James, as been a sleeping giant for its potential impact.\nThere, too, is an instance of a strong Black woman who stands in opposition to Trump. His response has been, in part, to repeatedly refer to her as “Peek-a-boo James,” a racist dog-whistle term. Similarly, he refers to Atlanta District Attorney Fani Willis (who is prosecuting him on RICO charges) using animal references in order to dehumanize her.\nIt’s a dangerous time, but the Hitler-admiring 45th President of the United States is thrashing about because that ball is going to drop at midnight on Sunday and the year of reckoning will be here.\nJean Bolduc is a freelance writer and the host of the Weekend Watercooler on 97.9 The Hill.

    "text": "Bethlehem Township has cited 18 reasons for rejecting a warehouse proposed for Freemansburg Avenue, among them noise and a limited traffic study, two issues cited by many residents.\nDallas-based Trammell Crow has proposed an 866,350-square-foot warehouse for 1600 Freemansburg Ave., a property that straddles the border of the township and the Borough of Freemansburg.\nThe township Board of Commissioners voted 5-0 on Jan. 15 to reject the plan.\nAt that meeting, Commissioner Michael Hudak said that legal action might follow the rejection, but he said the public does not want a warehouse on the already busy road.\nThe property was once a quarry and is now used as a dump.\nThe township is obligated to respond with a formal letter within 10 days of the rejection of a plan.\nTrammell Crow declined to comment.\n69 News has contacted Catherine Durso, an Allentown attorney representing the company, for comment.\nIn addition to noise and the limits of traffic study, the rejection letter includes notes about environmental concerns, including vehicles leaking fluids; potential threats to public health, including toxic substances, traffic hazards and pollution, and the failure to provide a \"tree study.\"\nThe township letter also includes a note about lack of tree plantings, and a failure to provide evidence of berms that meet zoning standards. There are also comments about failure to provide evidence for access for fire trucks, a lack of storm sewer calculations, and other shortcomings.\nBethlehem Township residents have attended a series of public hearings on the plan to object, with some claiming additional traffic on Freemansburg Avenue would put lives at risk.\nTrammell Crow is also developing two warehouses on the site of the former Dutch Springs water park in Lower Nazareth Township and Bethlehem Township.\nTrammell Crow is a division of CBRE Group, the world's biggest commercial real estate firm. In fiscal 2022, CBRE's revenue was $30.8 billion.\nShares in CBRE Group are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CBRE. At 3:37 p.m. Thursday, the share price was $86.74, giving the company a market capitalization (share price times number of shares outstanding) of $26.4 billion.\nScroll down for comments if available\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp LinkedIn SMS Email Print Copy article link Save",
