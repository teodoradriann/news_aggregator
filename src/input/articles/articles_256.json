    "text": "Richard Branson To Pilot $125,000-a-Trip Space Balloon With ‘Cocktail Service’\nThe entire experience is projected to last six hours, reaching more the 100,000 feet into the sky.\nIn a move set to redefine space tourism, Sir Richard Branson will co-pilot the inaugural crewed flight of Space Perspective’s innovative stratospheric balloon, ascending to 20 miles above Earth.\nSpace Perspective, the company behind the ambitious venture, made headlines with a successful, uncrewed flight in September. The upcoming mission aims to set a new milestone by floating a capsule “at levels above the atmosphere never before achieved in a commercial balloon flight,” according to the company.\nMr. Branson, founder of Virgin Atlantic and renowned for his record-breaking balloon journeys across the Atlantic and Pacific in the late 1980s and early 1990s, is investing in this cutting-edge project. The venture has already secured $100 million in funding, underscoring its potential.\n“Some of the most magnificent experiences of my life have happened on ballooning expeditions and I’m excited to support Space Perspective in its journey,” he said, according to the Sun. “I’m passionate about adventure and helping fellow entrepreneurs reach their business dreams. I look forward to dusting off my old ballooning license ahead of some magnificent test flights.”\nThe hydrogen-powered capsule promises a gentle ascent into space, culminating in an ocean splashdown. The entire experience is projected to last six hours, reaching more the 100,000 feet into the sky, “the highest altitude of any commercial balloon flight in the world.”\nNotably, the flight eschews traditional space travel elements such as rockets and zero-gravity experiences. Space Perspective assures potential passengers that the flight is “as easy as an airplane flight,” requiring no heavy g-forces or specialized training.\nWhile enjoying a “world-class meal and cocktail service,” passengers can also stay connected via onboard Wi-Fi, the company said. Yet the highlight remains the breathtaking view of Earth through “the largest windows ever to adorn a pressurised capsule,” offering an unparalleled perspective on Earth.",

    "title": "University of Kent students denied lectures as staff goes on strike over redundancy fears - Kent Live",
    "text": "Students at the University of Kent have seen their lectures getting cancelled as staff members have planned to go on strike this week over the threat of future redundancies. The University of Kent, which has campuses in Canterbury and Medway, has been involved in financial problems for years.\nThe institution issued \"at risk of redundancy\" notices to 58 staff, while 40 others had taken voluntary redundancy, it was revealed in February last year. Moreover, the institution abolished courses – axing programmes in anthropology, art history, health and social care, journalism, music and audio technology, and philosophy.\nThe decision provoked protests at the university's Canterbury campus. And, as a result, Karen Cox, who had led the university as vice-chancellor since 2017, resigned.\nThe university ran a voluntary redudancy scheme and leaving roles unfilled in a desperate bid to save £19.5 million, at the start of this year. Nevertheless, the institution's staff who are members of the University and College Union (UCU) voted in favour of going on strike throughout this week.\nUCU revealed in a statement: \"The university has found itself in a regular cycle of cuts to staff, courses and restructures, all of which impact the livelihoods and workloads of staff who work tirelessly to support students, conduct outstanding research and scholarship, and keep the university going. Staff are taking action after the employer refused to rule out compulsory redundancies or provide guarantees that staff will not suffer detriment to their workload or working conditions.\n\"In negotiations this year, management extended a promise of no compulsory redundancies to academic teaching staff until December 2025. However, they could not guarantee the same for professional services staff (such as student support, marketing, and library services), some of whom are also UCU members.\"\nOn Monday, the Parliament of Kent Students' Union (KSU) reportedly voted \"overwhelmingly\" to support the strikes according to KSU president Lulu Collins. She noted: \"There are many opinions among students though.\"\nLulu continued: \"A lot of students aren't fully au fait with why UCU are striking – there's no real communication between the UCU and students.\" Many of the staff striking will also be postgraduate students who work as teaching assistants – who are also members of KSU.\nThe KSU president further revealed: \"The changes that the UCU are struggling with – the restructuring, etc – students just don't feel in the know about it.\" Lulu also stated that as with some previous strikes, it is possible the university will run a scheme to compensate students for lost teaching time during the industrial action, but this is not guaranteed.\nIt has been reported that any savings the university makes due to the strikes cannot be kept by the institution itself. This means that that the money will be used for individual financial compensation for students. It can also go to hardship funds or a mix of both the financial compensation and the funds, depending on the impact of the strikes.\nLulu said: \"About 70% of universities are facing financial deficits this year, a lot of the sector is really unstable, and that means that conflicts like this I think are more likely to occur. At the end of the day, the uni has so many resources and UCU has a strong mandate so it can only move forward by talking to find a solution that's sustainable.\n\"For our students' and staff's sake I hope that happens soon.\" The University of Kent has almost 19,000 students and more than 4,500 staff – of which 1,200 are academic staff, the institution reveals.\nA spokesperson for the university shared: \"Despite constructive negotiations last week, some staff who are University and College Union members are taking five days of strike action from today. Under our Redundancy Avoidance Agreement with the Union, when we need to make staff savings, we ensure we explore all options to avoid the need for compulsory redundancies which are only ever a last resort.\n\"As we continue to work through these options with UCU, we are disappointed to see strike action and are open to continued talks to try and resolve their concerns. In the meantime we have plans in place to ensure any impact on our students is minimised as far as possible.\"\nGet more news from KentLive straight to your inbox for free HERE.",

    "title": "Cómo aprovechar las milagrosas propiedades energéticas de la avena",
    "text": "Tiene muchas propiedades para la salud: la avena es fuente de nutrientes y proteínas, además de poseer alto contenido en fibras que contribuyen a bajar el colesterol y estabilizar los niveles de azúcar en sangre. Aporta también carbohidratos y vitaminas B y E y minerales como el potasio, calcio, hierro y zinc. Pero la avena, este cereal tan versátil que consumimos desde la infancia y suele incorporarse a lo largo de la vida en desayunos energéticos, también es muy valorado en algunas prácticas de magia blanca. Símbolo por excelencia de la producción y la abundancia que nos brinda la Tierra, se cree que, al igual que el trigo , en el universo esotérico posee extraordinarios beneficios. Aquí te contamos las misteriosas propiedades energéticas de la avena. El uso de la avena es frecuente para elaborar recetas de cocina, pero también forma parte de cientos de fórmulas de productos cosméticos para cuidar y revitalizar la piel y el cabello. Desde mascarillas para reducir la inflamación, combatir la sequedad de la piel y remover impurezas del rostro hasta como un recurso para suavizar el cuero cabelludo y nutrir el cabello. También son conocidas las virtudes del agua de avena, en especial para depurar el aparato digestivo y fortalecer el sistema inmunológico . Desde hace siglos y en muchas culturas, además, tanto a la avena como a otros cereales y granos se les rinde tributo para obtener buenos resultados en las cosechas. Ceres (de ahí proviene el término cereal), la diosa romana que regía la agricultura, o Démeter, “madre distribuidora”, su equivalente para los griegos, era la encargada de garantizar la fertilidad y a quien estos pueblos apelaba en tiempos de hambre o rendimientos pobres de la Madre Tierra . Es por eso que a la avena se le atribuyen propiedades energéticas y se la incluye en ceremonias de prosperidad y abundancia como fuente de vitalidad, ánimo y fortaleza para enfrentar nuevos objetivos. Además, se cree que posee capacidad de absorber energía negativa y purificar el ambiente. Por eso, es ideal para colocar en empresas o negocios y a traer buena suerte, estabilidad económica y éxito financiero. Sus poderes se asocian también con la fertilidad y el amor. Es por eso que se utiliza además para atraer a una persona, fortalecer una relación existente y, también, para recibir buenas noticias en la búsqueda de un embarazo. Tanto el hogar como el ámbito laboral, la avena se puede usar para atraer el flujo positivo del Universo . Su potencia será aún más efectiva si se la combina con otros elementos a los que también se apela en busca de abundancia, por ejemplo, con cáscara de naranja u otros cereales y semillas como el trigo o las lentejas. Como recurso de protección se deben colocar todos los ingredientes en platitos pequeños y distribuirlos en distintos rincones. Para rituales de limpieza espiritual, la avena debe ser esparcida en pequeños puñados alrededor de un espacio, pero también se puede sumar al agua para un baño de purificación. Si se le agrega miel, además, la piel quedará suave como la de un bebé. Como amuleto, se puede colocar en una bolsita o dentro de un pañuelo y llevar en la cartera o el bolsillo. También en saquitos de protección servirán para trazar los círculos que delimiten el espacio sagrado en rituales y hechizos. Es decir, que con su poder separen el mundo espiritual del físico. Tanto para conseguirlo como para mejorar la energía en el grupo laboral o conseguir un ascenso, este ritual puede ser muy efectivo por las propiedades energéticas de la avena: Qué se necesita:\nCómo hacerlo:",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#18](c18#c-18) Todos hemos tenido 15 años y no nos hemos fugado de casa para unirnos a un ejército terrorista religioso radical.\nQue no estamos hablando de una borrachera o de suspender en clase. Con 15 años sabes de sobra que matar y torturar a otros está mal.\n[#53](c53#c-53) menos mal que a diferencia de las leyes británicas la Constitución Española la redactaron \"buenistas\" y no los \"hijoputistas\"\nArtículo 11.\nLa nacionalidad española se adquiere, se conserva y se pierde de acuerdo con lo establecido por la ley. Ningún español de origen podrá ser privado de su nacionalidad.\nCC\n[#50](c50#c-50)\n[#62](c62#c-62) Eso no quiere decir que no puedas perder la nacionalidad. Lo que dice la constitución es que como castigo o cuqluier otra cosa, te quiten la nacionalidad.\nPero si que puedes perderla. Si te vas a otro país y te nacionalizas de ese país, pierdes la nacionalidad española. Luego puedes recuperarla claro, pero tendrías que renunciar a la otra nacionalidad y realizar ciertos trámites. No te la quitan, pero si puedes perderla.\n[#18](c18#c-18) [#52](c52#c-52) Eso pense yo al principio, pero destacar que se reafirmo 4 años despues en una entrevista, defendiendo el ISIS y justificando los ataques terroristas. En ese punto ya tendria como 19 años. A mi me da la impresion de que el arrepentimiento le viene cuando los Kurdos la detuvieron y metieron en la carcel.\n[#71](c71#c-71) vaya, entonces debería volver al RU y e ir a la cárcel de allí.\nLo de quitar nacionalidades, lo veo como un arma que puede acabar disparando por cualquier lado equivocado... Especialmente si nació allí\n[#52](c52#c-52) Comer la cabeza se la puede comer a cualquiera sea con 15, 20 o 30. Pero no puedes demostrarlo realmente.\nTomo su decision, es lo que toca. No deja de ser una terrorista.\nLa reinsercion.. me encantaria ver cifras de cuantos presos realmente se reinsertan en la sociedad por tipo de delito.\nCreer en la reinserción ha permitido a asesinos volver a matar al salir, violar al volver a salir, robar al de nuevo, y algunos multiples veces, cada vez que los sueltan cada x años.\nLa cruda realidad es que no todo el mundo puede ser reinsertado en la sociedad, y la sociedad no tiene por que padecer por culpa de ellos.\n[#81](c81#c-81) A quien no es reinsertable? Simplemente no lo libero en su vida y punto. Pero liberar a alguien que se sabe que volvera a dañar a otra persona es demencial.\nTu soltarias a alguien que ha violado a alguien cada vez que lo sueltan? y lleva media docena de violaciones asi a su espalda?\nY si hablamos de quienes se van con isis, etc.. pues no es que los mande a otro pais, es que no les dejo volver y punto.\n[#84](c84#c-84) vale, yo no hablo de reinsertarla. Que lo mencioné porque no sabía el transfondo, si es reinsertable o no, ya lo decide algún especialista.\nY lo de quitar la nacionalidad, qué decir. Con cuidado de definir bien esas líneas. Luego tendrás a quién vaya a luchar en Ucrania o Israel, o alguna otra cosa afín, y pedirán el mismo trato.\n[#89](c89#c-89) El problema es que ningún especialista hace eso. Cumplen su condena y a la calle, punto. Y asi pasa lo que pasa.\nSi un ciudadano va a combatir junto a un grupo terrorista, no es lo mismo que unirse al ejercito de otro pais a combatir.\nPor otro lado, si comente crímenes de guerra, es obvio que deben ser juzgados y condenados.\nUcrania o israel no se consideran de momento grupos terroristas. En el momento que tengan dicha consideracion, pues si, deberan ser tratados igual que cualquiera que se uniera al ISIS por ejemplo\n[#18](c18#c-18) Si, pero ¿Te puedes fiar de ella ahora? Si se puediese tener la certeza al 100% de que fue una estupidez de adolescente que se le.paso por completo y que ya no sie te ninguna simpatía hacia las ideologías extremistas, deberían devolverle la ciudadanía.\nPero no hay forma de saberlo, y devolvérsela puede ser meter al enemigo en casa.\nYo tampoco correría el riesgo, prefiero que ella tenga que asumir las consecuencias de sus actos a que por confiar sea otro el que resulte lastimado.\n[#30](c30#c-30) No veo porque. Ya sea el estado o cualquier otro tipo de colectivo, si no cumples las normas mínimas de convivencia, pues a la calle.\n[#2](c2#c-2) ya lo podríamos hacer con los españoles y españolas que se van a Israel a hacer el servicio militar y si además han participado en Gaza acusarles de asesinato, genocidio y crímenes de guerra.\n[#2](c2#c-2) “Que le den por saco, por unirse a una banda terrorista.” — Dijo Cherenkov con la bandera palestina de avatar.\n[#2](c2#c-2) sí.\nLo que sí muchos se unen a las organizaciones terroristas más grandes y dañinas de las últimas décadas, y no pasa nada...\nCIA (ésta es la peor, incluso entrenó, apoyó y creó varias organizaciones terroristas), ejército israelí, OTAN, ejércitos de RU, etc...\nPero, claro, sólo se es terrorista, para \"occidente\", si el objetivo son países de \"occidente\"... pero cuando el objetivo son países no de \"occidente\" o cuando los perpetradores son de \"occidente\", entonces no pasa nada y son héroes.\nLa famosa hipocrecía \"occidental\"...\n[#3](c3#c-3) Con 15 años no eres responsable y consciente de tus actos, pero si ves mierda de perro en una acera si eres consiente y responsable para saber que eso no se come, o sea, esos \"menores\" son menores para unas cosas y para otras no\".\nEn España, a principio del siglo XX, mucha gente a los 15 años ya estaba casada y todo, era gente adulta... pero ahora es menor.\n[#4](c4#c-4) Sí, pero... ¿y si la mierda la han pintado de colores y luego le han puesto purpurina por encima?\n[#3](c3#c-3) Bueno, al parecer la tipa una vez mayor de edad se dedicaba a recaudar fondos para el Estado Islámico y\n\"Shamima se casó con un combatiente del Estado Islámico y tuvo tres hijos, todos los cuales murieron.\"\nLa BBC rastreó a Shamima después de recibir un aviso sobre una cuenta de redes sociales que estaba usando. El medio británicotambién dijo que encontró pruebas de que estaba recaudando fondos en línea para miembros del EI, lo cual es ilegal.\nun periodista la contactó después de que escapase de la prisión Camp Hol de Siria para mujeres que estaban con el grupo terrorista y sus hijos.\nDurante dichos intercambios, Shamima despidió a su ex amiga por “vivir de los beneficios” y se burló de ella como una fracasada y una no creyente.\nUn ex miembro de la organización terrorista le dijo a la BBC que la joven era fanática incluso para los estándares del Estado Islámico.\nhttps://www.larazon.es/internacional/shamima-begum-novia-yihad-britanica-que-indigno-pais-creyente-segun-amigo-que-inspiro-unirse-estado-islamico_20230322641b5d82079ac90001803bb2.html\n[#6](c6#c-6) Sí, ahora con ~25 tacos ya tiene que ser consciente de su mierda y que ella se la ha buscado (No me parece mal que le retiren la ciudadanía). Pero las raices de eso son de hace 10 años. Por eso no lo veo tan blanco o negro. Quizás ahora simplemente es tarde para una mejor solución.\nY que mira, que si la tía es tan fanática, con su pan se lo coma.\n[#6](c6#c-6) A ver, lo que pone en esa noticia es verdad aunque esté fatal explicado.\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/uk-65031943\nEsta es la fuente original y en ella no consigo entender cuándo fue lo de \"pedía dinero a través de internet y ese dinero acababa en manos de EI\".\nLo de \"se casó y tuvo hijos\" es lo que se dijo en el 2019, por lo que se casó y tuvo tres hijos teniendo entre 15 y 19 años. Que no ha pasado de 15 años a mayor de edad sin nada de por medio.\nPero vamos, que todo apunta a que apenas se arrepiente y que está demasiado vinculada al radicalismo como para dejarla volver sin vigilancia continua.\n[#6](c6#c-6) \"vivir de los beneficios\" es una traduccion horrible de \"live off benefits\" (o como sea el originbal). Basicamente, es vivir de las ayudas sociales que en Inglaterra se llaman benefits. T\n[#26](c26#c-26) No, vivir de la beneficiencia es vivir de instituciones y demas. Yo, por tener hijos, tengo derecho al child benefit. Eso no significa que mis hijos estan en la benficiciencia, sino que el gobierno me da unas cuantas libras al mes como ayuda para mantener a mis hijos.\n[#33](c33#c-33) Como va a ser la traduccion correcta si cambia el significado? Las ayudas economicas a los parados en España, en Inglaterra se llaman benefits. Cualquier ayuda economica del gobierno, se llama benefits como palabra generica.\nAqui estan los benefits a los que me refiero:\nhttps://www.gov.uk/browse/benefits/low-income\nNo creo que eso sea beneficencia.\n[#37](c37#c-37) Beneficencia = donaciones, charities, comedores sociales, etc. Benefits = prestaciones, subsidios y ayudas del estado (ver https://www.gov.uk/browse/benefits ).\nQuien vive de benefits aquí en UK es alguien que vive de las diferentes ayudas/prestaciones del estado (por hijo, por desempleo, por discapacidad, etc), no de donaciones/charities, que sería vivir de beneficencia.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Cierto, luego piensas que esta gente ponian videos de decapitaciones y quemar vivos a prisioneros y ....\nhay cosas que son dificiles de perdonar.\nBastante lógico. Los fanáticos, mejor cuanto más lejos, sin importar la edad a la que se fanatizó.\nAleluya!!! Por fin llega el sentido común y la cordura.\nTe vas a esclavizar yazidíes, a apedrear mujeres, a colaborar con terroristas. Pues ya quedate allí.\nSe unio a un protoestado cuyo objetivo era destruir -entre otros- al Reino Unido, pues que se joda. Que la manden a Siria donde seguro cumplira pena en condiciones. Bonus extra por quitarse el velo para no parecer lo que seguro que sigue siendo. Me recuerda al psicopata aquel Rodrigo Lanza que en el juicio por asesinato iba bien vestido, peinado y aseado para disimular que es un antifa\nSi les podemos denunciar por captar a personas y esto es delito deberiamos aceptar que hay personas en situacion de vulnerabilidad o incluso de falta de capacidad d raciocinio al completo (Menor de edad) como para que puedas asumir que no son totalmente libres de tomar esas decisiones (Puedes ser mayor de edad y tomar decisiones de manera coaccionada)\nQue sera lo siguiente? Te han estafado pero.. como eres mayor de edad, deberias haberte dado cuenta. Ah si, te ha violado... pero, deberias haber sido lista para no ir con esa persona que tenia malas pintas....\n[#10](c10#c-10) Saludos. Creo que la diferencia con esos ejemplos que das es que la víctima no se volvió victimario. Si el estafado se metió en un esquema ponzi y terminó estafando a otras personas posiblemente algo le caería también; igualmente si el violado termina considerando que ese comportamiento es correcto y él mismo viola a otros, impune dudo que salga. Podrán considerarse atenuantes, pero la responsabilidad existe, en el caso de ella igualmente habrá atenuantes, y tal vez por eso no sufriría una pena mayor como pasar el resto de su vida en una cárcel (al menos por ahora, otra cosa es que siga acumulando delitos), sino sólo la pérdida de la nacionalidad que es una medida que busca proteger a la sociedad.\nPues porque nunca fue británica para empezar. Solo es británico el que tiene sangre británica, del mismo modo que solo es Español el que tiene sangre española. Lo de la nacionalidad oficial es un papel con valor legal con fines organizativos, pero la verdadera nacionalidad, la que realmente cuenta, se lleva en los genes, se lleva en la sangre. Es de puro sentido común.",

The aircraft are replacing the IAF’s fleet of British origin AVRO, a twin-engine turboprop inducted way back in the 1960s.\nAccording to the deal, the first 16 aircraft will be assembled in Seville, Spain. The remaining 40 aircraft will be manufactured and assembled by the Tata Advanced Systems (TASL) in Vadodara, Gujarat, as part of an industrial partnership between the two companies.\nDisclaimer:\nPlease write your correct name and email address.

    "text": "A new global monument dedicated to answered prayer is under construction in the United Kingdom.\nComplete with a million interactive bricks, the Eternal Wall of Answered Prayer will be visible from six miles away.\nOrganizers are asking people to send in their testimonies to contribute to the project.\n\"I never let facts get in the way of Truth,\" Richard Gamble, founder of the Eternal Wall of Answered Prayer, told CBN News. \"I've been presented with so many facts about why this can't happen. And I believe in the truth that God can do it.\"\nFor 19 years, Gamble has pursued an audacious goal to build a monument to remind the world God still works through answered prayer and healing broken hearts. He explained how it all started.\n\"I was walking along here – and this flash just popped through my mind to build a wall where every brick represented a story of answered prayer,\" he said.\nTowering over 167 feet tall, the wall, modeled on a giant infinity loop, will be displayed at Coleshill in Birmingham. The national landmark's one million bricks will link to an answered prayer.\nGamble said, \"People can come and point their phones at the bricks – even at the ones miles away – and the phone will light up and it will tell them the story of hope that lies within.\"\nMichelle Heritage, Head of Partnerships for the Eternal Wall of Answered Prayer, says she witnessed the power of prayer as a single parent after God provided for her and her child.\n\"And it was really amazing to see how provision came in, how the work that I'd lost was actually replaced in a much better way – with work that had better pay. That was actually better suited to our lifestyle as a family in a new situation,\" Heritage said.\nHer story is just one example of the answered prayers that will rest in the monument.\nGamble said, \"The power of that – this is going to stand for hundreds of years.\"\nAfter two decades of planning, Gamble plans to break ground in 2024 and hopes to be operational in 2026. Now, Gamble is asking for your help by simply sharing your story of answered prayer.\n\"We got this funded, we have planning permission – I've got approval from the Prime Minister's office,\" he said. \"The hardest thing is getting Christians to give five minutes of their time – to actually share a story of what God has done.\"\nHeritage said, \"So, if you have a story of answered prayer, I would really encourage you, write it down and be ready to share it because your story of hope can be a stepping-stone for the next person's breakthrough.\"\nGamble also hopes this landmark will help break negative perceptions against faith, especially in the U.K. There, some surveys show only 31% of adults attend church.\n***First published in June 2023\nShare This article",
