    "text": "(CBS DETROIT) - In Michigan, many people remain cautiously hopeful about a potential ceasefire in Gaza .\n\"People are so desperate to have the hostages returned. I mean, I have the 213 days they've been away. And people are just so pinning for some good news about the hostages,\" said Rabbi Asher Lopatin with the Greater Ann Arbor Jewish Federation . \"We can't afford to give up in this world. We can't afford to give up on our values. We can't have all the thousands that have died in Israel and in Gaza die in vain. So it really has to be a war that gets resolved.\"\nIn a statement, Dawud Walid, the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations Michigan Chapter , issued the following statement:\n\"Netanyahu's plan to attack Rafah despite a ceasefire deal on the table shows that not only does he not care about the lives of innocent Palestinians; he also seemingly has no sincere concern for Israeli hostages. It is a national disgraceful that our tax dollars will continue to be used to inflict war crimes against the people of Gaza.\"\nBreaking down Hamas accepting Egyptian-Qatari cease-fire proposal 08:09 For those connected to Israel or Gaza, the war has been very personal for a long time. But Wayne State University professor Saeed Khan said social media has played a role in bringing the reality of the conflict to more people.\n\"The images of what has been going on, particularly in Gaza, now are ones that are consuming many people. Especially young people as we've seen with reactions on college campuses,\" said Khan.\nHe said American demonstrators, including those in Michigan, likely won't influence Israel or Hamas, but they could have impacts here at home.\n\"But I think what it is important to then recognize is if this is heard in Washington. And then if Washington is then responding in a way that it can exert its influence and leverage on its ally in the region, which, of course, is Israel,\" said Khan.",

    "text": "The couple had initially agreed to share chores and expenses equally, but after his promotion, he stopped contributing.\nRelationships are often about compromise and mutual respect, but what happens when one partner feels the scales are tipping unfairly? That's what happened to a 30-year-old woman, [u/Designer-Mongoose308](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hh2evz/my_bf_called_me_a_gold_digger_so_i_left_now_he/), who recently shared that her boyfriend called her a \"[gold digger](https://scoop.upworthy.com/woman-calls-out-boyfriends-mates-for-calling-her-a-gold-digger-reveals-she-makes-twice-his-salary)\" after she requested fair compensation for taking on extra responsibilities. She recounted how an initially balanced arrangement with her boyfriend turned sour after he [received a promotion](https://scoop.upworthy.com/employee-rewarded-with-promotion-after-overcoming-micromanaging-boss-absurd-working-conditions). Despite his increased contribution, he began slacking on household chores, leaving her to take on the extra burden. She shared her story on Reddit, asking for opinions from those who have faced similar situations.\nIt all began with an arrangement that seemed equitable. \"I moved in with my boyfriend a little over a year ago. We had an understanding that we'd go [50/50 on chores and bills](https://scoop.upworthy.com/this-couple-split-their-bills-equitably-as-a-percentage-rather-than-50-50-and-it-just-makes-sense) until we decided to have a baby,\" she wrote. \"I believed this was fair because if we did have a child, I'd be putting my body, career, and life on the line, so he'd need to contribute more to balance it out.\" For a while, everything went smoothly. That changed two months ago when her boyfriend received a promotion and a slight raise. While his financial contributions improved, his effort at home dwindled.\n\"He stopped doing his share of the chores. I found moldy pots he'd left in the sink for days, and he skipped buying groceries during his assigned weeks. It started to feel like I was the only one maintaining the house,\" she explained. Frustrated by the growing imbalance, she tried to offer solutions. \"I suggested hiring a cleaner to split the load, but he said he didn't want strangers in the house. Then I suggested we order groceries to save time, but he called me frivolous for even bringing it up,\" she wrote. Seeing no other option, she proposed a new arrangement, \"I told him I'd be happy to take on[ more of the household responsibilities](https://scoop.upworthy.com/therapist-explains-underlying-issue-behind-unequal-sharing-of-household-chores), but if I did that, it would mean reducing my work hours from five days to four.\"\n\"Since this would impact my career and income, I also said I'd expect to be fairly compensated for the additional labor,\" she said.\nHis response stunned her. \"He called me a 'gold digger,'\" she wrote. \"I wasn't asking for designer handbags or luxury vacations. I was asking for fair compensation for the extra work I'd be doing to keep our home running smoothly.\" Feeling [undervalued and disrespected](https://scoop.upworthy.com/finance-expert-explains-why-it-is-utterly-important-to-openly-discuss-salaries), she decided to leave. \"I packed my belongings, blocked him on all platforms, and moved out that same day,\" she shared.\nAfter learning what happened between the couple, their friends were on her side in this situation. \"One of the male friends we have in common mentioned that he's been watching podcasts recently about masculinity,\" she added, which gave her the idea of where all his recent thoughts were coming from.\nHer post struck a chord with Reddit users, many of whom applauded her courage and shared their own experiences.\n[u/MaintenanceWine](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hh2evz/comment/m2olpk5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) commented, \"Agreed!

    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",
