    "text": "Former Browns kicker Phil Dawson will be honored as a Browns legend this weekend. Joshua Gunter, cleveland.com\nBy Dan Labbe, cleveland.com BEREA, Ohio — It’s fitting that former Browns left tackle Joe Thomas crashed the Zoom call for kicker Phil Dawson, a member of the 2024 Browns Legends class being inducted this weekend. Earlier in the call, he cited the support he got from players like Thomas when discussing his longevity in the NFL.\n“I got a message from Joe Thomas this morning and the things he said to me, I can’t even believe because I was just the kicker over there doing my thing,” Dawson said, “and here’s the greatest left tackle to ever play professional football thanking me for the job I did and how I helped him. That’s the special sauce, when your teammates and coaches could count on you to do your job. I can’t think of anything more rewarding than that.”\nMore Cleveland Browns coverage The on-the-fly adjustment the Browns made with Denzel Ward: Defensive takeaways Giants vs. Browns NFL Week 3 prediction, odds and best bet: Can Cleveland cover a big spread?

    "text": "My mother has severe dementia. We have the same routine every night. I will take her to the bathroom, get her ready for bed and she takes her meds. Every night when I go in her room to tell her that I need to help her up so I can help her to the bathroom, she gives me a mean look and just stares at me. She doesn't like to stand and walk because it hurts her back and knees. Once I get her up she's pretty good at walking, just slow. However, getting her to cooperate is horrible. She fights and struggles against the chair, refusing to help me. She pushes back with her feet and hits and kicks. She's very strong. I have to get her into the bathroom so she doesn't have an accident. What can I do? I get extremely anxiety filled every evening when I know that the battle is soon to begin. I try to be as nice and comforting as possible. She's fairly cooperative in the mornings and pleasant during the day. It's the evenings that are so horrible. Is there a way to overcome this? Is there something I could do different? She only uses the bathroom twice a day now because I can't get her to go. She says she doesn't have to when I ask. I know that she has to go in the evening. We barely get her on the toilet and she's going. I will take and suggestions. I am at my wits end and a stressed out wreck over this.",

    "text": "FOREST CITY, Iowa , July 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The NMTC Program has been vital to the nation's economy and low-income communities since established by Congress in December of 2000. NMTCs have spurred $8 of private investment for every $1 of Federal funding, revitalizing underserved rural and urban communities nationwide.\nThrough 2023, $76 billion in tax credit authority has been awarded by the CDFI Fund; more than $72 billion helped stimulate 8,000+ projects, creating over 1.2 million jobs in communities having a history of disinvestment.\nBipartisan Support for Over 20 Years\nAs congressional members come and go, RDP joins the many communities and businesses working to educate legislators on the progress and vitality of this valued program. The Program has had great bipartisan support since inception, recognized as a pivotal force in helping communities not only recover but grow stronger through job creation and business/community development. As communities grow, they become more attractive to investors catalyzing a ripple effect that spurs further investments and revitalization.\nThe NMTC program was initially authorized by Congress for seven years as part of the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000. Since then, Congress has extended the NMTC eight times, most recently through the Omnibus and COVID Relief and Response Act of 2020 at $5 billion , the largest extension in the history of the Credit; scheduled to expire December 31, 2025 . Proposed bipartisan legislation (S.234 & H.R.2539) would extend the program indefinitely and expand both allocation level and investor base.\nHow Does the NMTC Program Work?\nThe NMTC Program permits individual and corporate taxpayers to receive a non-refundable tax credit against their federal income tax in exchange for making equity investments in financial intermediaries known as Community Development Entities (CDEs). A CDE is a domestic corporation or partnership that provides loans, investments, or financial counseling in low-income urban and rural communities. CDEs apply to compete annually for NMTC allocation authority from the CDFI Fund. If received, NMTCs are carefully invested toward select, qualified projects expected to have maximum economic and catalytic impact in low-income communities. Projects must meet the specific criteria of Severely Distressed, Targeted Populations, or Qualified Non-Metro Counties. Since inception of the NMTC Program, the CDFI has completed 19 allocation rounds and issued 1,563 awards totaling $76 billion in tax allocation authority.\nNMTCs often fill the financing gap when traditional financing falls short or is unavailable, such as in smaller rural communities located outside the preferred region of a traditional lender, or to spur jobs and economic development in communities desperately in need of economic stability. NMTC investments offer more favorable financing terms and conditions than are available through conventional financing to encourage investments within low-income qualified regions. The tax credit provided to the investor typically totals 39% of the total investment cost and is claimed over a period of seven years.\nProjects Financed with NMTCs\nThe flexibility of NMTCs support a wide range of development, both for-profit and non-profit businesses in manufacturing, food, retail, housing, health, technology, energy, education, and childcare… nearly everything that spurs economic development can be financed (examples), with the exception of specified businesses relative to massage/tanning, gambling , collectibles, liquor, and such.\nRural Development Partners\nRural Development Partners is a CDE with a national service area. From 2004 through 2023, RDP has won twelve NMTC awards from the U.S. Treasury totaling $751.7 million , helping 50 businesses and nonprofits expand to provide quality jobs, economic impacts, and healthy food access in underserved communities.

    "text": "The 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded jointly to Dr. Katalin Kariko and Dr. Drew Weissman. The awarding committee cited their basic research that led to the development of effective messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines for the novel coronavirus. It has now become common knowledge that mRNA can be used to create vaccines. But as mRNA can quickly degrade and cause an inflammatory response in cells to which it is artificially delivered, it was thought, in the nascent stages of development, that it would be difficult to use mRNA in medicine. Kariko embarked on mRNA research while she was a graduate student in Hungary. In 1985, she moved to the United States, where she applied for federal research funding almost every year, to no avail. At a U.S. university, she even had to agree to a demotion so that she could continue her research there. One day, Kariko, still in difficulties, had a chance encounter with Weissman while waiting for a copy machine. Several years on, in 2005, she managed to publish a research paper on mRNA, thanks to Weissman’s collaboration. However, the paper received little attention at the time. Several more years passed and she showed her research results to German pharmaceutical startup BioNTech, opening the way for mRNA vaccine development. For more than 25 years, governments and most researchers had failed to see the potential and value of mRNA vaccine technology, which has now contributed so immensely to humankind. In 2006, one of my colleagues and I published a paper introducing a method for generating induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Based on this paper, I was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, alongside Sir John Gurdon. Some people seemed surprised at how soon — just six years after the publishing of the paper — the Nobel honor was given for iPS cells. In truth, however, iPS cell research had its start 50 years earlier. In 1962 — the year when I was born — Gurdon, then a young researcher in the United Kingdom, reported a crucial discovery: When he removed the nucleus of a frog egg and replaced it with that of a cell from a tadpole’s intestine, the modified egg cell grew into a new frog as a normally fertilized egg cell would do. In those days, it was thought that no new specimen could be born from the nucleus of a cell with distinct roles already assigned, such as an intestinal cell. I can imagine how enthusiastically the young British researcher must have worked to prove such conventional wisdom wrong, carrying out an experiment using a difficult technique known as somatic cell nuclear transfer. In his research, a tadpole that was born through nuclear transfer matured into an adult frog, and such frogs were able to breed. Gurdon’s research led to the discovery that even intestinal cells contain a blueprint for creating cells for the rest of the body. After many years of little recognition, his research suddenly took center stage when it was announced in 1997 that a cloned sheep had been birthed from an adult somatic cell, which eventually led to the development of iPS cells in 2006. The unstinting efforts Kariko and Gurdon made in their youth would greatly impact society after the passage of decades. Despite the clear importance of their research now, even they could hardly have predicted the impact when they started. This shows just how crucial it is to encourage researchers to take on ambitious basic research so that we may have as many scientific breakthroughs as possible. As basic research, especially ambitious and pioneering research, often requires decades before it produces tangible results, it is generally difficult to assess how promising the work is. On the other hand, applied research projects, such as for developing new therapies, should obviously have definite goals, as they can take advantage of the pioneering work that has been done already. It is also easier to evaluate such applied projects in a short time span, compared to basic research. Across the world, research subsidies from governments tend to focus on applied research. Since government leaders and officials usually come and go in a few years’ time, it seems inevitable that they would prioritize such research, whose effects may become tangible during their tenure. Private sector research funding is one means for promoting ambitious research. For example, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) in the United States is well-known for turning out Nobel Prize winners. It was founded in 1953 with donations from industrialist Howard Hughes, who had amassed a huge fortune. Though it calls itself an institute, HHMI is focused on providing support to biomedical research — it employs researchers who lead research laboratories at top U.S. universities and other research institutes. It has an endowment of $24.2 billion, and spends about $760 million annually to support medical and biological researchers across the United States. HHMI is also unique in that it supports individuals — researchers themselves — instead of research projects, as it values people who are creative and who have research competence, as well as the perseverance to overcome difficulties. At a minimum, it supports researchers for five years. A researcher supported by HHMI can pursue bold projects without worrying about short-term results. Since 2000 alone, 26 current and former HHMI researchers have won Nobel Prizes in physiology or medicine and in chemistry. In the United States, many private sector funds and donations not only support research efforts but also help ordinary people deepen their understanding of science. The Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History in Washington, for instance, has extensive collections of plants, animals, fossils, minerals, rocks, meteorites and cultural artifacts. Its annual revenue stood at $80.3 million in 2022, with donations accounting for 11% of the total and endowment returns for 14%. In the United Kingdom, the Wellcome Trust is well-known as a charitable foundation focused on health research. It was founded in 1936 by pharmaceutical entrepreneur Sir Henry Wellcome to manage an investment portfolio now totaling £37.8 billion ($47.8 billion). It extends £1 billion annually to research projects related to such core areas as climate change and health, infectious diseases and mental health. The foundation also runs a free library and museum to help people learn about medicine and medical history. In Japan, there are many grant-offering foundations that support research activities in the medical field. Nevertheless, they are inferior to their U.S. and U.K. peers in terms of grant scale and duration, with the largest foundation having an endowment of about ¥100 billion. That said, multiple foundations have recently launched new programs for young researchers, providing grants for as long as 10 years. And some have introduced research mentorship programs enabling young researchers to receive advice from senior colleagues. I look forward to seeing young researchers in these programs take on bold basic research — hopefully yielding groundbreaking results. For my part, when I became an independent researcher, I was granted some research subsidies. When I approached the Japan Science and Technology Agency with a highly risky plan to generate iPS cells, it agreed to subsidize me for five years, providing more than ¥50 million per annum. In retrospect, I had relatively few research achievements, but the opportunity given to me by the agency helped me gain momentum, and lead to the development of iPS cells. Two years ago, I retired as director of Kyoto University’s Center for iPS Cell Research and Application to concentrate on my own research. This has allowed me to communicate more with young researchers from other institutes. There are many talented researchers, and I feel they will make major breakthroughs once they have the chance to pursue bold research. In August, some 57,000 people donated ¥920 million to a crowdfunding project by Tokyo’s National Museum of Nature and Science. The museum shot past its goal of ¥100 million in a single day, making headlines. It was good that such a massive sum was donated so quickly. Yet, I feel that the story’s newsworthiness points to a major problem for Japan. If more donations are made to basic research projects and museums in Japan, such stories could become commonplace. I expect donations to contribute, in tandem with public sector support, to an acceleration of Japan’s scientific and technological development.
