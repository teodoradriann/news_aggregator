    "text": "( MENAFN - AzerNews)\nFatime Letifova Read more\nIn recent days, the fastest progress towards the peace treatybetween Azerbaijan and Armenia has been a concern for someanti-Azerbaijan forces. While the Armenian authorities say they areready for peace with Azerbaijan, the opposition forces in thecountry go the extra mile to hamper it.\nThus, protests against the return of 4 villages of Gazakh regionto Azerbaijan are being held in Tavush. Local residents blockedroads in Tavush province, including the highway to Georgia and theYerevan-Goyche road.\nThe institution that supports these protests the most is theAll-Armenian Church. It is interesting that an enterprise, whichshould instill peace and kindness in people, meddles in politicsand creates tension in the region. It should be noted that sinceApril, under the leadership of Bagrat Galstyan, Archbishop of theTavush Diocese of Armenia, opposition slogans have been raisedagainst Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan.\nThis coincides with the time when Pashinyan agreed to returnAzerbaijan's 4 villages, which have been under Armenian occupationfor over 30 years.\nIt seems that the church is not out of control, and some otherforces are behind it to oppose the authorities.\nAt this point, all suppositions focus on the West. It should notbe forgotten that the signing of the peace agreement in the regionworries the West the most.\nIf we look at history, the basis of the wars of two historicalTurkish states, the Safavid and Ottoman empires, which resulted inhuge losses, was due to the agency networks and insidious plans ofthe West. For many years, two great powers fought a war; humanlives and material resources were mobilised, and as a result, bothsides suffered. Taking advantage of this tension, Western kingdomstried to conduct a policy of expansion in the region.\nEven in modern times, the West remains faithful to its traditionand tries to coerce the Armenian people to war in order to hinderthe development and peace initiatives for the security of the SouthCaucasus.\nThe West, which once condemned the activities of Russianpeacekeepers in Garabagh, is now, for some reason, upset byMoscow's premature withdrawal from the region. It even wantspeacekeeping forces to return to Garabagh. Thus, Senior expert atthe Carnegie Endowment and specialist on Garabagh Tomas De Waalsays Russian peacekeepers should have stayed in Garabagh.\nBecause the presence of peacekeepers in Garabagh created ampleconditions for Western intervention in the region, Russia seemedlike a potential threat in the region. Today, the West has to putan end to its dreams about the region.\nIt should not be forgotten that the conclusion of the peacetreaty between Azerbaijan and Armenia guarantees development inmany areas.\nFirst of all, if there is no war or conflict in the region,there is no need for the mediation of external forces. This meansthat Azerbaijan and Armenia will not only recognise their bordersbut will also start cooperating within the framework of the opendoor principle. So, is the West happy or sad about it?\nSecondly, Armenia's signing of a peace treaty with Azerbaijanwill contribute to its relations with Turkiye, and the borders willopen, which will massively affect Armenia's economic structure. Onthe other hand, Armenia will also benefit from Azerbaijan's giantoil and gas projects as well as its projects, in green energy.\nThirdly, and most importantly, the development of Armenia in theregion will undermine the plans of colonialist countries likeFrance to influence the South Caucasus for evil purposes. Yerevanwill no longer have to be a toy for other countries.\nUndoubtedly, the signing of the peace treaty in the region willcontribute a lot to Armenia as well as Azerbaijan and the SouthCaucasus as a whole.\nHowever, the listed facts are not in the interest of the West economic and social development of the South Caucasus will notbe though as good intention by some Western countries pursuingcolonialist policy.\nFor example, political analyst Thomas De Waal, who made astatement to the Armenians, demonstrated that he belongs to thiscategory in every sense. He said that neither the West nor he issatisfied with the current situation in the South Caucasus, in his comment on De Waal's statement, British expert NeilWatson has called him biased. Watson added that de Waal is actuallyaware of the real situation in South Caucasus.\n\"Thomas de Waal, despite being an acknowledged expert on theSouth Caucasus, has repeatedly proven that he has biasedsympathies, publicly regarding Azerbaijan as the aggressor in theGarabagh conflict. The fact is that he is fully aware that,following the withdrawal of the so-called Russian 'peacekeepers',Armenia sits completely isolated in the South Caucasus and is dutybound to comply with requests from Azerbaijan, which hassophisticated weaponry and the support of Israel and Turkiye.\nHe clearly believes that there is a risk that Azerbaijan willnow try to invade the remainder of Armenia, despite President IlhamAliyev repeatedly pledging that this is not an objective, the so-called 'peacekeeping' troops will now beredeployed in Ukraine, thereby making resolution of that problemeven more difficult and challenging,\" the expert added.\nHe also said that Azerbaijan is no longer under the influence ofSoviet Union and never will be under the influence of NATO and EUeither.\n\"Europe is seeing to establish an outpost in the former SovietUnion that was formerly unavailable. Clearly Azerbaijan, havingutilised the Russian expansionist mentality to its advantage for ashort period, is never going to come under the direct influence ofthe EU or NATO,\" Watson noted.\nThe expert said that Armenia is using this situation and canbecome a satellite of European Union in the South Caucasus.\n\"Armenia, a Christian country with negligible resources, adwindling population and widespread diaspora in the US and France,particularly, can become an EU satellite in the South Caucasus andin the former Soviet space, particularly now that Russianinvolvement has been virtually been eliminated. Furthermore, the EUis keen to support Prime Minister Pashinyan and his anti-Russianstance, rather than a possibly pro-Russian future successor,\" hestressed.\nTalking about the protest that is ongoing in Tavush, expertnoted that Armenians want to gain foreign media's attention.\n\"I do believe they are taking place to garner western supportand gain coverage from the western media in the hope of furtherdelaying the signing of a peace treaty on a purely bilateral basisbetween Azerbaijan and Armenia,\" N. Watson concluded.\nMENAFN06052024000195011045ID1108179730\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "title": "Huelga en Boeing: trabajadores rechazan oferta de contrato y paralizan fábricas",
    "text": "Trabajadores de montaje de aviones abandonaron sus puestos a primera hora de este viernes en fábricas de Boeing próximas a Seattle luego de los miembros del sindicado votaron abrumadoramente a favor de la huelga y rechazaron una oferta de contrato que habría elevado sus salarios un 25% en cuatro años.\nLa huelga comenzó a en la madrugada, menos de tres horas después de que la rama local de la Asociación Internacional de Maquinistas y Trabajadores Aeroespaciales dijo que el 94.6% de los trabajadores que votaron rechazaron el contrato, y que un 96% aprobaron la huelga, superando con facilidad el requisito de dos tercios favorables.\nEl paro afecta a 33,000 maquinistas de Boeing, en su mayoría en el estado de Washington, y se espera que paralice la producción de los aviones comerciales más vendidos del grupo. Aunque no afectará a los vuelos comerciales, supone otro revés para el gigante aeronáutico, cuya reputación y finanzas se han visto golpeadas este año por problemas de facturación y múltiples investigaciones federales.\nnasa 24 Ago ¿Cuándo regresarán a la Tierra los dos astronautas varados en el espacio? Esto decidió la NASA Estados Unidos 20 Ago FAA ordena inspección de cientos de Boeing 787 tras incidente con avión de LATAM Los operarios en huelga montan el 737 Max, el más vendido de Boeing, además del 777 y del avión de carga 767, en las fábricas de Renton y Everett, en Washington. La protesta podría no paralizar la producción de los 787 Dreamliners, cuyo montaje corre a cargo de trabajadores no sindicados en Carolina del Sur.\nLos maquinistas ganan una media de $75,608 al año, sin contar las horas extra, y con la oferta llegarían a los $106,350 al final del contrato de cuatro años, según Boeing.\nPero la propuesta estaba alejada de la petición inicial del sindicato de un alza del 40% en tres años. Además, se pidió el restablecimiento de las pensiones tradicionales suprimidas hace una década, pero aceptó un incremento de las contribuciones de Boeing a planes de pensiones de los empleados.\nEn el exterior de la fábrica de Renton, la gente se manifestó con carteles y bocinas, mientras sonaban canciones como “We’re Not Gonna Take It”, de Twisted Sister y “Look What You Made Me Do”, de Taylor Swift.\nBoeing respondió afirmando que estaba “dispuesta a regresar a la mesa para alcanzar un nuevo acuerdo”.\n“El mensaje fue claro: el acuerdo tentativo que alcanzamos con la dirección del sindicato no era aceptable para sus miembros. Seguimos comprometidos a restablecer nuestra relación con nuestros empleados y el sindicato”, dijo la compañía en un comunicado.\nMuy pocas cosas le han salido bien a Boeing este año, desde la rotura de un panel que dejó un enorme agujero en uno de sus aviones comerciales en pleno vuelo en enero, a la decisión de la NASA de dejar dos astronautas en el espacio antes de que regresasen a la Tierra en una cápsula plagada de problemas fabricada por la compañía.\nLa huelga privará a Boeing de la vital liquidez que obtiene al entregar sus pedidos a las aerolíneas. Será un desafío más para el nuevo director general, Kelly Ortberg, quien hace seis semanas recibió el encargo de enderezar el rumbo de una firma que ha perdido más de $25,000 millones en los últimos seis años y ha quedado por detrás de su rival europeo, Airbus.\nOrtberg hizo un esfuerzo de última hora para salvar un acuerdo que había sido respaldado de forma unánime por los negociadores sindicales. El miércoles, dijo a los maquinistas que “nadie gana” con un paro, y que una huelga pondría la recuperación de Boeing en peligro y plantearía más dudas sobre la empresa a ojos de sus clientes.\n“Para Boeing, no es ningún secreto que nuestro negocio atraviesa un periodo difícil, en parte debido a nuestros propios errores en el pasado”, manifestó. “Trabajando junto, sé que podemos volver al buen camino, pero una huelga pondría en peligro nuestra recuperación compartida, erosionando más aún la confianza de nuestros clientes y perjudicando nuestra capacidad para determinar nuestro futuro juntos”.\nPero los trabajadores no tenían ganas de escuchar.\nHolden apuntó que Ortberg tenía una posición complicada porque los maquinistas están resentidos por el estancamiento de los salarios y las concesiones que llevan realizando desde 2008 en pensiones y atención sanitaria para evitar que la empresa trasladase puestos de trabajo a otros lugares.\n“Es difícil compensar 16 años”, dijo.\nLa votación fue también un revés para Holden y los negociadores sindicales, que habían recomendado dar el visto bueno a la oferta de contrato. Holden, quien predijo que la huelga saldría adelante, apuntó que la asociación hará una encuesta entre sus afiliados para decidir en qué cuestiones quieren hacer hincapié cuando se reanuden las negociaciones.",

    "title": "Range Rover: Hotel as work of art",
    "text": "My work as a ski and travel writer has taken me to many memorable places. Often, it’s a landscape that sticks with me—or how the weather I experienced made those landforms come to life. Sometimes it’s the quality or the verve of what I did there that resonates. Once in a while it’s a person whose passion or forbearance lives in memory. And then, much more occasionally, it’s an institution of some kind that rattles the neurons in unforeseen ways. Such was the case on a trip to the Swiss resort of Klosters last year. The romantic postcard village stands in stark contrast to the bustling alpine metropolis of Davos but a few kilometres distant, and though it’s a town I’d visited before, skiing over from Davos, and even stayed in once, I hadn’t had occasion to take its pulse or explore its understated mien. Last year, however, I had occasion to stay somewhere that opened my eyes to a celebrated history—Hotel Chesa Grischuna, a creaking wooden edifice that seemed more icon than inn. That the “Chesa”—as all know it—was conceived as a thoughtful work with a message is apparent to even the most casual sidewalk passerby, but revelatory when you dig into the details. Erected by Hans Guler, scion of a family of mountain guides, in 1938, and turning on classic Swiss multistory post-and-beam style, the many joyous inclusions on the external walls and interior by local painters and artisans was no frivolous community art project. Rather, it was coordinated conscious resistance intended to show that some Swiss wanted nothing to do with the simple, stripped-down, neo-classical architecture and iconography being encouraged (and often imposed) by the Nazi party to enforce its ideology among Germanic countries. Given the protest baked into it, no small wonder that Klosters, with its Goldilocks isolation (not too much, not too little), and the light-beacon Chesa, presented as post-war crucibles that attracted the royal families of Sweden, the Netherlands and Britain, as well as writers, producers, directors and stars like Gene Kelly, Greta Garbo, Gregory Peck, Lauren Bacall, Audrey Hepburn, Yul Brynner, Paul Newman and others looking to escape attention during Hollywood’s Golden Age. While mucky-mucks and celebrities that literally defined American royalty could be spotted nightly in the hotel’s restaurant (to this day one of the Alps’ best with its genuine feel and impeccable service), residents left them alone, gifting them with alpine quietude. I have the good fortune to not only stay a few nights, but to be guided through both structure and story by the Chesa’s new owner, former television journalist Astrid von Stockar, whose current passion project is to protect the hotel’s heritage and many salient details. With a sparkle in her eye, Astrid flew me through the restaurant, pointing out original chairs, cushions held by leather straps, and even the first china—for each of which she has sourced people capable of doing restoration or identical replacement. Some of this she has taken on herself. For example, stressing over how to fix the affront of too-short curtains, she discovered enough original fabric turned up in the hems to simply lengthen them. When she identifies King Charles III’s favourite table—the round one in the corner with windows on both sides—I realize I’ve sat there before with friends. Finally, she shows me the part of the dining area, now taken by tables, from which an old grand piano was once moved; we follow the instrument’s trail downstairs to where it now occupies space on the legendary basement bar’s famous dance floor, scene of much merriment and tales of Gene Kelly tap-dancing on the bar-top. Astrid even cracks the door to the Chesa’s famous two-lane bowling alley, added in the 1950s. Upstairs again, sitting to dine, it’s impossible not to register the woodwork, panelled ceilings and decor as eye-drawing art that was intended to be seen from this angle. For Astrid, who had come here as a visitor since she was a child, the Chesa “is the heart of Klosters,” and like all hearts, in need of tending. For someone whose work once turned on storytelling, the Chesa and its guestbook represent hundreds of stories braided into a larger tale of the town’s character and nexus of history—like the small painting with which a young Winston Churchill bid adieu, adding “My only regret is having to leave this wonderful place.” As American writer and Klosters resident, Irwin Shaw, penned of the town in one of his post-war stories: In the angry days through which the world was passing, there was a ray of hope in this good-natured polyglot chorus of people who were not threatening each other, who smiled at strangers, who had collected in these shining white hills merely to enjoy the innocent pleasures of sun and snow… Beyond those who visited often, Greta Garbo’s longstanding residency in Klosters became an identity statement: if the notoriously publicity-shy star felt safe here, so could anyone. Everything was on the down-low and visitors adopted a humble demeanour; they didn’t brag, show wealth, or smash champagne bottles. Even today, Switzerland is a place where globally famous folk famously find refuge (think Tina Turner and Shania Twain), something for which Klosters in the 1950s was both bauplan and microcosm. As art reflecting this ethos, the Chesa Grischuna offered peace, solace and camaraderie to a generation. Leslie Anthony is a Whistler-based author, editor, biologist and bon vivant who has never met a mountain he didn’t like. n",

Arjuna is shown the Yoga of Meditation by Sri Krishna, who also teaches the techniques. Sri Krishna discusses the importance of activity in getting ready for meditation and how fulfilling acts of devotion may elevate one's spiritual consciousness and purify the mind. Lord Krishna describes the challenges one encounters when attempting to master their thoughts as well as the strategies for doing so. Krishna also explains how one might become one with God by concentrating their thoughts on Paramatma. Let us check out 11 verses from the Bhagavad Gita on the benefits of performing yoga. 11 Verses From Bhagavad Gita On Benefits Of Performing Yoga 1. प्रशान्तात्मा विगतभीर्ब्रह्मचारिव्रते स्थित: | मन: संयम्य मच्चित्तो युक्त आसीत मत्पर: || 14|| praśhāntātmā vigata-bhīr brahmachāri-vrate sthitaḥ manaḥ sanyamya mach-chitto yukta āsīta mat-paraḥ With myself alone as the ultimate aim, the watchful yogi should meditate with a calm, brave, and unshakable mind, and with a firm commitment to celibacy. 2. यदा विनियतं चित्तमात्मन्येवावतिष्ठते | नि:स्पृह: सर्वकामेभ्यो युक्त इत्युच्यते तदा || 18|| yadā viniyataṁ chittam ātmanyevāvatiṣhṭhate niḥspṛihaḥ sarva-kāmebhyo yukta ityuchyate tadā They acquire the whole discipline of withdrawing the mind from self-serving desires and fixating it on the supreme benefit of the self. 3. यत्रोपरमते चित्तं निरुद्धं योगसेवया | यत्र चैवात्मनात्मानं पश्यन्नात्मनि तुष्यति || 20|| yatroparamate chittaṁ niruddhaṁ yoga-sevayā yatra chaivātmanātmānaṁ paśhyann ātmani tuṣhyati Through the practice of yoga, the mind becomes peaceful and free from worldly activities. This allows the yogi to see the soul through a cleansed mind and experience inner bliss. 4. तं विद्याद् दु:खसंयोगवियोगं योगसञ्ज्ञितम् | स निश्चयेन योक्तव्यो योगोऽनिर्विण्णचेतसा || 23|| taṁ vidyād duḥkha-sanyoga-viyogaṁ yogasaṅjñitam sa niśhchayena yoktavyo yogo ’nirviṇṇa-chetasā Yoga is the state of severing oneself from union with misery. It is important to practise this yoga with commitment and without negativity. 5. यतो यतो निश्चरति मनश्चञ्चलमस्थिरम् | ततस्ततो नियम्यैतदात्मन्येव वशं नयेत् || 26|| yato yato niśhcharati manaśh chañchalam asthiram tatas tato niyamyaitad ātmanyeva vaśhaṁ nayet Lord Krishna explains the potency of yoga to warrior prince Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita. (Image Source: ISKCON Bangalore) One should constantly return their restless and wavering thoughts back to God, no matter where or when it wanders. 6. युञ्जन्नेवं सदात्मानं योगी विगतकल्मष: | सुखेन ब्रह्मसंस्पर्शमत्यन्तं सुखमश्नुते || 28|| yuñjann evaṁ sadātmānaṁ yogī vigata-kalmaṣhaḥ sukhena brahma-sansparśham atyantaṁ sukham aśhnute By merging with God, the self-controlled yogi becomes free from material pollution and attains the ultimate condition of perfect enjoyment via continual communication with the Supreme. 7. असंशयं महाबाहो मनो दुर्निग्रहं चलम् | अभ्यासेन तु कौन्तेय वैराग्येण च गृह्यते || 35|| asanśhayaṁ mahā-bāho mano durnigrahaṁ chalam abhyāsena tu kaunteya vairāgyeṇa cha gṛihyate Lord Krishna said, \"What you say is true, O mighty-armed son of Kunti—the mind is indeed very hard to control.\" But it is controllable with practice and distance. 8. असंयतात्मना योगो दुष्प्राप इति मे मति: | वश्यात्मना तु यतता शक्योऽवाप्तुमुपायत: || 36|| asaṅyatātmanā yogo duṣhprāpa iti me matiḥ vaśhyātmanā tu yatatā śhakyo ’vāptum upāyataḥ For someone with an uncontrolled mind, yoga might be challenging to achieve. Nevertheless, excellence in yoga is achievable for those who have mastered mental control and who work hard using the right techniques. 9. योगिनामपि सर्वेषां मद्गतेनान्तरात्मना | श्रद्धावान्भजते यो मां स मे युक्ततमो मत: || 47|| yoginām api sarveṣhāṁ mad-gatenāntar-ātmanā śhraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ sa me yuktatamo mataḥ I hold the utmost regard for yogis who have a constant state of absorption in me and who practise devotion to me with a strong sense of faith. 10. युञ्जन्नेवं सदात्मानं योगी विगतकल्मष: | सुखेन ब्रह्मसंस्पर्शमत्यन्तं सुखमश्नुते || 28|| yuñjann evaṁ sadātmānaṁ yogī vigata-kalmaṣhaḥ sukhena brahma-sansparśham atyantaṁ sukham aśhnute By merging with God, the self-controlled yogi becomes free from material pollution and attains the ultimate condition of perfect enjoyment via continual communication with the Supreme.

    "text": "As we eagerly await the return of [Selling Sunset](https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/tv-and-film/selling-sunset-season-eight/) for its eighth (yes, really!) season, we've obviously been doing our due diligence and refreshing our minds on all of the iconic cast members of the hit reality show. We've been reminding ourselves [who's beefing with who](https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/tv-and-film/selling-sunset-cast-who-is-still-friends/), [who's dating who](https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/tv-and-film/how-many-of-the-selling-sunset-cast-has-jason-dated/) and who's BFFs with who. Now, if you cast your minds back to series six, you'll remember that that there had been concerns from fans that without Selling Sunset’s resident villain, [Christine Quinn](https://graziadaily.co.uk/celebrity/news/christine-quinn-selling-sunset-left-oppenheim-group/) ( [who left at the end of series five](https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/tv-and-film/is-christine-quinn-returning-to-selling-sunset/#/)), the show could be entering its flop era. But thankfully season six had some of the best drama we’ve had yet and this is, in part, thanks to new recruit [Bre Tiesi](https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/tv-and-film/who-is-selling-sunsets-bre-tiesi/). The agent joined [the Oppenheim Group](https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/tv-and-film/selling-sunset-celebrity-clients/) with a ‘don’t give a fuck’ attitude and a backstory which is quite simply written for reality television. Not only was she six-weeks postpartum when she strutted into the infamous industrial chic Oppenheim Group office, she had also just given birth to Nick Cannon’s eighth child. When Grazia caught up with Bre just days after her Selling Sunset debut in 2023, she set the record straight about opinions on what she describes as her ‘unconventional’ relationship with Nick Cannon - who has twelve children in total with six women - two of which are with Mariah Carey. Bre and Nick's son Legendary Love Cannon was born in June last year. ‘I've been getting ripped apart for the last almost two years now. Because of who my partner is,’ she told us when we chatted to her last year. ‘But I think for me, I'm so secure in my in my relationship with my partner and who I am as a person, I just can't let it affect me. Obviously, it's not always fun, you know, it is hard to hear 24/7 that your partner's a player or you're crazy, you're brainwashed, all the awful things that people say because they don't understand. They obviously don't know the ins and outs, they don't know the details. They don't understand how we do things and why it works. Nor do I care to explain any of that. So I never will.’ Having first been approached to join the show in 2020, Bre finally felt the time was right to film last year, despite having given birth six weeks before filming started. It was a wrench to be away from her son, not least because she was breastfeeding and determined to continue. Indeed, during one scene in series six, episode two, Bre uses a breastpump at her desk. This was an intentional move, to do it on camera. ‘I felt like it was really my identity, especially in that moment, this was something I was really going through,' she shared. '[It was] something that was so new to me, and something that as women, we’re often shamed for doing what is completely natural. Yeah. And as everyone can tell, I don’t live my life the way people want me to. So I wanted to be very open with my [breastfeeding] journey, and how I felt about it, and that it’s okay, and we should be embraced. And I’m not going to go either in a room to feed my child or a bathroom or any of those places, and you have a problem with it. I do not care. It was very important for me.’ The rest of the team, said Bre, was very supportive, and she has grown particularly close with [Chrishell Stause](https://graziadaily.co.uk/celebrity/news/chrishell-stause-interview/) and [Emma Hernan](https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/tv-and-film/emma-hernan-selling-sunset-age-boyfriend-vegan-business/), however she’s openly not a fan of Chelsea or Nicole Young. And (like the rest of us) she is slightly confused by the appeal of [Jason Oppenheim](https://graziadaily.co.uk/celebrity/news/jason-oppenheim-regrets-selling-sunset-2/), who has dated three of the agents on the show: Chrishell, Nicole and [Mary Fitzgerald](https://graziadaily.co.uk/celebrity/news/selling-sunset-mary-romain/). ‘It's very funny to me. I don't necessarily understand it,' said Bre, laughing. 'But you know, most of the girls work well together. They're not bothered. I'm not bothered. He collects quality women. That's what Jason does!’ Of course no Selling Sunset agent would fit in without an impossibly tiny and expensive wardrobe, and Bre admitted that she came prepared to serve looks. She says she had a ‘business forward’ brief on her moodboard she worked on with her stylist (though it’s hard to imagine anyone dressing like these women do for any other day job). It’s part of the camp fun though! Bre agreed, ‘I’m obsessed with fashion, and there is pressure to bring the outfits and dress a certain kind of way.’ She admits that she works with a stylist, though not all of them do. ‘I tried to really channel how I would actually dress at the office with a little bit of flair and how I would dress out in public, but also how I would dress my postpartum body.’ We have no doubt that series eight of Selling Sunset will be bigger and better than ever - especially when it comes to the outfits. And the drama of course!",

    "text": "Sulphur teacher wins Milken Educator Award\nLAKE CHARLES, La. (KPLC) - Maplewood Middle School’s band director Kyle Cook received a big surprise today for his achievements as an educator.\nCook was one of three recipients in the state to receive the Milken Educator Award, which was created in 1987 in California to celebrate, elevate and activate the teaching profession.\nCook says he wasn’t expecting to be recognized.\n“We were told today would just be an assembly,” Cook said. “We knew we had some special guests coming and it was going to be a great time.”\nHe said he was filled with emotion the moment he heard his name announced.\n“I’m just very grateful. I’ve been here for a long time and I’ve loved this school. I’ve loved working with all my kids and just to see something like this - it recognizes the hard work my kids do,” said Cook.\nThis recognition comes with an unrestricted financial award of $25,000.\nCook, who is originally from Texas, moved to Lake Charles for college, and has been at Maplewood Middle since he graduated. He says he’s always known teaching was his destiny, but it wasn’t until high school that he realized it was also his passion.\n“There were so many different avenues out there and then when I went to high school, I thought, ‘Okay, who has given me the most impact on my life?’ It was my band directors,” Cook said.\nMusic gave him a purpose, he said and band provided him with a place to succeed. He says his hope is to provide students with the opportunities he had as a student in school.\n“To me, it creates good humans, good people, good citizens, all these different things that teach them hard work, how to be responsible, how to be respectful, overall just how to be good people of society,” said Cook.\nCook will travel to California in April to accept the award. He will also be honored as Louisiana Jazz Educator of the Year in January in New Orleans.\nTo learn more about the Milken Educator Award, click [here](https://www.milkeneducatorawards.org/about/fact-sheet/).\nCopyright 2024 KPLC.

Подъехав для проверки, они обнаружили в салоне двоих иностранцев за обедом. Рядом с транспортным средством лежали пустые мешки, лопата и была заметна недавно выкопанная яма. При осмотре автомобиля в нем нашли два мешка с корнями ясенца мохнатоплодного. Растение занесено в Красную Книгу Амурской области, его сбор запрещен, — сообщили в управлении по охране животного мира Амурской области.\nПрибывшие на место полицейские изъяли у нарушителей незаконную добычу. Иностранцы были переданы в миграционную службу, им грозит депортация. Помимо этого, копателям предстоит ответить перед законом и возместить ущерб за вред, нанесенный природе региона.\nПо данным охотуправления, это первый случай незаконной добычи корней ясенца на территории Приамурья. Как правило, копатели начинают интересоваться редким растением ближе к осени.\nВозрастная категория материалов: 18+",
