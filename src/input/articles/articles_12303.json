    "text": "Results for 2023’s new vehicle market show that although Ford has firmly lost its crown overall it can still proudly claim to produce the UK’s biggest-selling car and van.\nAnd it did so during the year when it announced the long-lived Fiesta supermini would cease to be produced. Fiesta was often the UK’s biggest seller for many years, but in 2023 it was the Ford Puma SUV which topped the table. It accounted for one in three Ford new cars sold in 2023.\nFord of Britain managing director Lisa Brankin said: “I’m delighted that Puma was both the bestselling vehicle and car in the UK and Transit Custom was the bestselling commercial vehicle in 2023. This terrific achievement in 2023 is a great foundation for us to build on as we step forward into 2024 and roll out our electrification plan at pace in both the car and van markets.”\nAudi UK ended 2023 as the UK’s number one premium car brand – the third consecutive year the brand has achieved this feat. A total of 137,489 new vehicle sales placed the brand third overall in the new car charts with a market share of 7.22% – a record figure for Audi UK.\nHowever its best-selling model, the A3, was ninth most in-demand in the UK.\nIt is Tesla which could lay claim to selling the most popular premium car. The Tesla Model Y was the UK’s 5th most sold new car overall, and it outsold Audi’s A3 by more than 5,000 units.\nThe Tesla Model Y was the most popular battery electric vehicle (BEV) of 2023, outselling its nearest rival, the MG4, by more than 50%. The Tesla Model 3 also sold strongly, with 13,536 registrations keeping it narrowly ahead of the Polestar 2.\nIn the van market, Ford continues to dominate, with Transit Custom then the Transit. Its Ranger pick-up and Transit Connect also feature in the top 10 best sellers.\nVauxhall was the UK’s best-selling electric van manufacturer in 2023, selling 6,402 electric vans – more than double its nearest competitor. The success of Vauxhall’s electric vans as private and fleet vehicles means that more than a quarter (29.8%) of electric light commercial vehicles (e-LCVs) registered in 2023 was a Vauxhall.\nVauxhall is one of few brands to offer an electric variant across its entire LCV line-up. In 2023, nearly a fifth (18.5%) of Vauxhall’s overall van sales were of fully electric variants.\n- SEO Powered Content & PR Distribution.\nGet Amplified Today.\n- PlatoData.Network Vertical Generative Ai.

    "text": "A Dazzling Birthday Performance\nIvica Zubac turned his 28th birthday into a showcase of skill as he led the Clippers to a commanding 132-119 win over a high-achieving Cavaliers team at the Intuit Dome. His standout performance, marked by 28 points and 20 rebounds, proved pivotal in outplaying the opposing big men in a match that highlighted both his personal milestone and his importance to the team.\nDominance on the Court\nThe Clippers’ victory was powered by Zubac’s exceptional play. Since the All-Star break, his averages have reached 20.5 points and 12.4 rebounds per game, reflecting consistent improvement and growing influence in crucial moments. His dual contribution on offense and defense showcased the kind of effort capable of reshaping the team’s fortunes, particularly as they work to climb out of the lower playoff spots.\nCelebration and Peer Recognition\nFollowing his impressive display, Zubac celebrated the occasion on social media with a heartfelt message that resonated with his 164,000 followers. The response from teammates and fellow players was swift and supportive. Comments from notable figures underscored the respect he has earned across the league, emphasizing his role as a key contributor and a well-liked presence both on and off the court.\nA Bright Future Ahead\nNow in his seventh season with the Clippers, Zubac’s development continues to fuel optimism about the team’s prospects. His recent performance not only bolstered the victory over the Cavaliers but also reinvigorated the squad’s bid to climb the standings and move beyond the play-in tournament. As he carries both the joy of a personal milestone and the weight of expectations, his journey embodies the promise of growth and leadership for the future.",
