    "text": "VANCOUVER, BC – December 5, 2024 – The Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada (APF Canada) is pleased to announce its two Media Fellowship recipients for 2024-25.\nEach year, the APF Canada Media Fellowship Program offers Canadian journalists the opportunity to spend time in Asia researching and preparing stories for Canadian audiences. The goal of the program is to help Canadian journalists become better informed about this dynamic part of the world to write and broadcast insightfully on Asia and the Canada-Asia relationship.\nThe program has supported 98 Canadian journalists since its inception in 1986.\nAPF Canada’s $10,000 2024-25 Media Fellowships are awarded to Cathy Senay and Carla Bragagnini.\n- Cathy Senay has been a CBC/Radio-Canada journalist for more than 23 years. Based in Québec City, Québec, she has covered legislative and current affairs and produced in-depth stories on military affairs as well as investigative projects. Cathy’s APF Canada Media Fellowship will take her to Japan to explore that country’s use of industrial and humanoid robots to meet the demographic challenges of a shrinking workforce and aging population. Seeking lessons for Canada, which faces similar demographic shifts, she will focus on the renewable energy, education, and senior care sectors.\n- Carla Bragagnini is a freelance travel writer, journalist, and multimedia specialist with 13 years’ experience as an editorial contributor. Based in Montreal, Québec, her work has appeared in long-form publications in Canada, the U.K., New Zealand, and Germany. Carla’s APF Canada Media Fellowship will take her to Nepal, Japan, and Vietnam to document the preservation of cultural artisanal practices and products. With the aim of inspiring Canadians to prioritize value in the origins and craftmanship of their consumer products, she will focus on the ways in which small-scale producers and makers in Asia can positively impact global consumption.\nFor more details on the APF Canada Media Fellowship Program and how to apply, please follow [this link](https://www.asiapacific.ca/grants/media-fellowships).\n-30-\nVisit APF Canada at [www.asiapacific.ca](http://www.asiapacific.ca/)\nFollow us on X [@AsiaPacificFdn](https://twitter.com/AsiaPacificFdn) and [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/company/apfcanada)",

JOHN'S, N.L. — A brawny nor'easter dumped up to 37 centimetres of snow on Nova Scotia on Wednesday before trudging to Newfoundland, where the wind picked up and a swirling snowfall enveloped much of the province. Across the top of eastern and northeastern Newfoundland, up to 60 cm of snow was expected in communities from St. John's in the east to the Bay of Exploits in the west, and the winds along the coast were expected to gust at 100 kilometres per hour until Thursday night.

In one of the latest examples of senseless vandalism in the community, the coin box on the standpipe in Pincher Creek was damaged last week in an obvious attempt to get money from the sealed unit.
