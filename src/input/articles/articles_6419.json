    "text": "A car salesman from Rufino, Santa Fe, was found murdered and his body burned inside his truck on December 4 in General Villegas, in the northwest of the Province of Buenos Aires. Investigators led investigators to four men, three of them brothers, who were arrested on charges of killing the victim to avenge the death of a fourth brother two years ago.\nAccording to investigators, the suspects would have simulated the sale of an air conditioner for which they ambushed Diego Pablo Mendicoff . Those arrested are Miguel Alejandro Gamboa, alias \"Rulo\"; Darío Ricardo Gamboa; Mauro Antonio Gamboa, alias \"Topo\"; and Daniel Aparicio Varela, alias \"Guri,\" who were placed at the disposal of the Justice and will be questioned in the next few hours.\nMendicoff had been a truck driver and was now selling cars and buying grain. He agreed with \"Rulo\" Gamboa to buy an air conditioner and went to the agreed place with his Toyota Hilux.\nAccording to sources, investigators believe that when the men were talking, two of Gamboa's brothers who were in hiding, pounced on the victim, subdued him and hit him the head .\nAccording to investigators, with the complicity of a fourth man, \"Guri\" Varela, the three Gamboa brothers transported Mendicoff's body in their truck about 100 kilometers to the side of a rural road in the town of Cañada Seca, in General Villegas.\nThere, the suspects allegedly set fire to the Hilux with the victim's body inside, which ended up burning, while the brothers escaped in the Citroën C3 driven by Varela.\nThree brothers and a fourth man were arrested on charges of murdering a car salesman in the Santa Fe city of Rufino, whose body was found burned on Dec. 4 inside a pickup truck on a rural road in General Villegas. Photo: Télam\nAn investigator said that one of the hypotheses of the crime was an alleged revenge of the Gamboa brothers against Mendicoff, who was blamed for the death of another member of their family.\n\"Two years ago, the victim was allegedly a truck driver and in those circumstances he picked up a fourth brother of the Gamboas on a road. That brother was found dead in the Rosario area and these brothers always blamed him for his death,\" an investigator told Telam .\nThe same source indicated that Mendicoff continued to be in contact with \"Rulo\" Gamboa, \"with whom he did business eventually,\" and to whom he had warned that at that time he had transferred the brother to Rosario, he said.\nProsecutor Manuel Iglesias, of the Functional Investigation Unit (UFI) 5 of Trenque Lauquen, began investigating Mendicoff's crime, which led to two first arrests of Miguel Gamboa and Daniel Varela.\nInvestigators believe Mendicoff's crime was a sibling vendetta. Photo: Télam\nAgents of the Departmental Delegation of Investigations (DDI) of Trenque Lauquen continued with the collection of evidence and based on witness testimonies the participation of the other two Gamboa brothers, Darío and Mauro Gamboa, who were arrested in the last hours after a series of raids carried out in the city of Rufino, was also determined. with the intervention of the DDI of Trenque Lauquen and the Santa Fe police.\nA .22 caliber Bersa pistol was seized during the proceedings, among other items of interest to the case.\nThe detainees will be questioned in the next few hours by prosecutor Iglesias for the crimes of \"qualified homicide by treachery and in premeditated competition of 2 or more people\", which provides for a sentence of life imprisonment.\nMG",

    "text": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ordered the \"mass production\" of attack drones, state media reported Friday, as concerns mount over the country's deepening military cooperation with Russia.\nPyongyang first unveiled its attack drones in August, with experts saying the capability may be attributable to the country's budding alliance with Russia.\nThe nuclear-armed country has ratified a landmark defence pact with Moscow and is accused of deploying thousands of troops to Russia to support its war in Ukraine, prompting South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol to warn about the potential transfer of sensitive Russian military technology to North Korea.\nKim on Thursday oversaw the tests of drones designed to hit both land and sea targets, produced by North Korea's Unmanned Aerial Technology Complex, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.\n\"He underscored the need to build a serial production system as early as possible and go into full-scale mass production,\" KCNA said.\nThe unmanned drones are designed to carry explosives and be deliberately crashed into enemy targets, effectively acting as guided missiles.\nThursday's test saw the drones \"precisely\" hit targets after flying along predetermined paths, KCNA reported.\n\"The suicide attack drones to be used within different striking ranges are to perform a mission to precisely attack any enemy targets on the ground and in the sea,\" the agency said.\nKim said the drones were an \"easy to use... component of striking power\" due to their relatively low production cost and expansive range of applications, according to KCNA.\nHe said the North had \"recently attached importance\" to developing unmanned hardware systems and to integrating them with the country's overall military strategy.\n- Russian tech? - Experts said the drones -- in images released by state media in August -- looked similar to the Israeli-made \"HAROP\" drone, Russian-made \"Lancet-3\" and Israeli \"HERO 30\".\nMore from this section EU deforestation ban in chaos as parliament loosens rules Burberry launches turnaround plan as posts loss EU unity in a 'world on fire': Kallas makes top diplomat pitch North Korea may have acquired these technologies from Russia, which in turn likely obtained them from Iran -- with Tehran itself suspected of accessing them through hacking or theft from Israel.\nIn 2022, Pyongyang sent drones across the border that Seoul's military was unable to shoot down, saying they were too small.\nThis year, North Korea has been bombarding the South with trash-carrying balloons, in what it calls retaliation for activists in the South floating anti-regime propaganda missives northwards.\nThe North has also accused Seoul of violating its sovereignty by flying drones over its capital Pyongyang to drop propaganda leaflets.\nBy mentioning the \"production and practical deployment of various drones\", North Korea may be hinting it could follow suit, Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told AFP.\nPyongyang could be \"suggesting the possibility of using balloons to disseminate leaflets to the South with such drones,\" Yang said.\n\"Considering the effectiveness of drone attacks observed in the war in Ukraine, they could also be effectively utilised in the ongoing conflict there,\" he added.\nSouth Korea launched a drone operation command last year to better address the growing threat.\nIn October, the North amended its constitution to define South Korea as a \"hostile\" state, an illustration of a sharp deterioration in ties since Kim in January declared Seoul his country's \"principal enemy\".\nThe North has continued to carry out UN sanctions-defying ballistic missile tests, and last month blew up its roads and railways linking it to the South.\ncdl/ceb/tym\nX Thank you for visiting!\nYou have two articles remaining.\nTry one month for free or subscribe today.\nFree Trial Subscribe\nAlready a subscriber?

    "title": "LG unveils new AI robot 'companion' that promises to boost your mood | Tom's Guide",
    "text": "LG is kicking off its CES extravaganza with a new robot that promises to turn your smart home into a “Zero Labor Home.”\nThe admittedly cute LG robot is about a foot tall and moves on two legs, allowing it to patrol your home for issues, watch your pet and even read your emotions to ensure it gives you a better overall at-home experience. And with help from Qualcomm’s Robotics RB5 Platform , it uses artificial intelligence to learn your interests and behaviors, and get better over time at serving as a friendly home robot.\nIn a statement , LG called its robot a “moving smart home hub” and said that it’s designed to “free customers from household chores.” And at first blush, it seems to do just that.\nThe robot, which will debut at CES 2024 next week, is able to connect to all of your smart home devices and even switch them off if they’re not in use or you’re not home. And speaking of when you’re not home, the device is capable of moving from room to room to identify whether windows are closed or lights are on and send you notifications to let you know.\nAdditionally, LG said that its robot is intelligent enough to monitor your pets while you’re away and allow you to access real-time video to see what they’re up to when you’re not home. And just in case you’re worried about your furnace not working, the robot can analyze your home’s temperature, humidity and indoor air quality, and let you know when something is awry.\nHelpful or creepy?\n(Image credit: LG) But it’s when you return home that the cute little robot turns, well, a bit creepy. According to LG, its device can greet you at the door and will analyze your face, the sound of your voice, and other information to assess your emotional state. It’ll then play music or other audio to boost your mood. Oh, and if you happen to be someone who forgets your medication schedule, it can keep that in line, too.\nIn order to achieve all this, LG’s robot has a host of components, including a camera, speaker and sensors that can help it assess indoor air quality and other things going on around the house. And with help from voice- and image-recognition software, along with natural language processing, it can identify problems as they happen.\nThe robot is part of a broader push by LG to expand its smart home lineup with products that take you out of the equation. Indeed, the robot is just one of what LG has promised would be a steady lineup of devices that aim at that Zero Labor Home concept.\nBut whether you’ll want to have a robot following you (and your dog) around the house all day is hard to say. LG plans to showcase the robot at its CES booth next week. The company didn’t reveal pricing or availability.",
