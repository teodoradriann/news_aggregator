    "text": "SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California. The 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared. “I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said. He was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors. It would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found. “So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled. It was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost. “I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.” The problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going. By the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report. The search was on then. “Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said. Lukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal. “‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.” But on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help. The Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location. A K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family. “Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.” Fortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.

    "text": "WASHINGTON, 1 FEV (ANSA) - O presidente americano, Joe Biden, impôs sanções financeiras e bloqueio de visto a quatro colonos israelenses na Cisjordânia que atacaram palestinos. Segundo a ordem executiva assinada pelo presidente, os colonos estavam envolvidos em atos de violência, ameaças e tentativas de destruir ou se apropriar de propriedades palestinas. A medida estabelece bases para ações contra ataques e atos considerados terroristas na Cisjordânia. Ao tomar a decisão, Biden disse que a violência atingiu \"níveis intoleráveis\". \"A situação na Cisjordânia, com níveis particularmente altos de violência por parte dos colonos extremistas, despejos forçados e destruição de propriedades, atingiu níveis intoleráveis e constitui uma séria ameaça à paz, segurança e estabilidade da Cisjordânia e Gaza, de Israel e de todo o Oriente Médio\", destacou Joe Biden. Em resposta, o primeiro-ministro de Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, declarou: \"Não há motivo para adotar medidas extraordinárias. A grande maioria dos residentes na Judeia e Samaria (Cisjordânia) são cidadãos respeitosos da lei. \"Atualmente os residentes estão engajados na defesa de Israel, tanto nas unidades de serviço militar quanto entre os reservistas. Israel age contra aqueles que quebram a lei, em qualquer lugar\", afirmou. O ministro da Segurança Nacional e líder da direita radical, Itamar Ben-Gvir, afirmou: \"O presidente Joe Biden está errado em relação aos cidadãos de Israel e aos seus heroicos colonos\". (ANSA).

    "text": "A warming trend is in the forecast for much of British Columbia after several days of record-breaking temperatures, but the cold weather on the Prairies will continue. Environment Canada says temperatures are rising but snow flurries are in the forecast for the Metro Vancouver area, followed by rain later this week and temperatures well above zero degrees Celsius. Temperatures in Alberta are forecast to start to moderate today and through the week, but it will remain cold. Calgary and Edmonton have been experiencing wind chills as high as -50 C over the weekend, but Environment Canada says the daily low temperatures will drop to -21 C. Environment Canada says despite the somewhat warmer temperatures in Alberta, frostbite warnings will remain in effect. B.C.'s public power utility, BC Hydro, says the extreme cold drove peak hourly electricity demand across the province to a record high on Friday night, reaching 11,300 megawatts.

    "text": "By Paul Vieira\nOTTAWA--The U.K. said on Thursday it would pause negotiations with Canada on a comprehensive liberalized-trade treaty, citing a lack of progress. Canada said talks stalled over agriculture, and British reluctance to increase market access for the Canadian agrifood sector.\n\"We reserve the right to pause negotiations with any country if progress is not being made,\" according to a statement from the U.K. government, published on the social-media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, by the High Commissioner to Canada. The statement added that the U.K. would be willing to restart talks with Canada, so long as it benefits businesses and consumers \"on both sides of the Atlantic.\"\nThe statement didn't elaborate on why talks, launched in March 2022, broke down. A spokesman at the U.K. High Commission in Ottawa declined further comment.\nMeanwhile, a spokeswoman for Canadian Trade Minister Mary Ng said Britain's decision to \"maintain market-access barriers for our agriculture industry and unwillingness to reach a mutual agreement has only stalled negotiations.\"\nThe spokeswoman added Canada is confident that a deal can eventually be reached.\nCanadian agrifood groups, such as the Canadian Pork Council, had testified before lawmakers last year that what was being proposed in talks between London and Ottawa wouldn't increase access for their products in the British market. Meanwhile, Britain was seeking increased access in Canada for its domestic cheese producers.\nIn November 2020, to much fanfare, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and former U.K. leader Boris Johnson announced an interim trade pact to take effect in 2021, once Britain was no longer part of a European Union-Canada trade treaty. At that time, Trudeau and U.K. officials pledged to work toward a more comprehensive trade agreement.\nCanadian government data covering 2022 indicate that the U.K. was Canada's third-largest trading partner, with trade in goods and services valued at 46.5 billion Canadian dollars, or the equivalent of US$34.4 billion.\nWrite to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n01-25-24 1653ET\nShare © Dow Jones - 2024",
