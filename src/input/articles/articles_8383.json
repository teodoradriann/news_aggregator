    "text": "Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has assured residents of Bangkok that fears of flooding are unfounded, emphasising that current rainwater levels are significantly lower compared to the devastating 2011 floods. On Wednesday, Ms. Paetongtarn reviewed the water situation at the Royal Irrigation Department in Nonthaburi.\nIn 2011, Thailand faced the fury of five storms and saw a rainfall increase of over 25% beyond the average. In contrast, this year's figures show only a 2% rise above usual rainfall levels, and just one storm has struck. Major reservoirs still have room to retain water, unlike in 2011 when they reached capacity, forcing massive water releases.\n\"For those concerned about potential flooding in Bangkok , there is no need to worry. Bangkok will not be flooded,\" assured Ms. Paetongtarn.\nCurrently, rainfall in northern areas is contributing to water flow from the Ping, Wang, Yom, and Nan rivers into the Chao Phraya River. The Chao Phraya Dam in Chai Nat is releasing water at 1,899 cubic metres per second, a rate comfortably managed by current infrastructure.\nThe Water Resources Department is closely monitoring at the Bang Sai station to ensure flow rates remain under 3,000 cubic metres per second in Ayutthaya.\nLocal authorities are prepared, deploying drainage and pumping efforts to direct water efficiently to the Gulf of Thailand, managing a daily capacity of about 164 million cubic metres, reported Bangkok Post.\nLooking ahead, the Meteorological Department forecasts mixed weather, with possible storms and rainfall due to a cold front from China, affecting Bangkok, among other regions.\nMeanwhile, Jirayu Houngsub, a disaster relief spokesman, warned of potential overflow along Chiang Rai's Kok River due to expected heavy rains, potentially impacting 147 square kilometres across six districts.\nPicture courtesy: Thai Rath\n-- 2024-10-04",

[Watch]: Virat Kohli dances hilariously to celebrate Travis Head's dismissal for a duck on Day 1 of 4th BGT 2024-25 Test Discuss Now Virat Kohli (left) celebrates the wicket of Travis Head (Image Credits: Getty Images) Senior Team India batter Virat Kohli came up with a hilarious dance to celebrate Travis Head's dismissal on Day 1 of the Boxing Day Test against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Thursday, December 26. Head was dismissed for a seven-ball duck by Jasprit Bumrah.\nBatting first after winning the toss, Australia posted 311-6 in 86 overs on Day 1 of the MCG Test. Debutant Sam Konstas (19) smashed 60 off 65 balls, while Usman Khawaja (57), Marnus Labuschagne (72) and Steven Smith (68*) also struck fifties.\nBumrah led a strong fightback for India after Australia's excellent start. He ended Khawaja's stay at the crease before dismissing the dangerous Head for a duck. The Aussie left-hander shouldered arms to a delivery from Bumrah , bowled from around the wicket. He made a complete error of judgment as the ball ended up hitting his off stump.\nTrending As the Indian players gathered to celebrate the huge wicket of Head, Kohli was seen doing a hilarious dance. He stretched both his arms wide and started moving them in a rather comical manner. [Watch video below]\nAfter sending back Head, Bumrah also dismissed Mitchell Marsh for four. The right-handed batter attempted a pull off the Indian pacer, but only managed to edge the ball to the keeper. Akash Deep then chipped in with the wicket of Australian keeper-batter Alex Carey (31) as the left-handed batter nicked a peach of a delivery outside off behind the wickets.",

    "text": "During this time of year, many of us start getting dry hands and whilst it may not be an issue for some, for other it can be quite painful especially if they are in a job where they need to keep washing their hands.\nThankfully though,\nAmazon shoppers have come across one cream that is helping to tackle this issue. And it comes in at a budget-friendly price. Costing under a tenner, the O'Keeffe's Working Hands Eczema Relief Hand Cream is said to ‘work miracles’ on dry, cracked hands and not only that, it's hailed as being good for skin conditions like eczema.\nWhile there are many moisturising products on the market that are designed to combat\ndry hands, especially during this time of year, many shoppers have shared that this works better than any they have tried before.\nREAD MORE:\nAmazon eczema 'miracle' cream that costs £9 perfect for cold weather\nREAD MORE:\nMarks and Spencer's £14 oodie alternative that has people 'turning off heating'\nThe\nO'Keeffe's Working Hands Eczema Relief Hand Cream is priced at £9.49 and comes in a 57g tube marketed for those with 'extremely dry, itchy, irritated hands'. Designed for daily use specifically to treat dry hand conditions, this cream is steroid-free, dermatologically tested and is said to give the wearer 48 hours of itch relief in one use.\nOn the\nAmazon website, the product listing states: “Our formula provides 48-hour itch relief in just 1 use, leaving your skin feeling soft and comfortable. It locks in moisture, instantly hydrates & replenishes moisture levels, resulting in skin that feels soft, and comfortable, with a visibly improved appearance.”\nAnd with an overall star rating 4.7 out of 5 stars on its website from a whopping 83,839 ratings, shoppers seem to be loving the magic this cream seems to work. One shopper wrote: “Working outside a lot during the winter my hands would frequently dry out to the point the skin would crack and bleed. This stuff fixed them right up. My hands are softer and my skin no longer resembles an abused Iguana. I would highly recommend it.”\nAnother, who claimed it was a miracle worker, said: “O'Keeffe's Working Hands Cream is a true hand-saving miracle in a jar. As someone who frequently deals with dry, cracked skin due to constant handwashing and exposure to harsh weather, this cream has been a game-changer. Its non-greasy, quick-absorbing formula means you can apply it and get back to work without leaving a residue on everything you touch.\"\nSign up to our daily Edinburgh Live\nnewsletter here to receive news and features direct to your inbox\nA third penned: “I have eczema in my hands. I've tried every lotion and hand cream possible. This is it! It's super lightweight, easily absorbed, and makes my hands smooth and keeps the itchiness away! Will definitely order more.\"\nAnd a fourth shared: “I get very dry, cracked hands with small cuts and splits from working as a chef. This cream works miracles. Stings a little bit when on an open split but heals them up so quickly and gets rid of the dryness after one use. Won't be using anything else going forward.”\n- Try your 30 day free Amazon Prime trial\nHERE\nWhile many loved the product , there were some who found it hard to get on with, claiming it to be too sticky or greasy. One shopper said: “Used this before and didn't like it but that was a few years ago. I thought it may be better but it hasn't changed. It's soft but you can feel it on your hands the next day.”\nAnd another said: “Whilst it does make your skin soft, it leaves a residue all over your hands, meaning it's only really good before you go to bed.”\nIf you want to try the\nO'Keeffe's hand cream but don’t want to wait for delivery then Boots has the exact same hand cream which also costs £9.49. Or if you’re not looking to spend that much then there are cheaper options including the Garnier Intensive 7 Day Shea Butter hand cream which costs £3.33.",

And things have kind of turned around.” Although the Real Housewives of New York City alum is on the prowl, she denied that Mary-Kate Olsen’s ex-husband, Sarkozy, was one of her recent love interests. (Olsen, 37, and Sarkozy, 54, wed in 2015. The actress signed a petition for divorce in April 2020, but the proceedings were paused during the COVID-19 shutdowns. They finalized the separation in January 2021.) De Lesseps confirmed to Us that she did go “out to lunch” with Sarkozy last month, which is when she was photographed walking arm-in-arm with the French banker. “It was fun. I’ve known him for a while,” she explained, noting that their March outing to New York City’s Le Bilboquet was innocent. “It’s kind of more of a friendship.” Two months prior, the reality star sparked romance speculation with Southern Hospitality’s Bradley, 27. “We got along very well,” de Lesseps teased to Us about her connection with Bradley. “We had a good chemistry together.” Us broke the news in January that de Lesseps and Bradley were “all over each other” at NYC’s The Dream Hotel after taping an episode of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen together.
