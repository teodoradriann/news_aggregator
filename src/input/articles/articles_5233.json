(WIS) - Residents across the Midlands are reacting to the damage done following Wednesday morning storms.\nFairfield County has seen some damage from severe weather.\nWIS News 10 spoke with a gas station in Ridgeway, one who said a new roof flew off the building into the ground.\nVictor Sherman said the new roof was about three to four years old.\n“This happened around 8’o’clock. I was inside the store, I just heard one ‘boom!’” Sherman said.\nSherman said he was inside his business when the roof blew off.\n“As soon as I go on that side, I see the whole roof was down,” Sherman.\nAfter losing his roof, heavy rain got in and damaged the business' ceiling tiles and insulation.\nSherman said he is facing the possibility of closing up shop for a few days if he wants it to get fixed before the next time it rains.\n“It’s really going to hurt. Lease is going to be the same, bills are going to be the same. We’re going to have to shut down for a couple of days. It’s Mother Nature. You can’t fight with that,” Sherman said.\nThroughout the county residents were woken up by the sound of strong winds and heavy rain.\n“I mean I didn’t clock it but still it was ferocious,” said Gena McCoy\nThe winds in the county were gusting to about 40 miles per hour.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, this was likely caused by straight line winds. And says they’ve had no other reports of damage in the county.\nFeel more informed, prepared, and connected with WIS.

    "title": "Josh Allen wishes Stefon Diggs 'nothing but the best', has his eyes set on future of Bills' offense",
    "text": "The first phase of offseason activities has begun at One Bills Drive and players are back in the building for voluntary workouts which started Monday. QB Josh Allen and head coach Sean McDermott spoke to the media on their impressions of how the offseason has gone so far. Here's what we learned. Allen: Wishing Diggs 'nothing but the best' Over the last four seasons, Josh Allen and Stefon Diggs have been synonymous with the most prolific QB/WR duo in the NFL. 2024 will mark a new chapter for each player as Allen adjusts to life without his WR1 after the Texans acquired Diggs via a trade in early April. \"It's definitely hard to part ways with a guy that's been very instrumental in our success here over the last four years. And again, I can't thank him enough for when he came in and how hard he worked and what he taught me along the years,\" Allen said Thursday. When Allen learned the trade had been finalized, he reached out to Diggs to express his gratitude for the success and friendship they shared as teammates. \"I shared a text with him and got one back, and just thanking him for everything that he did for me and always have a spot in my heart for him. And I'll always love that guy like a brother. And I wish him nothing but the best,\" he said. With Diggs, a veteran presence in the clubhouse, no longer in Buffalo, Allen believes that it's up to him and other players on the team to fill that leadership void. \"I think it's an opportunity for myself to grow as a leader. And to bring along some of these young guys and new guys that we've brought into our team. And that's an opportunity, frankly, that I'm very excited about. It's something that's going to be very challenging, but I'm very willing to do it,\" Allen shared. Allen, who will be entering his seventh NFL season, is a perennial MVP candidate. He led the league in touchdowns last season and helped the Bills win the AFC East for a fourth-straight year. The QB understands that high level of year-in-year-out success puts him — and the Bills — under a microscope when it comes to team chemistry. \"You're not getting paid just to be the quarterback. You're getting paid to be the best leader that you can be, the best quarterback obviously comes with that,\" Allen said. \"So leadership looks like a lot of different things. You wear many hats in this building. You know, and sometimes, it's not the easiest thing, and especially when I feel like I'm one of the guys and sometimes I have to remind myself that you're looked at a little bit differently.\" He added, \"Guys are relying on you a little bit more and understanding that but trusting the coaching staff, trusting your teammates around you. And having that type of humility, where it's like, you're able to say when and where you're wrong. And I think that's what we've learned over the last few years, not just with (Diggs) but with other receivers and with other players as well.\" Youth movement 'not a bad thing' for Bills offense The beginning of the offseason workout program is where the foundation is laid for the Bills' identity for the fall. For the Buffalo offense, it's been about building around a young core. As it stands, Buffalo's active roster does not have an offensive player over the age of 30 (La'el Collins turns 31 in July). \"I don't think it's a wrong thing or a bad thing to get younger,\" Allen said. \"I think that, as a coaching staff, as a leader, to be able to come in and kind of mold these guys into the team that you want to be, I think there's a very exciting opportunity.\" Allen will also get to work alongside one of the NFL's youngest offensive coordinators in Joe Brady. This first week of offseason workouts has offered a glimpse into what Brady's vision for the offense will be. So far, Allen's indication is that it's going the right way. \"Already just going through different concepts and the little tweaks here or there,\" he said. \"Starting my eyes here, progressing through here, instead of maybe being — like it's a little technical — but talking to other quarterbacks, it's like why weren't we doing this before?\" One thing that stood out to Allen last season when Brady was the interim OC was the level of involvement everyone had in deciding which plays the offense executed the best. The QB expects that to continue to be a key part of the system. \"His big philosophy is, if you guys want it, if that's something you want, you're going to make it work,\" he shared. \"And again, he wants to call the plays that work. And when guys are convicted about a certain concept or a certain play, it's typically going to work out in our favor.\" \"Our focus has been where it needs to be\" With a handful of veterans departing during free agency, Bills head coach Sean McDermott understands it will be a challenge to replace both their leadership and on-field production. That challenge also extends to the coaching staff which saw five new full-time hires and promotions for Joe Brady (OC) and Bobby Babich (DC). After just one week, McDermott has been impressed with the collaboration and teamwork from both the players and staff. \"We're just getting started, right? I think our focus has been where it needs to be. That's starting with what's right in front of us and our offseason program,\" McDermott said. The head coach shared that about 95% of the team has reported to One Bills Drive for the voluntary workouts that began Monday, which he stated is a \"very high\" number. \"The participation has been great, the energy has been great. Guys getting to know one another, and building that love, that respect,\" McDermott said. \"That leads into them being ready to hold each other accountable or just that shared accountability, which is as you know big for us.\" As far as finding elevated leadership roles for current players, McDermott shared that he and the coaching staff have between 10-15 players they've identified as guys who could take that next step. The voluntary offseason workouts, along with OTAs and Mandatory Minicamp will be times where that development takes place. \"We have some guys already in mind that will step up and will have to stretch themselves to get out of their comfort zone a little bit, and that comes with developing as a leader and putting yourself in those positions. The more you do it, the better you get at it,\" McDermott said. Does Allen have a say in Bills draft selection? We're one week away from the 2024 NFL Draft and the Bills are starting to put the final touches on their draft board. As the first round gets closer don't be surprised if Brandon Beane gets a call or text from pseudo GM Josh Allen. \"I look at all the highlight tapes on YouTube, so everyone's a baller on those highlights,\" Allen laughed. \"But going down and actually watching all their targets and seeing their mannerisms. And obviously I'm not there in the personnel meetings. But I get a lot of intel from the guys up in the bullpen.\" Joking aside, Allen shared that he truly loves the NFL Draft process, recalling his constant anxious headache he had on Draft Day waiting for his name to be called. He also remembers sending Beane a text on the day of last year's draft that simply read 'Dalton Kincaid', a mild suggestion on his Day 1 draft preference that ended up coming to fruition. However, Allen doesn't expect that to be the norm. \"I'd like to think that I have some input in who we get to pick, but honestly, I really don't,\" he said.

    "title": "Sharp rise in religious hate crimes recorded by UK’s largest police forces | Eastern Daily Press",
    "text": "The number of antisemitic hate crimes recorded by many of the UK’s largest police forces jumped sharply in the weeks following the outbreak of the Hamas-Israel conflict, new figures reveal. Islamophobic offences also rose for some forces, although the picture was more mixed across the country. Jewish charities called the findings “shocking”, while campaigners against anti-Muslim abuse said the data was “deeply worrying”. The Home Office condemned the rise in offences, adding: “There is no place for hate in our society.” The figures have been obtained by the PA news agency using Freedom of Information requests. They show that: – Greater Manchester Police recorded 74 antisemitic offences in the month following the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, compared with 15 for the same period in 2022 and 14 in 2021, while West Yorkshire Police recorded 53, compared with 10 (2022) and 14 (2021). – West Midlands Police recorded 22 antisemitic offences from October 7 to November 7, compared with one (2022) and eight (2021), while Merseyside Police recorded 20 compared with four (both 2022 and 2021). – The British Transport Police had one of the largest increases, recording 87 antisemitic offences in the month after October 7, up from eight in the same period in 2022 and 11 in 2021, as well as a jump in Islamophobic offences with 22 (2023), up from two (2022) and eight (2021). – West Yorkshire recorded 49 Islamophobic offences in this period in 2023, up from 29 (2022) and 38 (2021), but the pattern was not so clear for Greater Manchester (34 in 2023, 43 in 2022 and 42 in 2021) or West Midlands (25 in 2023, 33 in 2022 and 23 in 2021). The Community Security Trust described the figures as “shocking” and said they made clear “the extent of the unacceptable rise in anti-Jewish hatred across the country since the Hamas terror attack on October 7”. A spokesman for the Jewish charity said: “This wave of antisemitism was triggered by the mass murder, rape and kidnapping of Jews in Israel, and is fuelled and sustained by extremist hatred online and on our streets. “It is essential that perpetrators are identified and prosecuted, and that wider society shows its disgust for this racist hate crime.” Tell Mama, which monitors and works to tackle anti-Muslim sentiment and abuse in the UK, told PA that “levels of anti-Muslim hatred and discrimination are deeply worrying, impacting trust in authorities and their sense of identity and belonging”. Iman Atta, the organisation’s director, said there had been a “significant spike in anti-Muslim hate since the atrocities on October 7”, adding: “The nature of many offline cases sent to our service is often overtly racist – targeting Arab and Palestinian communities with dehumanising slurs, anti-Muslim slurs or in some cases targeting their homes, or when speaking Arabic in public, as well as targeting Muslim communities across all ages and gender. “We should never allow such hatred and intolerance to take root in our communities and at this time, please look out for each other, whether Muslim or Jewish. We must stand together against intolerance, hate and racism.” The Metropolitan Police, the largest force in the UK, said delays prevented it from supplying full figures until the new year, but it had previously reported 218 antisemitic and 101 Islamophobic offences between October 1 and 18 this year, compared with 15 and 42 respectively in the same period in 2022. PA obtained full responses from 31 of the 46 forces across the UK, with the data representing a snapshot of what has currently been recorded by forces and is therefore subject to change. Methods for recording hate crime are not consistent across forces, so the data cannot be used to compare the number of offences between different areas or provide an overall total for the whole of the UK. But the figures do point to a jump in antisemitic offences recorded by forces concentrated mostly in cities or across built-up areas, while the pattern for Islamophobic offences was more varied. Some forces that operate across a mix of urban and less populated areas tend to show a similar pattern, although with lower volumes of offences – for example Hertfordshire Police (17 antisemitic offences for the period in 2023, compared with six in 2022 and three in 2021) and Thames Valley Police (21 antisemitic offences in 2023, one in 2022 and four in 2021). Data obtained from smaller forces, or those covering areas with few towns or cities, typically showed low numbers of offences, often in single figures, meaning a clear trend was hard to determine. A spokesman for the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the findings “provide further evidence of the huge upsurge in antisemitism following the Hamas massacre of October 7”. The board, seen as the voice of the British Jewish community with over 300 deputies directly elected by the synagogues and communal organisations they represent, told PA the rise in antisemitism had “caused enormous anxiety for Jewish people, particularly children and Jewish students on campus or indeed anyone easily identified as Jewish by their dress”. A spokesman added: “We call on police to take strong action against anyone found to be perpetrating hate crimes.” The Muslim Council of Britain said: “Despite the extremely low reporting rate from Muslim communities, the huge increase in Islamophobic hate crimes recorded with the police reflects what we are seeing from third-party reporting groups. “The Government’s laissez-faire attitude to Islamophobia contrasts strongly with its no-tolerance approach to antisemitism. We are hopeful this will now change.” A spokesperson for the Home Office said: “There is no place for hate in our society and we condemn the recent rise in reported antisemitic and anti-Muslim hatred. “We expect the police to fully investigate all hate crimes and work with the CPS to make sure the cowards who commit these abhorrent offences feel the full force of the law. “Following recent events, we have also made further funding available to Jewish and Muslim communities, to provide additional security at places of worship and faith schools.”",

    "text": "27% dos trabalhadores estão em busca de novas oportunidades, muitas vezes motivado pela insatisfação com o retorno ao presencial A pandemia da Covid-19 trouxe mudanças significativas para o trabalho, levando muitas empresas a adotar modelos híbridos ou remotos. Profissionais buscam mais flexibilidade e benefícios para se manter engajados e produtivos. No início de 2020, quando a Covid-19 chegou ao Brasil, ninguém tinha ideia do impacto que a pandemia traria para todos. As mudanças de comportamento e estilo de vida aconteceram em todos os setores da sociedade. Agora, quase cinco anos depois, algumas mudanças parecem naturais, melhores e difíceis de voltar atrás. Um exemplo, e que impacta diretamente na vida de milhões de pessoas diariamente, é o trabalho presencial, que para muitos já não faz mais sentido. Dados do 8º relatório anual “State of Hybrid Work”, da Owl Labs, mostram que 27% dos trabalhadores nos Estados Unidos estão em regime híbrido e 11% atuam remotamente. Mais da metade, 50%, acreditam que seus empregadores exigem presença física apenas para “ocupar” o imóvel vazio da empresa. Além disso, o relatório revela um dado crucial: mais de 1 em cada 4 profissionais (27%) está em busca de novas oportunidades, muitas vezes motivado pela insatisfação com políticas de retorno ao presencial, já que 25% dos trabalhadores revelaram que a empresa em que trabalham mudou a política de trabalho remoto ou híbrido no ano passado. Para a fundadora da QUARE e especialista em desenvolvimento de pessoas, Carolina Valle Schrubbe, a resistência ao modelo 100% presencial é um dos maiores desafios enfrentados pelas empresas. “Durante a pandemia, experimentamos o trabalho remoto. Enquanto alguns não se adaptaram, muitos identificaram benefícios significativos nesse modelo”, destaca. Ela ressalta que as organizações que exigem retorno total ao escritório precisam avaliar se a presença física é realmente indispensável para sua produtividade. Caso seja, um dos caminhos para não perder talentos é oferecer benefícios relevantes, como compensações financeiras, boas condições de trabalho e oportunidades de desenvolvimento. Cultura empresarial e novos desejos dos trabalhadores O estresse no ambiente corporativo também é um tema crescente. De acordo com o relatório, os gerentes enfrentam uma carga emocional 55% maior que a de outros colaboradores. Ao mesmo tempo, a percepção sobre produtividade mudou: 62% dos gerentes avaliam que suas equipes são mais produtivas em modelos híbridos ou remotos. No relatório de 2023, esse número era um pouco maior, 79%. Convencer os profissionais a voltarem ao escritório exige mais do que benefícios superficiais. Em 2024, 91% dos trabalhadores afirmaram que podem ser atraídos para o modelo presencial, desde que as condições sejam atrativas. Entre as principais demandas estão aumento salarial (41%), trajetos mais curtos (28%) e ambientes mais privativos. Resistir à cultura da dedicação integral é outra atitude em mudança. Segundo o relatório, 1 em cada 5 trabalhadores (22%) está estabelecendo limites mais claros, evitando assumir tarefas fora de suas funções. Além disso, cerca de 20% não respondem às comunicações corporativas fora do horário de trabalho. Para Carolina, atender a essas expectativas exige uma abordagem estratégica. “A flexibilidade deixou de ser um diferencial e se tornou uma necessidade. Ignorar essa realidade pode aumentar a rotatividade e reduzir o engajamento das equipes”, alerta. O impacto financeiro para trabalhadores e empresas O custo do profissional para trabalhar no escritório também é uma preocupação crescente dos colaboradores. O estudo revelou que profissionais híbridos gastam, em média, US$61 por dia no trabalho presencial — um aumento de 20% em relação a 2023. Já o custo diário do home office subiu de US$15 para US$19 no mesmo período. Essa disparidade faz com que muitos trabalhadores esperem aumentos salariais para compensar os gastos adicionais ou, em alguns casos, estejam dispostos a abrir mão de parte de sua remuneração em troca de maior flexibilidade. A diretora da QUARE enfatiza que, além do impacto financeiro, é fundamental avaliar o custo do turnover. “A saída de um colaborador não engajado gera gastos com recrutamento, treinamento e integração, além de comprometer a produtividade durante o período de adaptação”, explica. Futuro do trabalho: flexibilidade como palavra-chave Com os avanços tecnológicos e mudanças culturais, o escritório tradicional já não é mais uma solução única. A adoção de modelos flexíveis tem se mostrado essencial para manter a satisfação e a produtividade. “A flexibilidade permite que os funcionários adaptem seu trabalho ao seu estilo de vida, o que pode aumentar a satisfação, a retenção e a produtividade. Afinal de contas, o que promoveria um maior impacto positivo para empresa? Ter a presença física do colaborador ou tê-lo dedicado e engajado em fazer o que tem que ser feito, seja onde estiver. Ser feliz trabalhando! Uma frase que há pouco tempo era privilégio de poucos, hoje é o elixir da alta performance”, conclui. Para empresas que desejam prosperar na nova realidade, a lição é clara: adaptar-se às demandas dos profissionais é o caminho para construir um ambiente de trabalho produtivo e sustentável.
