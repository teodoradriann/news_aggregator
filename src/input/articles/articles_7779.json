    "title": "Q2 Billings Area Weather: A wicked, wintry weekend",
    "text": "BILLINGS — Some mid-level moisture will continue to jet through the area today bringing a slight chance of light snow this morning with little to no accumulation expected. We may get a glimpse of sunshine this afternoon, though. It will be colder with highs mainly in the 30s. There will be a better chance for snow across the weekend as a bigger surge of moisture streams into the area especially Saturday night into Sunday. Several inches of snow is expected across the region. (see attached graphics) Up to a foot of snow will be possible in the mountains. Strong winds (gusts 30-40 mph) are also forecast to go along with heavy snow in eastern MT which could mean near blizzard conditions on Sunday in and around Baker. Daytime highs on Saturday will be a little warmer pushing into the upper 30s and even some low 40s before a colder blast of frigid air comes in to knock those daytime highs down into the 20s on Sunday. Nighttime lows will be in the single digits and teens Sunday and Monday nights. It will warm up the first part of next week with highs in the 30s and 40s ahead of another system coming in by the middle of the week that could bring more rain and snow. This is something we'll be keeping an eye on. -Miller Robson Q2 Morning Meteorologist [miller.robson@ktvq.com](mailto:miller.robson@ktvq.com)",

    "title": "2024 Paris Olympics: Ruthless Germany exploit Matildas shortcomings at both set pieces and open play | The West Australian",
    "text": "Set pieces are a small but important part of football. Like an ever-loosening bolt in a car, a small thing which can have devastating consequences if not tended to. Tony Gustavsson, a man once credited for the USA women’s team’s set piece dominance, must have been tearing his David Bowie in Zoolander-esque hair out as he watched Marina Hegering and Lea Schuller nod home uncontested headers from corners as Australian defenders looked on in horror. Germany were solid but unspectacular in their 3-0 win over the Matildas in the early hours of Friday morning, but the game and result in itself was a paradox; the Matildas lost this game both because of set pieces, and not because of set pieces. The two goals they conceded at set pieces proved too large a deficit for Australia to overcome, but in their opening Olympics bout, they failed to throw a punch, not least land a blow. Chalking it up simply to a lack of Sam Kerr would be fingernail-deep analysis; even their talismanic skipper would have struggled to make an impact. Germany’s compact defensive shape blunted the Matildas’ attack, as they sat deep and easily soaked up their attacking pressure, their defenders relative spectators. Mary Fowler, the player the Matildas simply had to get on the ball, was isolated throughout the game, depending on scraps and unable to dictate proceedings centrally as the team looked to the wings for comfort. Cortnee Vine and Hayley Raso were ghosts, willing drifters but unable to leave any physical impact on proceedings, try as they might and even after Vine swapped to allow Caitlin Foord to play centrally, it was Foord drifting left to link up with Steph Catley which was their main attacking nexus. Ellie Carpenter and Catley grew into the game and provided the side’s best forays forward from full-back, which says something about the impact of those playing higher up the park. In games before the Olympics, Carpenter and Catley had inverted and shifted centrally to overload the middle of the pitch and drag defenders into places they did not want to go, but for the most part against Germany they hugged the touchline. There was more than one occasion where Raso and Carpenter were needlessly sharing the same space out wide, although when Carpenter did drift inside on the hour mark, it did open up space and lead to a chance. Either side of the set piece goals, Germany looked the more likely team to find the net, and Jule Brand gave the Matildas a taste of their own counter-attacking medicine, their third goal a free-flowing and wonderful riptose to the U-shaped possession Australia had made their own. The Germans played the game on their terms, doing what they needed to get the result while harnessing a healthy degree of control over proceedings. Mackenzie Arnold had little to do other than pick the ball out of her own net, although Alanna Kennedy and Clare Hunt were under duress at times, the latter looking uncharacteristically-unstable, perhaps a by-product of a late-season stress fracture in her foot. And now, the Matildas find themselves in a familiar backs-to-the-wall situation, their 3-0 defeat deflating their odds of progressing from the group stage. The heavy loss will put their hopes of going through as one of the best third-placed teams in jeopardy, with goal difference certain to play a pivotal role in progression. They are now pushing the sled uphill, and a big win over Zambia — a team who possess excellent threats in transition — is required to keep their dreams alive, before they face a USA outfit high on confidence. Gustavsson, whose contract expires at the end of the Olympics, will likely put a lot of emphasis on set piece defence ahead of their last two group games. But with last call at the last chance saloon approaching quicker than any Paris party-goers would like, he would do well to quickly find some fluidity and incisiveness in attack.",

    "title": "Alert! Fake AI Video Tools Are Being Used To Spread Malware: Here’s How To Stay Safe",
    "text": "With the rising popularity of AI-powered tools, hackers have picked up on the chance to target unsuspecting users. Reports in recent days have mentioned yet another rising issue, where malicious actors have been leveraging fake AI video tools to spread malware to Windows and macOS devices. These fake tools look genuine, with the promise of easy-to-use, free video generation services attracting users. Unfortunately, these fake websites are indeed traps that steal personal information, such as cryptocurrency wallets, passwords, and other browsing data. Here's what you need to know to keep yourself safe. Fake AI Tools Lure Users In Hackers have been spreading malware through fake websites masquerading as the AI video generator tool EditPro. Posts on social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter) advertise these free AI tools, promising not to require any special skills to use. Clicking on these posts directs users to a website that looks genuine but is actually set to infect their computers. Using familiar cookie banners and legitimate-looking interfaces, these malicious websites are highly believable, making spotting them tough. How the Malware Works Once users click on the “Get now” button, they unknowingly begin downloading harmful files – one for Windows (\\\"Edit-ProAI-Setup-newest_release.exe\\\") and another for macOS (\\\"EditProAi_v.4.36.dmg\\\"). These files contain dangerous malware, including Lumma Stealer for Windows and AMOS for macOS. These malware types are designed to steal login credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and browsing history; the stolen data is forwarded to the hackers, who may use it for subsequent attacks or sell it off on the dark web. What You Should Do If you have unknowingly downloaded these files, it is advisable to change passwords of all affected accounts right away. Hackers usually advertise online software as free and easy-to-use; exercise extra caution when downloading anything online as these products could be infected with malware. Always verify the authenticity of any tool before trusting it with your private data. Be alert and think twice before you click that ‘download’ button!

    "title": "Spain: Adverse weather forecast across northeastern regions Aug. 3 | Crisis24",
    "text": "Severe weather is forecast across parts of northeastern Spain Aug. 3. Transport, business, and utility disruptions possible. Heavy rainfall and thunderstorms are forecast across parts of northeastern Spain Aug. 3. Strong winds, lightning, and hail may accompany storms. Heavy downpours may trigger flooding in low-lying areas and strong winds could cause property damage and power outages. The State Meteorological Agency (Agencia Estatal de Meteorologia, AEMET) has issued orange thunderstorm warnings across parts of southern Aragon, northern Catalonia, and northern Valencia autonomous communities and yellow thunderstorm warnings across the rest of the affected area. Yellow heavy rainfall warnings are in place across parts of northern and southern Aragon, far northeastern Castile-La Mancha, central and northern Catalonia, and northern Valencia autonomous communities. Authorities will likely issue new alerts or update/rescind existing advisories as weather conditions change over the coming hours. Sustained heavy rainfall could trigger flooding in low-lying communities near rivers, streams, and creeks. Urban flooding is also possible in developed areas with easily overwhelmed stormwater drainage systems. Sites downstream from large reservoirs or rivers may be subject to flash flooding after relatively short periods of intense rainfall. Landslides are possible in hilly or mountainous areas, especially where heavy rainfall has saturated the soil. Authorities could issue mandatory evacuation orders for flood-prone communities over the coming days. Where significant flooding, landslides, or strong winds impact utility networks, disruptions to electricity and telecommunications services are possible. Floodwaters and debris flows may render some bridges, rail networks, or roadways impassable, impacting overland travel in and around affected areas. Ponding on road surfaces could cause hazardous driving conditions on regional highways. Authorities could temporarily close some low-lying routes that become inundated by floodwaters. The disruptive weather may cause some delays and cancellations at airports in the affected regions. Flooding could block regional rail lines; freight cancellations are possible in areas with heavy rainfall and potential track blockages. Localized business disruptions are possible in areas impacted by severe weather; some businesses might not operate at full capacity because of damage to facilities, possible evacuations, and some employees' inability to reach work sites. Monitor local media for weather-related updates and advisories. Confirm all transport reservations and business arrangements before traveling in the affected area. Seek updated information on road conditions before driving or routing shipments through areas where severe weather is forecast; plan for possible supply chain disruptions throughout the affected areas. Stay away from elevated streams, creeks, and other watercourses that are prone to flash flooding. Do not attempt to navigate flooded roadways. Exercise caution in elevated terrain due to the threat of landslides. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",

    "title": "How a Former Sex Worker Re-Entered the Workplace - Air Mail",
    "text": "When I was a teenager, a biker with missing teeth taught me how to handle myself during what for many years I thought was a job interview: stare into the client’s eyes; touch him on his collarbone or forearm; repeat his name; make sure he gets a good look at my ass. So today, my C.V. notes, “Full employment history available upon request.” My first job was as a professional dominatrix. I received my first “paycheck” at 17 years old. I was a kid, and I was a sex worker, a combination that was exciting at the time, but later proved dicey. A decade later, when I became interested in working outside the adult industry, there wasn’t a working self to return to. This got weird, which my C.V. can attest to. Culture and media understand sex work as either a stopgap measure until you get a “real job,” or something that is inflicted on women who are not savvy enough to understand their own status as victims. My experience was more complicated. It was only once I decided that I wanted to leave the adult industry that shame crept in. I had been out as a sex worker for years and largely was not ashamed of my work, but suddenly I was embarrassed to tell people what I did for a living. I was jealous of administrative assistants and paralegals and grant writers. How do you get those jobs?, I wondered. I never found out. I became a welder, working as an ironworker on high-rise buildings. I went into metalwork for many reasons, but one of the main ones was I knew my co-workers would be other corporate-incompatible types. They had D.U.I.’s and other legal troubles. Few had attended college, and some hadn’t finished high school. Many had some variety of messiness from a past life, but still, I kept my own past life private. I wanted to be myself and not have to hide, but I didn’t know how to fit those competing desires into a space where I could also make money and earn respect. Eventually, I realized I wanted to get out of working with my body and into a life of the mind. I had spent a year in college during my early sex-work days, and I returned in my 30s to finish my degree in English, but I didn’t have a career plan. The only academic or professional thing I knew how to do was write. A few years later, when I applied to M.F.A. programs in creative writing, I faced the task of crafting personal statements. Because I intended to address my work experiences, it felt disingenuous not to mention how I had made a living. But it also seemed stupid and inappropriate to talk about sex work in what was essentially a job application. I stared at the blank computer screen for weeks, starting sentences I would then furiously delete. Sex work primes you for an odd sort of power. You serve as a vessel for desire, you turn desire into cash, and you also circumvent, however temporarily, some of the crushing burden of economic survival under capitalism. With sex work you can steal back your own time, define your own life. For most of my years as a dominatrix, I was self-employed, and I showed up when I wanted, how I wanted. I got to choose my schedule, set my own dress code, and decide how I would behave on the job. For as long as you’re in it and it’s going well—meaning you’re making money and staying out of danger—that power feels like invincibility. But the feeling fades, and fast, once you leave. Trying to re-enter “civilian” society, I finally felt the full weight of the stigma I’d accrued. I sought advice about my grad-school applications from people who told me, in essence, Don’t say that shit, you’re not going to get in. I didn’t listen. I knew I couldn’t spend another era of my life hiding, pretending not to have a sketchy work history and acting like I didn’t know anything about the seedier corners of the world I once enthusiastically occupied. I needed to paint myself into a corner where being my true self was the only option. When I finally wrote my personal statements, they opened with these lines: “I am applying to graduate school in my mid-30s, with half a life of unique experience behind me and the rest to spend exploring the meaning of everything I’ve seen. I write about men, women, power, and sex, and in doing so I hope I am writing about how we live. I spent 10 years as a professional dominatrix in New York City and 10 more working as an ironworker on a high-rise welding crew.” Five minutes after I clicked Submit on the first application, I felt like I was going to throw up. But I got in. When I went on a campus visit to the University of Arizona, the professor who would later become my thesis advisor heard me walking down the hallway in my loud motorcycle boots. She called out, “Is that the dominatrix?” We laughed together as I entered her office, and I knew I had found a place where I didn’t have to hide. After I graduated with my M.F.A., I sold my book. I walk through life now knowing that I am one Google search away from anyone discovering what I used to do for a living, as well as everything else I once labored to keep hidden. For the price of $17.95 plus shipping, any of my current or prospective clients, students, or employers can read my book, Brutalities: A Love Story, and learn the details of how I spent my younger life. This information is out there, because I put it there. I don’t want to hide any longer. Some days, this is a relief. Because I can’t, I don’t have to try. Other days, it’s a horror: what do my undergraduate students or other parents at my kid’s school drop-off think about me? Within myself, I feel far removed from the young, bold, and urgently curious person who first walked into the dungeon. By now, I could be her mother. I met a new friend recently—another mom with a young child. While we were sitting over lattes and sharing information about ourselves, I did some of the quick mental math that has become second nature to me. What are the chances she’ll see my book on social? Read a caption or click a link that makes her decide she doesn’t want to be friends with me or want me around her kids? What are the chances she will understand that the adult industry carries a complex matrix of harms and freedoms, just like any other field? Much of what people think about me is, of course, in the end, unknowable. Just a battle I wage with myself in my head. I aspire to care about it less and less. But still, when I told my new friend what I used to do for work and she didn’t even raise an eyebrow, I felt my body relax. Margo Steines is the author of Brutalities: A Love Story",
