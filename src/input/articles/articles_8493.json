    "text": "El\nexgobernador de Tamaulipas, Tomás Yarrington Ruvalcaba, fue entregado por autoridades de Estados Unidos a México, donde enfrenta varias denuncias.\nVistiendo pantalón, sudadera gris y lentes de aumento, la entrega del político matamorese se llevó a cabo por la frontera entre San Diego y Tijuana, a elementos de la Fiscalía General de la República (FGR).\nPoco después de mediodía se realizó el protocolo para entregar al exmandatario tamaulipeco que cumplió de manera anticipada en Estados Unidos, una condena de nueve años de prisión por el delito de conspiración para cometer lavado de dinero.\nTomás Yarrington y sus nexos con el narcotráfico\nTomás Yarrington era investigado en Estados Unidos por facilitar el tráfico de drogas hacia ese país, aceptando sobornos del Cártel del Golfo, que según la DEA y el Departamento de Justicia, habrían sumado más de 9 millones de dólares.\nLa entonces Procuraduría General de la República (PGR) ofrecía una recompensa de 15 millones de pesos y en abril del 2017 en la plaza Beccaria de Florencia, Italia, fue detenido y trasladado en 2018 a Estados Unidos.\nEn marzo del 2021, el político tamaulipeco aceptó un acuerdo de culpabilidad con el que se declaró culpable del delito de lavado de dinero, luego de haber recibido sobornos mientras se desempeñó como gobernador de Tamaulipas entre 1999 y 2004.\nAunque Yarrington solo aceptó haber recibido 3.5 millones que blanqueó con la compra de propiedades en ese país, logró evadir los cargos relacionados con conspiración para traficar drogas y entregó un departamento que poseía en Puerto Isabel.\n¿Quién es Tomás Yarrington, exgobernador de Tamaulipas?\nTomás Jesús Yarrington Ruvalcaba estudió Economía en el Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (Tec de Monterrey) y en 1991 comenzó su carrera política como diputado del PRI.\nEn 1993 alcanzó la presidencia municipal de Matamoros, cargo en el que estuvo hasta 1995. Con más presencia dentro del PRI, logró hacerse dirigente en su entidad, además de que fue secretario de Hacienda del\ngobierno de Manuel Cavazos, también en Tamaulipas.\nEn 1999 se convirtió en gobernador de Tamaulipas, cargo en el que mantuvo hasta 2004, cuando salieron a la luz sus vínculos con el narcotráfico.\nYarrington aspiraba a la candidatura presidencial del PRI para 2006; sin embargo, perdió ante Roberto Madrazo, quien quedó tercero en la elección contra\nFelipe Calderón y Andrés Manuel López Obrador.",

    "text": "RICHLAND, Wash.-Kadlec healthcare workers have voted to ratify a new three-year contract with Providence Swedish.\nAccording to SEIU Healthcare 1199, the union for nurses and healthcare employees, workers at Kadlec in Richland and the freestanding emergency room in Kennewick, reached an agreement on Oct. 19 and ratified the contract by vote on Oct. 23-24.\n“Winning this contract took more than just bargaining — it took months of organizing, taking action inside and outside the hospital, and, ultimately, a strike to get what we deserve,” said Billy Haley, an electrophysiology technician at Kadlec and member of the union bargaining team.\nUnder the new contract new wage scales for tech and service job classes will be implemented on Dec. 1, 2024, with tech workers seeing a minimum of 8.25 percent wage increases over the next three years and service workers getting a minimum of $3.25/hour increases, according to SEIU.\nThe contract also ensures workers’ voices are heard regarding decisions that affect medical benefits, meal and rest periods; a hospital-wide staffing committee; and no cuts to their current contract, according to an SEIU press release.\n\"We fought for wages that keep pace with the cost of living in the Tri-Cities, and staffing levels that will make sure we can care for our patients safely,” said Ramona Chalmers, a certified nursing assistant and member of the union bargaining team.",

Photo: Jonathon Candy;Ethan Candy;Dylan Candy/Facebook\nAn Oklahoma mother and three of her sons were found dead earlier this week after being fatally shot by her husband, who then turned the gun on himself, authorities said.\nAccording to Oklahoma City police, Jonathon Candy, 42, carried out the killings of his wife, Lindsay Candy, 39, and three of their four children — Dylan Candy, 18, Ethan Candy, 14, and Lucas Candy, 12, after an argument inside their family home on April 22.\nAuthorities later revealed that the couple’s 10-year-old son was the sole survivor and was the one who called 911.\nPolice Believe Okla. Dad Fatally Shot Wife, 3 of Their Children Before Turning Gun on Himself Police said they never received calls to the family’s home prior to the murders and that they had no history of domestic abuse reports.\nWhile authorities continue to investigate a motive for the violence, here is everything we know about the case so far.\n10-Year-Old Son Finds Bodies, Calls 911 At an April 23 press conference, police shared that the couple’s 10-year-old son woke up that morning to find five bodies and subsequently dialed 911 around 9:35 a.m.\n10-Year-Old Sole Survivor of Family Murder-Suicide Called 911 After Discovering Bodies: Police The boy said that “everyone inside the home appeared to be dead,” according to police.\nAccording to ABC News , Oklahoma City Police Sgt.

Dad Kill Wife and 3 Sons in Murder-Suicide? Family 'Can't Fathom' What Went Wrong “Our entire family has been left shattered and confused with so many questions we won’t ever have answers to,” the statement reads, according to the outlet. “Jonathon was the one whose jokes and goofy attitude kept everyone smiling. Aside from these events, his children and wife were his entire life.”\nFrom left: Lucas Candy, Dylan Candy and Ethan Candy in a photo from 2012. Jonathon Candy/Facebook\nThe statement continues, “I simply can’t fathom what went on but please, hug your family tight. It’s going to be a very long healing process for everyone affected.”\nPolice Believe Dad ‘Hunted’ Down Family Before Murders While police have yet to share a motive for the violence, an investigator theorized what happened in the home prior to the murders.\n3 Sons Killed in Okla.

What happened in that residence was nothing short of a massacre,\" Oklahoma City Police Sgt.

Jonathon Candy Facebook\n“I come here twice a week in the morning just for their breakfast burritos, which are by far anything better than you can get around here,” Jonathan says in the video with Lindsay nodding in agreement. “I love it ‘cause I can eat a big burrito, and then I don’t have to eat until night time.”\nOkla. Couple Appeared in Interview Nearly 2 Years Before Husband Murdered Wife, 3 Sons, Then Turned Gun on Self “I love carrot cake. I don’t eat a lot of sweets, even with my last name.” Jonathan jokes while Lindsay laughs. “But I love the carrot cake.”\nLindsay adds, “I like the cannoli. The cannoli are good.”\nFriends of Family Speak Out Following Tragedy Those who knew the family spoke out at a vigil held by Ethan's baseball team on April 23.\nT.J. Armstrong, head coach of the Mustang Misfits, described the Candy family as \"your all-American family... I could live 100,000 lifetimes and never expect this out of that,\" he said, according to KOKH-TV.\nWyatt Livecy, identified as Ethan's best friend, told the outlet, \"I could have never imagined that. Ever. In my whole entire life... I'm still in shock.\"\nRhonda Armstrong, who described her self as the \"team mom\" added, \"At this point, I just wish the nightmare would be over. I wish it was all a bad dream and that we would wake up and they would still be here,\" the outlet reports.\nAnyone with information on the case is asked to call the Oklahoma City Police Department's Homicide Tip Line at 405-297-1200.\nIf you are experiencing domestic violence, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233, or go to thehotline.org .

    "text": "SOUTH HADLEY, Mass. — The SUNY Cobleskill women’s basketball team opened the 2024 portion of the schedule impressively on Thursday evening mauling the host Lyons of Mount Holyoke College (MHC) 81-38 in non-conference action. With the victory, the Fighting Tigers improved to 11-1 overall on the season to date while the Lyons fell to 1-11 on the year. The Fighting Tigers came out aggressively showing little rust after their winter break racing out to a 43-16 halftime advantage from which they never looked back using defensive pressure to turn over the Lyons 10 times during the stanza which led to 15 points while grabbing 16 offensive rebounds leading to 17 second chance points in the half. Senior center Logan Thayne, of Hoosick Falls, led the Cobleskill attack posting her sixth double/double of the season with game-highs of 20 points and 12 rebounds along with three blocked shots and a pair of assists while junior forward Cara Walker, added 18 points, seven rebounds and two assists on the night. The Orange & Black also received strong outings from junior guard/forward Antonia May, of Amsterdam, with 12 points, six rebounds, three assists, and two blocked shots, and from junior point guard Taylor Meacham, of Berne, who added 12 points, nine rebounds, four assists and three steals. First-year guard Alyssa Martin, of Castleton, was also a factor off the bench for the Fighting Tigers with five points, two rebounds, and an assist. Cobleskill will return to North Atlantic Conference (NAC) play on Tuesday, Jan. 9 when they host the Wildcats of the SUNY Polytechnic Institute for a conference contest at the Iorio Gymnasium beginning at 7:30 p.m.",
