    "title": "Newly identified chemical in drinking water is likely present in many homes and could be toxic, study finds",
    "text": "About a third of U.S. residents have been receiving tap water containing a previously unidentified chemical byproduct, a new study has found. Some scientists are now concerned — and actively investigating — whether that chemical could be toxic. The newly identified substance, named “chloronitramide anion,” is produced when water is treated with chloramine, a chemical formed by mixing chlorine and ammonia. Chloramine is often used to kill viruses and bacteria in municipal water treatment systems. Researchers said the existence of the byproduct was discovered about 40 years ago, but it was only identified now because analysis techniques have improved, which finally enabled scientists to determine the chemical’s structure. It could take years to figure out whether chloronitramide anion is dangerous — it’s never been studied. The researchers reported their findings Thursday in the journal Science , in part to spur research to address safety concerns.

They think it deserves scrutiny because it’s been detected so widely. “It has similarity to other toxic molecules,” said David Wahman, one of the study’s authors and a research environmental engineer at the Environmental Protection Agency. “We looked for it in 40 samples in 10 U.S. chlorinated drinking water systems located in seven states. We did find it in all the samples.” Chloronitramide anion is produced as chloramine decays over time. It’s likely to be found in all drinking water treated via this method, he said. U.S. & World News from around the country and around the globe The fact that a byproduct with unknown risks could be so ubiquitous and evade researchers for so long renews questions about potential health effects of the chemicals used to treat tap water. Some 113 million U.S. residents receive chloramine-treated water from their taps, according to the study. The chemical has been used for about a century to disinfect water. Today, it’s often used to protect a system’s “residual” — the water that remains in pipes for several days after it leaves a water treatment plant. Increasingly, chloramine has been favored over chlorine because the latter also produces byproducts, some of which are associated with bladder cancer and are regulated by the EPA. David Reckhow, a research professor in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who was not involved with the study, said the finding was an important step. The ultimate goal, he said, is understanding whether the substance is a hazard; he concurred that it was likely toxic. “It’s a pretty small molecule and it can probably for that reason enter into biological systems and into cells. And it is still a reactive molecule,” he said. “Those are the kinds of things you worry about.” The authors of the new study arrived at their results after figuring out how to formulate high concentrations of the chemical for laboratory testing, said Julian Fairey, lead author and an associate professor at the University of Arkansas. “We don’t know the toxicity but this study has enabled us to be able to do that work now,” said Fairey, who studies drinking water byproducts. “Now, we can go about the hard work of trying to figure out what its toxicological relevance is in our water systems.” He added that some past studies have suggested a link between drin king disinfected water and increased rates of certain cancers . “We don’t know what’s driving these. We have no idea if this compound is in any way related to those outcomes,” Fairey said. “But we have unexplained incidents of certain types of cancer from treated drinking water.” However, any conclusions about whether the newly identified substance is toxic are likely many years away. Potential regulation based on those eventual findings would take even longer. “It’s a lot — probably a decade of research once a funding source is found,” said Alan Roberson, executive director of the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators. Reckhow said that in the meantime, water utilities should pay close attention to ongoing research and try to reduce people’s exposure. “You do what you can to minimize,” he said. “You make the best judgment you can on the toxicity and you run with incomplete information. That’s the world we live in, unfortunately.” The EPA only regulates a handful of disinfectant byproducts, including several associated with the use of chlorine. Scientists said those regulations have pushed some water providers to increase the use of chloramine. “This study really calls into question whether or not this disinfection process is safer from a health perspective,” said David Andrews, a senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization that pushes for more scrutiny of chemicals. He added that there are hundreds of disinfection byproducts found in water systems but that this one deserves scrutiny. “Many of those other contaminants are occurring at lower concentrations or less frequently,” Andrews said. Any treatment of drinking water involves some level of health risk, Roberson said. It’s a trade-off: Disinfection processes have largely vanquished waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid, but research suggests that some byproducts are associated with risks of cancer and miscarriage. “The reason you’re adding the chloramine — you want to kill the bacteria and viruses, you have a real risk-risk trade-off,” he said. Many U.S. water utilities disclose on their websites whether they treat the water they supply with chlorine or chloramine. Wahman said some research suggests that active carbon filters, such as those used in home water purification devices or refrigerator filters, can remove disinfectant byproducts but that more research is needed.

    "title": "State-ranked Albany set for Week 2 battle with East Atchison",
    "text": "(Albany) -- State-ranked Albany football made their ranking stand up this past Friday, rolling to a 66-6 win over Stewartsville/Osborn.\nThe co-No. 4 ranked Warriors played their brand of football in the win while rushing for 169 yards and five touchdowns on just 14 carries. They also threw for 63 yards and three more scores.\n“Week 1 can always be kind of a mystery,” Albany head coach Doug Fountain told KMA Sports. “A little bit of uncertainty of what you’re going to get. We’ve got a pretty veteran crew with a lot of returning experience. That’s not to say some roles haven’t changed a bit, but these kids have played a lot of varsity snaps.”\nNobody carried the ball more than the five times Elliot Mercer did, as he finished with 80 yards and three touchdowns. Kole Emerson and Trevor Akins also scored rushing touchdowns, and quarterback Chase Cline threw for 50 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Emerson, Zane Rippy and Jared Owens all had one receiving touchdown.\n“We had some advantages in some areas,” Fountain said. “We’ve certainly been on the other side of that coin before. We played at a level we thought was a good level, we executed and we were pleased.”\nThe defense was also strikingly balanced with Mercer’s 6.0 tackles leading the way. Mercer also had 5.0 tackles for loss and 2.0 sacks among those six takedowns. In all, 15 players were credited with at least one tackle.\n“We’ve got some guys with certain skills,” Fountain said. “We really want to develop where we can hurt you with multiple people in multiple ways. The kids did a good job. Defensively at the jamboree (a week earlier), there were some things we were missing and not playing the way we want to play. I thought we shored those things up on Friday night.”\nNow, Albany turns their attention to a matchup at home with East Atchison (1-0). The Wolves were also dominant in the opening week, pulling away from King City for a 58-24 win. Quarterback Blake Simmons was honored as the KMA Sports Agrivision Equipment Group Player of the Night after throwing for 176 yards, rushing for 71 and accounting for six touchdowns.\n“They look to me to be a tremendous football team,” Fountain said. “They beat a very good King City team on Friday night, and they’ve got a lot of strengths. They’re very athletic in the skill spots. Very dynamic up front, and their kids get after it. Real physical in the box with the run game.”\nSenior Cameron Kephart will likely have Fountain and Albany’s attention after seven receptions for 141 yards and two touchdowns. Meanwhile, Brody Wennihan had a big night on defense with 15.0 tackles and 2.0 TFLs. Cameron Brooks and River Dow also had double-digit tackles with 11.0 and 10.0, respectively.\n“They’ve got multiple guys that can hurt you with the ball in their hands,” Fountain added. “Multiple offensively and defensively as East Atchison teams always are. They’re just stellar and physical at the line of scrimmage. They work off blocks extremely well, are always in leverage and well-coached. We’ll have a battle on our hands, and we’re looking forward to it.”\nLast season, Albany won a defensive battle with the Wolves, 22-18.\n“They’re going to play great defense,” Fountain said. “Our challenge is going to be keeping the explosive plays at a minimum because they’ve got the ability to hit you with home runs at any point on the field. We’ve got to keep the speed corralled and play with great discipline. Offensively, they don’t give up big chunks so we’re going to have to be disciplined to maintain and sustain drives and finish them in the red zone.”\nCasey Martin will have reports from Albany on Friday evening during the Midline Farms Football Connection Show. Listen to all of KMA Sports’ Week 2 coverage on AM 960, FM 99.1 and streaming at\nkmaland.com throughout the evening on Friday from 6:20 to midnight.\nHear the full interview with Coach Fountain in the audio file below.",

    "title": "Timmins news: Alliance calls on province to increase access to treatment for opioid addiction | CTV News",
    "text": "A new alliance of health-care workers, researchers and those with lived experience will launch at Queen’s Park on Friday.\nThe group is recommending the province make policy changes to break down barriers people face when accessing treatment for opioid addiction.\nThe number of opioid toxicity deaths in the four major northern cities ranges from 38 in Sudbury to 24 in Sault Ste. Marie, 13 in North Bay and 11 in Timmins. (Lydia Chubak/CTV News)\nSeamus Murphy of Timmins is part of One Step Forward, a group working to help people get barrier-free access to treatment for opioid addiction. He's also deputy chief for Cochrane District Paramedic Service in Timmins.\nMurphy’s desire to help is twofold. He’s a paramedic and two years ago, he lost a niece to an opioid overdose.\n\"You know, I thought people chose to use drugs. And the data shows that over 70 per cent were prescribed at first with opiates,\" said Murphy, a member of the Cochrane District Paramedic Service.\n\"That is because opiates are prescribed for pain and it can be any kind of pain. And that's what happened with my niece. So, you know, we have to try to work together across the district and across the agencies so that we can get, you know, at least a few positive outcomes doing this.\"\nThe alliance is rallying at Queen’s Park, asking the province for policy changes to help combat Ontario’s opioid crisis.\nOne Step Forward, a new alliance, is bringing its four main recommendations to increase access for opioid addiction treatment to Queen’s Park on Friday. (Lydia Chubak/CTV News Northern Ontario)\nThe alliance has four main recommendations for the province: establish a cross-ministry emergency task force; launch and fund a virtual opioid addiction treatment service; ensure a patient-centred approach; and, empower pharmacists to play a greater role.\nResearchers with the alliance said they discovered that in the past four years, despite an increase in opioid addiction, there’s been no increase in the number of Ontarians being treated for opioid use disorder.\n\"We did find, in fact, that there were a lot of barriers to access to treatment,\" said Jason Grier of Delphic Research.\n\"The most sort of common treatment pathway, you know, it really didn't represent a good option (for) all people.\"\nIndividual recovery needs Grier said people dealing with addiction have their own set of circumstances, but the system isn’t responding to their needs.\n\"The recovery journey needs to be as individual as they are,\" he said.\n\"And so that fundamentally, that was the barrier.\"\nThe province’s chief coroner’s office recently released opioid toxicity rates and all major northern Ontario cities rank in the Top 10 for the highest mortality rates in the first half of 2024.\nThe number of opioid toxicity deaths in the four major northern cities ranges from 38 in Sudbury to 24 in Sault Ste. Marie, 13 in North Bay and 11 in Timmins.\nMurphy said since 2017, 196 people in the Cochrane district have died from an opioid overdose. Only four were homeless and he said 95 per cent of the deaths happened in Timmins.\nGrier said it doesn't need to be that way.\n\"With the right treatment and the right support in a stigma-free setting, people can recover,\" he said.\n\"I've met people who have gone on that journey. And I think that is very heartening. I think that is something I hope all of us would take to heart, that we can do better and we can help people on this journey to recovery and they can go on to lead better lives.\"\nDownload the CTV News app now Get local breaking news alerts Daily newsletter with the top local stories emailed to your inbox",

    "text": "On to the next: O's quickly turn page as challenging stretch looms BALTIMORE -- The winning streak ended at a season-high six games. A second consecutive series sweep couldn’t be completed. But the Orioles don’t have any time to sulk. Baltimore fell, [6-3](https://www.mlb.com/gameday/braves-vs-orioles/2024/06/13/747026/final/box), in the finale vs. Atlanta at Camden Yards on Thursday afternoon, ending a hot streak that featured a four-game road sweep of the Rays and back-to-back wins over the Braves. It was only the Orioles' fifth loss in their past 21 games. Now, Baltimore’s challenging [June schedule](https://www.mlb.com/orioles/schedule/2024-06) -- which features 29 games in 30 days -- will reach its apex: A three-game home series vs. the National League-best Phillies (46-21) starting Friday, followed by the lone off-day of the month on Monday and then a three-game set vs. the MLB-best Yankees (49-22) at Yankee Stadium beginning Tuesday. “We have high belief in ourselves in this clubhouse. We feel like we can compete with anyone,” said outfielder [Kyle Stowers](https://www.mlb.com/player/669065), who hit a three-run homer in the seventh inning to account for all of Baltimore’s offense on Thursday. “We all play hard, pull for each other, and you combine those things with all the talent in here, we feel like we stack up with the rest of the league well.” That’s been the case for nearly two years now. The defending American League East champions have once again been one of the best teams in MLB this year, and 68 games into this season, the O's (45-23) are tied for the fourth-best start in franchise history. It’s difficult to sweep a Major League team, especially one as talented as the Braves (36-30). Although they snapped a five-game losing streak with their finale win, they still have the bulk of a core that led the club to an MLB-high 104 wins last year. So Baltimore is feeling good about taking two of three from Atlanta, and the club is ready to take on another challenging NL East foe in Philadelphia this weekend. “We’re focused on one pitch at a time, we’re focused on night in, night out. It doesn’t matter the opponent,” left-hander [Cole Irvin](https://www.mlb.com/player/608344) said. “It’s Major League Baseball. It’s the best. Everyone’s bringing their best every night. We’re keeping our head down, focused on the job at hand, trying to get the next strike, the next out, the next homer, the next whatever it may be.” One of the biggest reasons for the Orioles’ recent success has been their starting pitching. Irvin didn’t have his best stuff on Thursday, but he still nearly turned in a quality start, with four runs (three earned) over 5 2/3 innings. No Baltimore starter has yielded more than three earned runs since June 6, when lefty Cade Povich allowed six in 5 1/3 innings in his MLB debut at Toronto. Irvin racked up eight strikeouts, his most since recording 11 for the A’s on Aug. 24, 2022, vs. the Marlins. However, the 30-year-old also gave up nine hits, his most since yielding nine in a Sept. 29, 2022, start for Oakland against the Angels. Three of Atlanta’s hits came on the first three batters of the game, as Michael Harris II singled, Ozzie Albies doubled and then Marcell Ozuna drove them both in with a double to put Baltimore in a 2-0 hole four pitches into the contest. “I thought he threw the ball well. They know he throws strikes, and they came out and got a couple soft [hits] there early,” manager Brandon Hyde said of Irvin. “I thought he did a nice job, went into the sixth inning, threw a bunch of strikes and gave us a chance.” Stowers nearly ignited a comeback with his first home run of the season. It was the fourth of the 26-year-old’s MLB career, and his first since Sept. 29, 2022, at Boston. The Orioles had another opportunity to score late, putting runners on first and second with one out in the ninth. But they couldn’t erase their three-run deficit against Braves closer Raisel Iglesias. “It gave us a chance. We even had a chance at the end,” Stowers said. “This team doesn’t give up. We don’t quit.” Because of that, Baltimore has the ability to bounce back this weekend and potentially go on another strong run. “When the team’s winning, it’s a lot of fun,” Stowers said. “When we’re winning those ballgames, you just want to win, and there’s energy in the clubhouse when we win.”",

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "A principios de 2021, Kirsty Bortoft, una mujer británica de 49 años, vivió un episodio que desafía las explicaciones [médicas](https://www.bluradio.com/regiones/antioquia/investigan-si-muerte-de-asistente-de-bus-en-medellin-fue-un-accidente-o-un-acto-de-intolerancia-rg10) En el momento en que su prometido la encontró inconsciente en el sofá, Kirsty ya estaba \"sin vida\", según sus propias palabras. Extrañas figuras adornaban su piel, y la urgencia de la situación llevó a su prometido a llevarla de inmediato al hospital más cercano. Allí, los médicos confirmaron su fallecimiento, pero la historia no terminaría ahí. Cuarenta minutos después, los médicos lograron reanimar a Kirsty, quien emergió de la oscuridad con una narración impactante de su experiencia durante el tiempo que estuvo \"muerta\". En una conversación con The Sun, la mujer compartió que tuvo una \"descarga de información\" y que su espíritu se conectó con un amigo psíquico. El amigo psíquico, sin previo aviso, contactó a la hermana de Kirsty, revelando mensajes que desafiaban cualquier explicación lógica. Kirsty afirmó haberle dicho a su amigo psíquico que no podría sobrevivir, pero este insistió en que \"era fuerte\" y debía regresar. \"Mi misión aquí todavía no ha terminado\", expresó describiendo la sensación de regresar a su cuerpo como una \"descarga de información\". Publicidad Stu, su prometido, quien fue testigo de la dramática escena, confirmó la aparente falta de vida en Kirsty, destacando las figuras que cubrían su piel. En el hospital, los médicos le dieron a la mujer apenas un 6 % de posibilidades de sobrevivir. A pesar de esos sombríos pronósticos, lograron reanimarla tras intensos esfuerzos y un coma inducido. La experiencia de Kirsty la llevó a una rápida recuperación, impulsada por la meditación. Ahora, comparte su historia con el objetivo de ayudar a otros a enfrentar la oscuridad, destacando que, según su creencia, estamos aquí para \"despertar, crecer y alinear nuestras vibraciones\".
