    "title": "Europe's best 'workation' city has year-round sunshine and gorgeous golden beach - Daily Star",
    "text": "Christmas is over and we Brits are in for a long few months of cold, dark winter weather. But, those of us lucky enough to be able to get away for a short time will surely be looking for places to fly to that offer sunshine and warmer days. Luckily, there’s one town in Europe that’s been named one of the sunniest spots on the continent – and it’s also a great place for \"workations\", according to Holidu . A workation is when you hop on a flight abroad but don’t need to take time off work while out there as you can work remotely perhaps from your balcony, villa or by the pool. Valencia, in Spain, is the perfect spot for those looking for both sun and a good place to work for a short while (so long as it complies with working abroad regulations). The city sees average temperature highs of 16C in January meaning it’s pleasantly sunny and warm. Meanwhile in August the weather is much hotter at a blissful high of 31C. READ MORE: Lesser-known Greek island has white beaches, castles, seals and stays from £4.50pp READ MORE: Lesser-known island has £1 cocktails, £5 hotels and beaches that rival the Maldives Not only that, but the historic city is also right on the coat with a huge white sand beach in the middle of town and bright blue water. Palm trees sway on the streets and the pretty red roofed white buildings mean it’s a very romantic city for holidaymakers to get lost in. Of course for those lunch breaks and after-work adventures, the city is teeming with fun things to do. The most famous is the science and arts museum Ciudad de las Artes y las Ciencias where you can stare out of the huge windows at the water surrounding the building. It’s considered one of the 12 treasures of Spain and costs just £7.55 to enter and watch the laser shows, visit the planetarium and observe the avant-garde architecture. You can also see operas, concerts and performances art the Palau de les Arts. Alternatively, wander the medieval streets and admire the many churches, towers, cathedral and plazas that fill the streets and draw the eyes. Or, head over to L'Oceanogràfic – an oceanarium where different marine habitats have been recreated. If you’re willing to pay a little more then you can join a guided tour of the caves of San Jose via boat. Or, take a catamaran cruise to see the sunset. You can also spend a day out exploring waterfalls and thermal springs. Just make sure you bring your swimwear as you’ll be hopping in the warm water to enjoy swimming in the sunshine. Fancy going out for dinner? You should head to the Old Town where you can enjoy all the wine and tapas you like as you hop from bar to bar, while Get Your Guide also offers tapas and wine tour of the area plus you’ll dine in an 11th Century monument. Anyone who fancies a bit more exercise can go on a guises hike in the natural paradise that is Montanejos. Or, go on a jeep safari in the mountains. The stunning city has plenty of nightlife to enjoy too from evening flamenco shows to nightclubs, techno temples and even one unusual spot called Latex that will blow you away. It really is a city with something for everyone from the pool loungers, to the always-on-the-go families and those who like to stay up late! The city is also great value for money for us Brits. A flight, according to Skyscanner , will set you back from just £26 for a return. While a pint when you arrive will set you back an average of £3.64 which isn’t the cheapest but is well below many spots in the UK and, if you want a few bottles at your villa you can find them at the supermarket from 81p. You’ll be able to make savings on accommodation too if you choose wisely. Those who want to save as much as possible can book a bed in a dorm hostel for around £24 a night according to booking.com. That’s not for everyone though so the cheapest private space we could find was a double room at Limin Hostel Capsules at a cost of £34 a night. You can also get a double room at the ibis budget Valencia Centro Puerto from about £50 a night.",

    "text": "Micropolveri oltre i limiti per quasi due mesi nel 2023 Arpa: quest’anno il pm10 è stato oltre la soglia dei 50 microgrammi per 58 giorni, sette in meno dell’anno scorso Se non altro, quest’anno andrà meglio dell’anno scorso. Stiamo parlando della qualità dell’aria a Mantova sul fronte del pm10, le micropolveri di maggiori dimensioni. Fino a mercoledì scorso i giorni di supero della soglia dei 50 microgrammi per metro cubo d’aria sono stati 58. L’anno scorso si era arrivati a 65: dunque, anche se fino al 31 dicembre le micropolveri dovessero addensarsi nell’aria del capoluogo si rimarrà comunque al di sotto dei 65 giorni. Oltre i limiti C’è da tirare un sospiro di sollievo? No, perché 58 giorni di sforamento del limite significa aver respirato aria malata ben oltre i trentacinque giorni all’anno imposti dall’Unione Europea. E perché questa situazione va avanti da tempo. Basti pensare che nel 2021 i giorni in cui il pm10 superava la soglia dei 50 microgrammi erano stati 55. Esaminando la qualità dell’aria respirata nel capoluogo negli ultimi dieci giorni, sempre secondo i dati Arpa, si evince che dal 18 al 27 dicembre i superi sono stati sei. È dal giorno di Natale che il pm10 è oltre i 50 microgrammi: il 25 dicembre era a 53.4, per Santo Stefano a 64 e il 27 a 61.2. Se anche ieri si fosse superato il limite oggi scatterebbero le misure di limitazione del traffico dopo che la Regione, in settembre, aveva abbassato i limiti temporali. Meglio dell’anno prima Eppure, secondo l’ultimo rapporto sulla qualità dell’aria di Arpa, in Lombardia, e quindi in provincia di Mantova, i dati 2022 (gli ultimi completi disponibili) hanno confermato «il trend in miglioramento su base pluriennale per pm10, pm2.5 (il particolato più sottile) e biossido di azoto (NO2), riconducibile a una progressiva riduzione negli anni delle emissioni, seppur in lieve rialzo rispetto al 2021». In tutte le postazioni, però, la concentrazione media annuale di pm10 non ha mai superato il limite medio annuale di 40 microgrammi. Per quanto riguarda le concentrazioni di pm2.5, in tutte le postazioni è stato rispettato il limite per la media annuale di 25. Per l’ozono superata la soglia di informazione in tutte le stazioni, ma non è mai stata raggiunta quella di allarme. Rispettato ovunque il valore limite sulla media annua di NO2.",

    "text": "A malicious code gap has compromised certain D-Link routers. As support for these models has expired, they will no longer receive security patches. The manufacturer advises users to dispose of them and purchase a new device.\nAnzeige Dispose of VPN routers This is the result of a recent article from D-Link . The following models in all hardware revisions are affected:\nDSR-150, DSR 150N DSR-250, DSR-250N DSR-500N DSR-1000N There is no further information about the vulnerability so far; a CVE number is also not yet known. Attacks should be possible remotely and without authentication. Accordingly, the hurdles for attacks do not appear to be very high. So far, there have been no reports of ongoing attacks. However, owners of such devices should not hesitate too long before replacing them.\nApparently, D-Link has not yet revised the product website of the affected model DSR-250N and the device is still listed there as being under support. Unfortunately, neither the product description nor the 5-page data sheet of the successor model DSR250v2, which D-Link now recommends as a replacement, states how long updates will be available for the model. The EoL policy merely states: \"We normally give customers 3 months' notice\".\nCriminals and state attackers use EoL devices like this to build botnets , which they then use as a basis for their further activities. The router then becomes either a gateway for ransomware, a DDoS catapult or, as a residential proxy or operational relay box, an intermediate station with a trusted IP address. This is an acute danger for society as a whole.\nAnzeige It is therefore to be hoped that the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) will finally make a difference in this respect. It obliges manufacturers to take more responsibility and also brings manufacturer liability. The CRA has just been passed and will come into force across the EU on December 11:\n( des )\nDon't miss any news – follow us on Facebook , LinkedIn or Mastodon .\nThis article was originally published in German .

    "text": "El Servei Meteorològic de Cataluña ha activado decenas de avisos amarillos y naranja ante el riesgo de que la DANA que esta semana ha azotado España siga dejando lluvias torrenciales en el territorio durante los próximos días. Los pronósticos apuntan a que el temporal se seguirá extendiendo hasta como mínimo el domingo, por lo que se han activado varios avisos ante la posibilidad de que las lluvias dejen más de 100 litros por metro cuadrado en algunos puntos del litoral catalán. Por el momento, las zonas con más riesgo se concentran en el extremo sur, incluyendo el Tarragonès, el Baix Camp, el Priorat, Ribera d'Ebre, Terra Alta, Baix Ebre y Montsià. En Barcelona, se ha activado un aviso amarillo para viernes, sábado y domingo. Este viernes hay siete comarcas catalanas en alerta naranja por el paso de esta DANA. En el Montsià, Baix Ebre y Terra Alta, hay activo un aviso naranja por acumulación de lluvias en tanto que podrían superarse los 100 litros por metro cuadrado a lo largo de la jornada. También destaca otra alerta naranja por intensidad de las lluvias en toda la zona (desde el Tarragonès hasta el Baix Camp, el Priorat, Ribera d'Ebre), dado que entre este mediodía y la tarde podrían producirse descargas de hasta 40 litros en tan solo 30 minutos. En todas estas zonas, las autoridades piden a los residentes extremar las precauciones durante la jornada de este viernes. Este viernes también hay 14 comarcas más en alerta amarilla: el Barcelonès, Baix Llobregat, Vallès Occidental, Garraf, Alt Penedès, Anoia, Alt Camp, Baix Penedès, Conca de Barberà, Segarra, Urgell, Garrigues, Pla d'Urgell y Segrià. El aviso se extiende para toda la jornada del viernes y, en varios casos, también de cara al sábado. En estos puntos se esperan precipitaciones abundantes que en algunos casos podrían adquirir un carácter torrencial. Según datos de la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología, en el litoral y prelitoral de Barcelona se podrían registrar acumulaciones de hasta 20 litros por metro cuadrado en una hora. En el conjunto de España, este viernes hay cinco comunidades autónomas en alerta por el paso de la DANA y al menos un aviso rojo activado en el litoral de Huelva, donde se podrían dar acumulaciones de más de 140 litros por metro cuadrado en tan solo unas horas. En localidades como Cartaya ya se han acumulado más de 117 litros por metro cuadrado en menos de tres horas, de los cuales 70 en un hora. También se están registrando importantes trombas marinas asociadas a este evento. Los pronósticos sobre la evolución de esta DANA aún son inciertos pero, según los modelos más actualizados, todo apunta a que el temporal seguirá abriéndose paso durante el fin de semana. El domingo, de hecho, el Servei Meteorològic de Cataluña ha activado un aviso amarillo en todo el litoral y prelitoral catalán, desde el Alt Empordà hasta les Terres de l'Ebre, por intensidad de lluvias. Para entonces hay casi una veintena de comarcas en aviso amarillo y tres más, situadas en el extremo sur, en aviso naranja.",

    "text": "Trauernder Witwer von Anita Kupsch offenbart: „Hat mich nicht einmal mehr erkannt“\nNach jahrelanger Krankheit verstarb Schauspielerin Anita Kupsch mit 85 Jahren. Ihr Mann erzählt nun von den letzten Tagen, die sie miteinander teilten.\nBerlin – Als Arzthelferin Gabi Köhler in der ARD-Vorabendserie „Praxis Bülowbogen“ zauberte sich Anita Kupsch (†85) in die Herzen der Zuschauer. In ihren letzten Lebensjahren kämpfte die Schauspielerin unter anderem gegen Demenz und wurde liebevoll von ihrem Mann Klaus-Detlef Krahn (79) gepflegt. Der trauernde Witwer spricht nun über die letzten Tage, die er mit seiner Frau verbrachte.\nMann von Anita Kupsch war ihr wichtigster Halt\nAm 3. Juli starb Anita Kupsch in einer Berliner Pflegeeinrichtung. „Sie hat sich ja nur noch gequält und war ganz abgemagert“, offenbarte ihr Mann am Tag ihres Todes im Gespräch mit Bild. Beide waren ab 1987 verheiratet, für den TV-Star war es die zweite Ehe. Das plötzliche Ableben von Anita Kupsch kam für den Innenausstatter jedoch nicht unerwartet: „Es war absehbar, aber wenn es dann soweit ist, tut es unfassbar weh.“\nJahrelang pflegte Klaus-Detlef seine Anita, war ihre größte Stütze. Auch während ihrer Zeit in der Pflegeeinrichtung stand er ihr immer zur Seite. Er besuchte sie jeden Tag, so der Witwer gegenüber Die Aktuelle. Die letzten Tage mit seiner Liebsten waren aber auch für ihn nicht einfach – wegen der Demenz „hat sie mich nicht einmal mehr erkannt“, verrät er mit Tränen in den Augen.\nNicht nur Anita Kupsch: Witwer trauert um weiteres Familienmitglied\nAufgrund der Krankheit hatte Anita Kupsch lange zu leiden. „Die Demenz ist eine ganz schreckliche Krankheit“, klagt Klaus-Detlef. Seine Frau „war organisch in Ordnung, nur diese Demenz hat sie kaputtgemacht“. Für den Witwer ist der Tod seiner geliebten Frau aber nicht der einzige Verlust. „Erst am 7. Mai musste ich von meinem Bruder Abschied nehmen und jetzt von meiner Frau“, offenbarte er Bild.\nIn diesem Jahr mussten sich TV-Zuschauer bereits von einigen Promis verabschieden, darunter von NDR-Legende Carlo von Tiedemann (†81). Kürzlich fand seine Trauerfreier in Hamburg statt. Verwendete Quellen: bild.de, Die Aktuelle (29/2025)",
