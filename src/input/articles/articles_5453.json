Pero destacó que todos los estudios y análisis señalan que Tita-Techi es un área rica en recursos hidrocarburíferos.\nAdemás, la autoridad destacó el trabajo de Canacol Energy Colombia, la cual —explicó— comercializa el 30% de gas en ese país, por lo que tiene el respaldo para cumplir de manera óptima el contrato con YPFB.",

    "title": "Massive Recovery in Antarctica Sea Ice Unreported by Net Zero-Obsessed Mainstream Media - The Daily Sceptic",
    "text": "Remember all that alarmist guff about Antarctica sea ice recording lower levels in winter a couple of years ago? Georgina Rannard of the BBC wrote a story headed ‘ Antarctic sea ice at “mind-blowing” low alarms experts ‘, while Clive Cookson at the Financial Times gave us his suggestion that the area “faces a catastrophic cascade of extreme environmental events… that will affect the climate around the world ”. The scare story caravan has moved on to pastures new these days, not unrelated to the fact that at the end of 2024 the extent of sea ice in Antarctica was roughly the same as the 1981 to 2010 average. According to the U.S.-based National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC), “this provides a sharp illustration of the high variability of Antarctica sea ice extent”. It does indeed, and it also provides us with a classic case study of how a short-term natural variation, well understood by many scientists, is weaponised by activists in science, politics and journalism to induce mass climate psychosis with the aim of promoting the political Net Zero lunacy.\nThe less hysterical NSIDC would appear to be the same NSIDC that published a paper updated as recently as last July asking, “ has Antarctic sea ice hit a breaking point? ”. As the Daily Sceptic has reported in the past, Antarctica has been a bit of a disappointment to the climate cry-baby crowd since it has shown little warming for at least 70 years. “Now scientists are eager to know if climate change has finally caught up with Antarctica sea ice,” notes the NSIDC paper. Helpful as ever in the mission of preaching climate Armageddon, Rannard of the BBC provides us with an “experts say” quote: “Without its ice cooling the planet, Antarctica could transform from Earth’s refrigerator to a radiator.”\nInterestingly, the second author on the Rannard story was ‘data’ specialist Becky Dale who subsequently enrolled for the six-month sabbatical run by the Green Blob-funded Oxford Climate Journalism Network. This is a crash course in climate catastrophisation reporting. Previous participants have been asked to write about how fruits such as mangos are less tasty than in the past due to climate change. A recent speaker has called for “fines and imprisonment” for those expressing scepticism about “well supported” science.\nThe ’mind-blowing’ quote that made headlines around the world has been attributed to Dr. Walter Meier of the NSIDC. Dr Meier, reported Rannard and Dale, “is not optimistic that the sea ice will recover to a significant degree”. At the height of the scare, Meier claimed the 2023 winter dip was far outside anything we’ve seen. Again as we have reported in the Daily Sceptic , Dr. Meier seems a tad forgetful of the past work he has done on the obvious cyclical nature of Antarctica sea ice. Ten years earlier, Meier was part of a science team that unlocked the secrets of early Nimbus satellite photographs. These revealed significant Antarctica sea ice variability in the 1960s including a high in 1964, not seen again until 2014, and a low in 1966, similar to the recent dip. At the time, Meier commented that extreme ice highs and lows “are not that unusual”.\nDuring November and December 2024, mid to late spring in the Southern Hemisphere, the daily Antarctica sea ice loss was 140,000 square kilometres compared to 165,000 sq kms for the 1981-2010 average. By the end of December the sea ice extent was roughly around the average recorded in the 30 years to 2010. Now it seems the NSIDC is a re-convert to stressing long-term trends, noting that the 2016-2024 timeline “is too short to definitely determine that a regime shift has occurred”.\nPerhaps the NSIDC ought to mark the card of the British Antarctica Survey (BAS) team, who as late as May last year issued a press release claiming that the 2023 lows would be a one in 2,000 year event without climate change. Needless to say, this scaremongering twaddle was the product of a computer model. The model told the BAS that such “evidence” adds to existing observational evidence “that the last few years’ low sea ice could signal a lasting regime shift in the Southern Ocean”. More BS than BAS, the uncharitable might conclude.\nNeedless to say, the recent cyclical recovery in Antarctica sea ice has been ignored by mainstream media. It’s been a bad period for alarmists, coming so soon after years of record growth of coral on the Great Barrier Reef put an end to yet another profitable supply of constant alarums. Thankfully the BBC finds ever more obscure ways to keep the fast-fading Net Zero fantasy alive. Perhaps not as headline-grabbing as ice and coral, but it appears that a bumble bee has been sighted recently in Scotland. It was claimed that critters were “nest building” and this was due to climate change . Britannica does not find such a sighting very surprising, noting that in winter when the temperature outside rises above 10°C, bees will leave the hive momentarily to relieve themselves of waste. Possibly with a cheery wave and a “back in three, going for a wee”.\nAll of the confusion – designed to constantly promote Net Zero – arises because narrative-driven commentators assign most weather and climate changes to humans adding trace amounts of a trace gas into the atmosphere. It leaves little room for explaining the role of natural variation in the changing climate. Antarctica has not warmed for at least 70 years and a recent paper found that the summer temperature had shown a dramatic 1°C fall from 1977-1999, followed by a pause since the turn of the century. Another paper found that Antarctica sea ice extent had slowly increased since the start of continuous satellite recordings in 1979.\nThis case study of the recent hyped sea ice alarm in Antarctica shows how the scientific process is torn up and ridiculous claims, often produced by computer models, are made on the flimsiest of short-term evidence and observation. Lectures on disregarding short-term variations only resume when normal, and often cyclical, trends reappear and follow inconvenient directions.\nChris Morrison is the Daily Sceptic ’s Environment Editor.",

    "title": "Deutsche Schulen: Schüler-Vertreter offenbaren „gravierende Missstände\"",
    "text": "Deutsche Schulen: Schüler-Vertreter offenbaren „gravierende Missstände“\nEine Sprecherin der Bundesschülerkonferenz beschreibt bei Ippen.Media, woran es in Deutschlands Schulen fehlt - samt Forderungen an Kanzler Friedrich Merz.\nBerlin - Am Dienstag (24. Juni) war es so weit. Die schwarz-rote Bundesregierung aus CDU/CSU und SPD hat ihren Entwurf für den Bundeshaushalt 2025 vorgelegt. Darin sind im Umfeld von Ukraine-Krieg und Russland-Aggression nicht zuletzt immense Verteidigungsausgaben zur Aufrüstung der Bundeswehr enthalten.\nSchulen in Deutschland: Thema Bildung ging im Bundestagswahlkampf unter\nBis zu 95 Milliarden Euro sollen in die deutschen Streitkräfte fließen. Die Verteidigungspolitik war schließlich auch ein zentrales Thema im Wahlkampf zur Bundestagswahl 2025. Ganz im Gegensatz zur Bildung allgemein und zu Schulen im Speziellen. Dabei wird seit Jahren über eklatante Versäumnisse in der Ausstattung deutscher Bildungseinrichtungen berichtet.\nZum Beispiel bei ausreichend und zeitgemäßen digitalen Geräten. Im Umfeld von Bundeshaushalt und schwarz-roten Plänen für Deutschland hat die Sprecherin der Bundesschülerkonferenz auf Anfrage der Frankfurter Rundschau von Ippen.Media jetzt „gravierende Missstände“ benannt. Sie stellt eindringliche Forderungen an die Koalition von Bundeskanzler Friedrich Merz (CDU) und Bundesfinanzminister Lars Klingbeil (SPD).\nBildung in Deutschland: Expertin berichtet von Missständen an deutschen Schulen\n„Die Missstände an deutschen Schulen sind vielerorts gravierend und sie ziehen sich durch nahezu alle Bereiche: Vom akuten Lehrkräftemangel, über unzureichende digitale Infrastruktur bis hin zu baulichen Mängeln, die zum Teil gesundheitsgefährdend sind. Es ist keine Ausnahme, sondern bittere Realität, dass Schülerinnen und Schüler in Räumen mit Schimmelbefall, undichten Fenstern und defekten Böden unterrichtet werden“, erklärt Tilda Skerra – „Wenn überhaupt Lehrkräfte zur Verfügung stehen“. Digitale Endgeräte würden ebenso fehlen wie stabiles WLAN oder zeitgemäße Lernumgebungen, schildert sie.\nSkerra ist Mitglied im Bundessekretariat der Bundesschülerkonferenz (BSK), die sich als Vertretung von Schülerinnen und Schülern der Bildungspolitik in Deutschland annimmt. Und zwar bei Themen von überregionaler Bedeutung. So sollen Anliegen von Schülern und Schülerinnen bundesweit Gehör verschafft werden, während für das Thema Bildung im deutschen Föderalismus vorrangig die Bundesländer zuständig sind.\nEs ist keine Ausnahme, sondern bittere Realität, dass Schüler*innen in Räumen mit Schimmelbefall, undichten Fenstern und defekten Böden unterrichtet werden.\nDie Kulturhoheit der Länder im Bildungsbereich ist im Grundgesetz verankert. Der Bund nimmt durch Fördermittel und Subventionen, etwa bei Bauvorhaben, aber sehr wohl erheblichen Einfluss auf die Bildungspolitik und kann die Länder je nach Gewichtung des Themas bei der Budgetierung erheblich entlasten - oder eben nicht.\nSondervermögen der schwarz-roten Koalition: Schüler-Vertreter fordern viel mehr Geld von Merz\nNach Ansicht von Skerra und ihrer Mitstreiter kommen aus Berlin zu wenige Signale und vor allem zu wenig Geld, um frühere Versäumnisse anzugehen und bestenfalls zu beheben. „Wir fordern, dass mindestens zehn Prozent des geplanten Infrastruktur-Sondervermögens, also rund 50 Milliarden Euro, zweckgebunden in die Sanierung und Modernisierung von Schulen investiert werden“, erklärt Skerra unserer Redaktion. „Darüber hinaus braucht es ein langfristig angelegtes Förderprogramm, das die bauliche, digitale und strukturelle Weiterentwicklung unserer Schulen strategisch begleitet.“\nFerner müsse der schon unter der früheren Ampel-Bundesregierung so bezeichnete „DigitalPakt deutlich aufgestockt und ausgebaut werden, um Bildung endlich nachhaltig im 21. Jahrhundert anzukommen zu lassen“, meint die Expertin. Zu weiteren Forderungen der Bundesschülerkonferenz gehört die Sicherstellung der Finanzierung von verpflichtenden Fort- und Weiterbildungsbereichen, was etwa die Themen „mentale Gesundheit“ und „digitale Lehrformate“ betreffe. Und ein realistischer Betreuungsschlüssel, wie es die BSK-Sprecherin beschreibt: „Mindestens eine Schulsozialarbeiterin oder ein Schulsozialarbeiter auf 300 Schüler*innen und auf 150 Schüler*innen eine Schulpsychologin oder ein Schulpsychologe je Bundesland.“\nLars Klingbeil stellt Bundeshaushalt 2025 vor: Bildungsausgaben steigen leicht\nDas alles gebe es bislang nicht. Die Investitionen in die Bildung, die Vize-Kanzler Klingbeil im Bundeshaushalt 2025 vorstellte, dürften bei den Experten aus dem Bereich jedoch für überschaubare Begeisterung sorgen. Laut Website des Bundesfinanzministeriums entfallen von 488,60 Milliarden Euro aus dem Regierungsentwurf gerade mal 4,57 Prozent auf die Themen Bildung und Forschung - rund 22,31 Milliarden Euro.\nDas ist ein leichter Anstieg. Zum Vergleich: Die gescheiterte Ampel-Bundesregierung hatte für 2024 noch 21,49 Milliarden Euro eingeplant. Laut Bundesfinanzministerium sollen aus dem Sondervermögen zudem insgesamt 6,5 Milliarden Euro in Investitionen für die Kindertagesbetreuung und in die digitale Bildung fließen. In einem Zeitraum bis 2029. Von den geforderten 50 Milliarden Euro der BSK ist das weit entfernt. (pm)",

    "text": "The upcoming year will be filled with blessings, at least that is what the numerical sequence of this New Year’s Eve date suggests. If you take a closer look at the date, written as 12/31/23 or even 123123, you might see an angel number, which are repeating number sequence s, often used as a guide for deeper spiritual exploration. The numerical sequences can range anywhere from 000 to 999 , with each number having a distinct meaning and energy, USA Today previously reported. The once-in-a-century date, which won’t be seen again on our calenders until Dec. 31, 2123, marks a new beginning. One, that asks us to “transform and evolve with the times and in the right place to embrace what is coming to us,” according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac website. The date has also sparked an online trend, with TikTok users creating videos on the significance of the number and merchandise commemorating the date selling online, including on platforms like Amazon , eBay and Etsy , the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA Today Network reported. Here’s what we know about the date. Numerology is an ancient esoteric science that deals with numbers and letters and the energy, intention and vibration behind them, professional numerologist Novalee Wilder shared with USA Today earlier this month. \"Before there was even language, there were numbers,\" she said. \"Before we had named things, we had counted them, and we had assigned meaning to that count.\" The numbers that make up the angel number are just as important as the whole number, especially when you are trying to determine the vibration and intention behind the number. Professional astrologer Narayana Montúfar told Farmer’s Almanac that the “Number 1 brings the very spark of initiation, 2 focuses on building, and 3 is related to the concept of creation. Together, the sequence of these three numbers speaks of the spark of initiation that seeks to build a new creation.” If you add all the numbers that make up the date 123123 together, you will come up with 12. The number 12 in numerology can symbolize spiritual enlightenment, with potential for the day to deliver epiphanies and “aha” moments for individuals and society at large, the website stated. FYI: How to keep your pets calm during New Year's Eve fireworks If you are an angel number enthusiast, there are a few key dates you might want to keep in mind as 2024 rapidly approaches. A palindrome, not unlike an angel number, is a term typically reserved for words or phrases that are spelled the same way backward as they are forward. Words like level, kayak, civic, and radar are among some of the most common palindromes, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac. Numerical sequences seen in dates or times can also be palindromes, the most well-recognized ones being 3/20/23 or 11:11 , the website stated.
