    "text": "Your iPhone 15 finally comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable that can charge all of your devices, but you still need a power adapter—something small, portable, reliable, and fast. We’ve got the perfect one for you: Amazon is selling Apple’s 35W Dual USB-C Port Compact Power Adapter for $40, a savings of $19 (when you click the coupon on the page) and the lowest price we’ve ever seen. This power adapter is a little pricey at $59, but for $40 it checks all the boxes: a compact design, downward-facing ports for easy cable management, and folding prongs for extra portability. Either port can deliver 35 watts of juice to your device for charging a MacBook Air or iPad alone, and it has enough power to fast charge an iPhone and AirPods or Apple Watch at the same time. There are plenty of other lower-priced power adapters that offer the same ports and wattage, but many of them split power between the two ports regardless of how many devices are plugged in. Plus you’ll get the peace of mind knowing Apple certifies it for use with its products—along with a great price. So go grab one and never worry about bringing the right charger again.",

    "title": "'Zero plans to go anywhere': Rickie Fowler shoots down LIV Golf, dishes on sponsorship change - Top World News Today",
    "text": "Rickie Fowler’s game returned to being so fine in 2023. He improved more than 100 spots to No. 14 in the final FedEx Cup standings. Yet at the start of the new season at The Sentry in Hawaii something was different – he was missing the logos of two of his longtime sponsors, Farmers Insurance, which was on the right side of his hat, and Rocket Mortgage, which was on the right sleeve of his shirt. To quote one of the signature lines ad lines, what does that even mean, Rick? For some, it fueled speculation that Fowler would be the next Tour pro to jump to LIV Golf for a lucrative guaranteed payday. No doubt that LIV would fancy adding Fowler, one of the game’s most popular players, to its growing stable of big-name players. But Fowler confirmed in a phone interview with Golfweek that he had “zero plans to go anywhere.” So, what happened to his long-running relationship with Farmers, which sponsors the Farmers Insurance Open later this month at Torrey Pines in San Diego? “My contract was up and I was told they weren’t looking to renew or extend,” Fowler said, noting the company has undergone a change in leadership at the top. It’s not uncommon for a new CEO to want to put his own spin on how the company spends its marketing dollars, especially if that leader isn’t a golfer or golf fan. “It was a good fit with them taking over at Torrey, a tournament I loved and was closest to where I grew up. I loved doing the fun commercials with them over the years, it was a great partnership, and it was their decision to scale back.” But Fowler said he hasn’t parted ways with Rocket Mortgage, the Detroit-based mortgage lender, which serves as the title sponsor of the Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit. In July, Fowler won the Rocket Mortgage Classic to end his winless spell. His deal with Rocket Mortgage expired at the end of the year, too. “We have something in the works to move forward but it hasn’t been finalized yet,” he said and predicted the mortgage company’s logo would soon return to his shirt. “I think there is a good chance we will have the logo and move forward with the partnership there.” Fowler was unaware of banter on social media that led some observers to make the leap that the missing logos meant he was LIV-bound. “You don’t have to worry about that,” he said. “Seeing how much work the guys on the (PGA Tour) board, especially being around (Patrick) Cantlay during the off-season a little bit and leading up to this event, I’ve never seen a person be on the phone so much. These guys are pouring a lot of time and effort into it. I was on the PAC last year but have tried to stay out of the way because the guys that are in there, I trust. With Jordan, Cantlay, Tiger and the other guys, I’ve just trusted that we’re all going to end up in a good spot and I have zero plans to go anywhere.” He termed it a sad state of affairs that players repeatedly have to declare their loyalty to the Tour at every turn, but he realizes that’s the current environment, especially after seeing Jon Rahm bolt for LIV . “I don’t check social media a whole lot,” Fowler said. “I kind of run everything through Instagram but rarely see stuff talked about on there. I guess it’s the day and age we live in. There’s only so much you can believe or trust because anything can be put out there. I’m real excited for what’s coming for me and for the Tour and all the time and effort these guys have been putting into it.” Fowler, who has been one of the most in-demand players for endorsements isn’t necessarily scaling back his involvement in endorsing products or serving as a company spokesman – he said he remains open for business for the right opportunities. “I’m not in a position where I need to go out and slap a logo on. I’m not going to do a deal unless it’s something I believe in and want to do,” he said. “Time is valuable and I don’t want to over-extend myself. Ten years ago, single me, it’s a lot easier to use that time for work-related stuff. Now, I want to make sure it’s worthwhile and with the right people. I don’t want to be a billboard or Nascar driver type of thing, but I do want to have a good, core group of partners.” The big loser in all of this is the Fowler fans in San Diego. He’s scheduled to play the American Express and is planning to skip the Farmers Insurance Open. With the way the schedule is set up, he’s expecting to play the next two signature events – AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and Genesis Invitational – and in between he’s going to return to the WM Phoenix Open where he’s a past champion and has formed a deep bond with the Thunderbirds and the event. “I rarely like to play more than three weeks in a row so it’s just how it all worked out,” he said.",

    "text": "The man with a magnetic smile beamed as he stared down at the graduation certificate in his hands. It’s coming up on two years since the arrest that landed him in jail.\nThe arrest, it would turn out, gave him access to what he needed and helped him to earn this framed proof of fortitude.\n“Before I got arrested, I was feeling helplessness, and I didn’t know where to get help,” Johannes McCoy said. “So I was really lost, and I ended up going down a bad path. In a way, I am kind of thankful that I went down that path, because I was able to get the help that I needed from this program.”\nThis week, McCoy became one of the latest to graduate Behavioral Health Court, a specialized San Diego Superior Court program offered to a fraction of felony criminal defendants who have a diagnosis of a serious mental illness — usually schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder.\nIt’s a collaborative court , one in which prosecutors, defense attorneys, probation officers and treatment providers work together to craft specialized plans for each participant.\nIt’s a small program — roughly 100 spots — and a very intense one, providing participants with group housing, counseling and wrap-around support, including medication. It runs a minimum of 18 months, although several people need more time. This program offers a chance for participants to stabilize, gives them the tools to navigate life. Failure most likely means a trip back to jail, and for some, prison, to serve time for the crime that landed them here to begin with. Success wipes the conviction clean.\nJohannes McCoy after graduating Behavioral Health Court on Monday. (Ana Ramirez / The San Diego Union-Tribune) On Monday, McCoy and 25 others gathered to celebrate their completion of the very demanding offering.\nThe program, McCoy said, “gave me the structure that I needed. They gave me the guidance that I was looking for.”\nThis spring’s graduating class is the largest in the collaborative court’s 16-year history. When each of them started this program, they faced a felony charge. Now, they are pursuing education and securing jobs. One person is enrolled in an automobile repair program at a local community college, and another is working on a master’s degree at San Diego State University.\nDespite its successes, Behavioral Health Court is under a cloud.\nIn recent months, the District Attorney’s Office has been at odds with Judge Cindy Davis, who oversees the program. Prosecutors, displeased with some of her decisions, are pushing Davis to recuse herself from mental health cases. She has refused, save for their first request, although the judge who inherited that case sided with Davis and handed the case back to her.\nThe ensuing tug-of-war has landed in a state appeals court.\nWith the behind-the-scenes legal battle, Behavioral Health Court has taken a body blow. No new defendants have been accepted into the program since December. Some 36 participants in the court program remain.\nMonday’s celebration, at a luncheon at the University of San Diego, reflected none of that turmoil. Davis spoke to the crowd about the growth and successes of each graduate, highlighting their hard-won victories as they pushed through the requirements and challenges.\nShe knows each of the participants. Every month they must stand in her courtroom and talk with her, a hearing that serves as a check-in and a guardrail. That, Davis said, is where they “get to travel the journey together.”\n“This is an example of what works,” Davis told the gathered audience of graduates and families. Behavioral Health Court is “transformative,” she said. “I see where we start and where we end up. I’m so proud of all of you, and so amazed at the transformations.”\nLast month in court, two of the new graduates stood in Davis’ courtroom as she wiped from their records the charge that initially landed them there. Davis hugged them. One of them wore a nice suit and brought his mom.\nOn Monday, the judge told stories of individual graduates. One man had emerged as a cheerleader for others in his group home, she said. A woman had suffered an “incredible loss” during her time in the program but persevered.\nShe also read a statement from Deputy Public Defender Melissa Tralla, who is assigned to the court but was unable to attend Monday. Tralla praised the graduates’ perseverance as “extraordinary.”\n“For those of us not personally afflicted by mental issues, we can only begin to understand your struggles,” Tralla wrote. “Through your monthly court hearings, you’ve shared experiences of hearing voices that urge you to do harmful things, seeing things that others don’t, battling drug addiction, facing the scars of physical and sexual abuse and numerous other traumatic lived experiences.\n“I cannot imagine what you go through each day and how difficult this journey has been.”\nGregory Sizemore speaks after graduating Behavioral Health Court on Monday, April 21, 2025 in San Diego, California. (Ana Ramirez / The San Diego Union-Tribune) Each graduate took the stage, and most thanked the team who helped them through, a small army of counselors and housing providers and probation officers and more. One graduate shared that he found help through group therapy and people who listen “when there’s the confusing parts of life that I don’t quite understand.”\nAt the tables, family members sat proudly next to graduates. One brought her children and grandchildren. In the back of the room, 31-year-old Gregory Sizemore sat with his sister, his mother and grandmother. He grinned down at his certificate. His grandmother quietly reached over, put her hand on his knee and smiled.\nOriginally Published: April 23, 2025 at 2:44 PM PDT",

    "text": "Apple is set to release its quarterly earnings on July 31, 2025, with analysts expecting a 4.2% increase in revenue to US$89.34 billion for the April-June period.\nThe company faces ongoing challenges from US tariffs, competition in China, and a delayed entry into the AI sector.\nApple has shifted some iPhone production to India to reduce the impact of potential US tariffs on foreign-made devices.\nAnalysts estimate the financial hit from tariffs could be less than US$900 million, below earlier projections.\niPhone sales are expected to have increased by 2.2% in the fiscal third quarter, partly due to higher demand in China, where quarterly sales rose 8%, fueled in part by the recent 618 shopping festival, according to Counterpoint Research.\nSales of other Apple devices are projected to slow, while services revenue is expected to rise to 10.7% of total revenue, according to LSEG.\nApple’s slow rollout of new AI features has led to concerns about its competitiveness in the fast-growing AI market.\n🔗 Source: Reuters\n🧠 Food for thought 1️⃣ Major supply chain shifts require years of strategic planning, not reactive moves Apple’s production pivot demonstrates how supply chain diversification is a long-term strategic initiative rather than a quick tariff response.\nThe company expects that by June 2025, most U.S.-bound iPhones will originate from India, with over 50% of American iPhone sales coming from Indian manufacturing facilities 1 2 .\nThis shift has already driven a 240% increase in Indian-made smartphones in the second quarter, largely attributed to Apple’s supply chain transition 3 .\nThe timeline reveals that meaningful supply chain diversification takes years to execute effectively, requiring companies to begin strategic shifts well before external pressures become critical.\nApple’s approach of maintaining China as a manufacturing hub for non-U.S. markets while developing alternative locations shows how global companies can hedge geopolitical risks without abandoning established production capabilities 1 .\n2️⃣ Corporate political influence creates uneven tariff impacts across business sizes Apple’s success in securing tariff exemptions highlights how large corporations can leverage political access to protect their margins while smaller competitors absorb the full cost burden.\nApple received exemptions on key products including the Apple Watch shortly after CEO Tim Cook’s direct meetings with the Trump administration, demonstrating the effectiveness of high-level political engagement 4 .\nThis stands in stark contrast to smaller businesses like Mid Continent Nail Corp., which reported 25% cost increases and subsequent layoffs when unable to secure similar relief 4 .\nThe tariffs often act as a selective tax that disproportionately affects companies without substantial lobbying resources or political connections.\nApple’s US$350 billion US investment commitment, announced alongside its tariff relief efforts, illustrates how large corporations can package policy requests with broader economic promises 5 .\nRecent Apple developments",

    "text": "Erling Haaland is going to be out for a while longer.\nManchester City head coach Pep Guardiola said that the star forward could be out until the end of January as he continues to battle a foot injury.\nHaaland has already missed City’s past six games and after his side defeated Everton on Wednesday, Guardiola said the Norwegian would not be back in the near future.\n“[Haaland] is training alone but he is not training with the team,” Guardiola said. “Kevin [De Bruyne] is training with the team, but Erling is not yet. It is a question of when the pain will disappear.\n“We hope he will be back in January, but a stress on the bone is so painful. He is not like a guy like Phil Foden with smaller skin — Erling is huge.\n“He will be back and play. But it is up to the doctors. The doctors come every morning and say this player is available and this is not.”\nHaaland set a single-season Premier League goals record last season with 36, and currently leads all players in the division with 14 goals.\nThe news was better on De Bruyne, who has not played since suffering a hamstring injury during the opening game of the season.\n“Yeah he is close,” Guardiola said. “Today he had fatigue. We have to be careful. He is training with us and he is so positive. Soon he will be back.\n“I would love [him] to play the next game or Huddersfield, but it is important to keep fit for a long time.”\nCity returns to the pitch on Saturday with a league match against Sheffield United, before a FA Cup match against Huddersfield on January 7.\nRelated Premier League 2023-24 top scorers: Tracking the Golden Boot race Sorry folks, Kevin De Bruyne didn't write a song with Drake (he's a big fan though) The top 25 highest-paid Premier League players in 2023-24\nFollow all of Pro Soccer Wire's Premier League coverage right here.",
