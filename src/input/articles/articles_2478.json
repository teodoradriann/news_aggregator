    "text": "India’s vibrant Holi, the festival of colours, coincides this year with a concerning trend — spiking temperatures.\nA new study by Climate Central sees the likelihood of unprecedented hot weather during late March/early April this year compared to the 1970s. Click here to follow our WhatsApp channel\nThis roughly translates into shortening of the spring season with summers arriving early and staying longer. This year, Holi will be celebrated on March 25.\nThe ‘Heat Trends for Holi’ report underscores the concerning probability of temperatures surpassing 40°C during the Holi festival.\nALSO READ: Ganges, Brahmaputra among major river basins to feel climate change impact\nBack in the 1970s, only Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and Bihar had the likelihood of 5 per cent to encounter such extreme heat.\nHowever, in the current year, this risk expands significantly to encompass nine states.\nIn addition to the original three states, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and Andhra Pradesh now face the threat of experiencing these dangerously-high temperatures. Recent findings from Climate Central reveal a concerning trend of rising temperatures in India and the disappearance of Spring.\nA study published just days ago highlights this phenomenon, indicating a swift transition from winter to summer-like conditions across many parts of Northern India, notably during February.\nThis shift, attributed to human-induced climate change, fuelled by burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas, has been observed through significant warming trends from 1970 to 2023.\nAlarmingly, all regions experienced notable warming in February, with nine states witnessing differences of over 2 degrees Celsius between January and February.\nALSO READ: Ganges, Brahmaputra among major river basins to feel climate change impact\nThe ‘Heat Trends for Holi’ study also reveals a rise in average temperatures across India in March and April.\nJammu and Kashmir has seen the most dramatic warming, with a 2.8°C temperature increase since 1970. This warming translates into a heightened risk of extreme heat events.\nAlso Read From the US to France: Here's how the world is celebrating Ram temple Delhi's air quality 'very poor', min temperature remains below 7 degrees ICC World Cup 2023: Bumrah on Rashford-style celebration; watch video Delhi's air quality 'very poor' on Monday as minimum temperature slips Delhi AQI continues to be very poor, maximum temperature below normal SC transfers batch of pending pleas against IT rules 2021 to Delhi HC ED required to furnish grounds of arrest to accused in writing, says SC Looking at setting targets on offshore mineral mining: Mines secretary Rewari factory blast: Three more succumb to injuries, death toll reaches 10 Delhi maintains revenue surplus despite dent in liquor taxes since 2022-23 Experts attribute this trend to human-caused climate change. Andrew Pershing, vice-president for science, Climate Central, points to the “abrupt transition” from winter to hot conditions and the long-term warming trend as clear signs of climate change impact.\n“There has been an abrupt transition from winter-like temperatures to much warmer conditions now. After the strong warming trend observed in February, March is also likely to follow the same pattern,” Pershing said.\nThe risk extends beyond state boundaries. Over 37 major cities now have at least a 1 per cent chance of witnessing temperatures above 40°C during Holi.\nNotably, 11 cities have a 10 per cent or greater probability.\nBilaspur in Chhattisgarh tops the list with a daunting 31 per cent chance, a 2.5-fold increase over the past data period.\nTopics : Climate Change Holi holi celebrations Earth temperature Don't miss the most important news and views of the day.

This move aligns seamlessly with the brand's recent rebranding efforts and its deep-seated commitment to sustainability. \"Our new aluminum bottle is more than just a packaging innovation; it's a testament to our dedication to the planet and our customers,\" a company spokesperson shared. \"We're not just meeting a market demand; we're setting a new standard for the industry.\"\nStrategic Growth and Market Impact\nThe launch of the resealable aluminum bottle comes at a time when Perfect Hydration is experiencing unprecedented growth. With velocities that not only outpace other alkaline waters but also surpass the overall bottled water segment by 51%, the brand is on a clear upward trajectory. This growth is a reflection of a market that craves healthier, more sustainable options and views Perfect Hydration as a leader in this space. The new 16 oz. bottle is expected to hit the shelves backed by a comprehensive marketing strategy, poised to meet and stimulate further demand. Industry experts predict that this launch will not only cater to sustainably minded consumers but also influence other brands to prioritize eco-friendly packaging solutions.\nThe Consumer at the Heart of Innovation\nAt the core of Perfect Hydration's product development strategy lies a deep understanding of its customers' needs and desires. The new aluminum bottle, with its unique pack size and resealability feature, is a direct response to the growing demand for products that fit a dynamic, on-the-go lifestyle without sacrificing environmental values. \"We've listened to our customers, and they want options that are not just good for them but also good for the planet,\" said the spokesperson. \"Our new aluminum bottle is designed to offer the best of both worlds - perfect hydration in a convenient, eco-friendly package.\" By focusing on sustainability without compromising on convenience, Perfect Hydration is setting a new benchmark for consumer-centric innovation in the bottled water industry.\nIn conclusion, Perfect Hydration Alkaline Water's launch of the 16 oz. resealable aluminum bottle represents a significant leap forward in sustainable packaging.
