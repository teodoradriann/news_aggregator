    "title": "Met Éireann issues bank holiday weekend weather warning with risk of flooding and damage to temporary structures such as tents",
    "text": "Met Éireann has issued a yellow weather warning for the upcoming bank holiday weekend and forecast &quot;impactful&quot; weather for this Bank Holiday weekend, with heavy rain and localised flooding in places. &quot;Heavy rain coupled with strong and gusty southerly winds, especially in exposed areas. Potential impacts: Localised flooding; Damage to temporary structures; Difficult travelling conditions and poor visibility,” Met Éireann said. The warning for Clare, Kerry, Galway and Mayo will last from 8pm Sunday night until midday on bank holiday Monday. It will be mostly cloudy this morning while the east of the country will see some bright spells. Some parts might expect a little light rain and drizzle in places. Meanwhile, a spell of persistent rain might turn heavy at times, moving in along the west coast and spreading eastwards across the country in the morning and afternoon. The rain is expected to become lighter as it moves across eastern parts this afternoon while the western parts will see a clearance to mainly dry weather with sunshine. It will become clear later for all parts, reaching the east coast in the evening. Temperatures will range from 17 to 23C on Friday, while it will be the warmest in the east. It might turn fresher and breezy as the rain clears. Tonight will be largely dry, with long clear spells and just a few showers in western and northwestern coastal areas. The night will be cooler and fresher than the recent nights, with temperatures dropping to 8 and 12C. The Bank Holiday weekend will start off with a bright day on Saturday, with good spells of sunshine and a lot of dry weather. However, the north and the west might see scattered showers at times. Temperatures will be 16 to 19 or 20C, with fresher winds in western coastal parts. Saturday night will be largely dry and clear but the cloud will thicken from the west of the country, with some patchy outbreaks of light rain and drizzle spreading eastwards overnight. The east and south will mostly likely remain dry. Temperatures will range from 10 to 14C, with possible fresh winds along the west coast later at night. Sunday morning will bring some bright spells in the east and south, however it will remain cloudy and dry for most parts, apart from a little patchy rain and drizzle. However, heavy and persistent rain will move in along the west coast by early afternoon, spreading to most parts by evening. Meanwhile, some southeastern parts may escape largely dry. Met Éireann has warned of possible localised flooding, especially across Connacht and west Munster. Temperatures on Sunday will range from 16 to 20C but it will be a blustery day, with possible strong and gusty winds in coastal parts of the west and south. Sunday night will see further spells of heavy rain, which might be thundery, bringing a continued chance of spot flooding. Bank Holiday Monday will have a cloudy morning, with further spells of heavy thundery rain, especially across the midlands, east and southeast. Met Éireann has said there is uncertainty around how fast the rain will clear but it looks like a clearance to mainly dry, bright weather will move into the northwest and west by early morning. It will later extend to most places later in the day. The rain might linger in the eastern and southern parts for much of the day. Monday will be humid with the rain and will turn fresher as it clears, with temperatures of 18 and up to 22C. Any lingering rain in the east and south will clear overnight while the north and west will see scattered showers. Monday night will be fresh, with temperatures of 9 and 11C.

    "text": "A video of Taimur Ali Khan, son of Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan, asking paparazzi to stop filming has gone viral. The language used by Taimur has sparked trolling, with netizens questioning Kareena Kapoor Khan's parenting. Taimur, the son of Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan and actress Kareena Kapoor Khan, is a paparazzi favorite. A video of Taimur Ali Khan asking paparazzi to turn off their cameras has gone viral, with his language sparking controversy and debate online. In the resurfaced Instagram video, Taimur Ali Khan is seen playing when he notices the cameras. As the paparazzi shift their focus from Kareena Kapoor Khan to Taimur, security personnel intervene, asking them to stop filming. Taimur repeats the request, but his words are unclear, leading to speculation about whether he used inappropriate language. The video has ignited a debate on social media. Some users defend Taimur, arguing that he was merely repeating what the adults around him were saying and that children should not be subjected to constant media scrutiny. Others criticize his behavior, attributing it to his upbringing and alleging that he is being spoiled. Many comments target Kareena Kapoor Khan's parenting, suggesting that she hasn't instilled proper values in her son. They argue that she should have corrected his behavior and that he wouldn't have spoken that way if he had been disciplined. The video has garnered over 500,000 likes and numerous comments, highlighting the ongoing debate surrounding celebrity children, privacy, and the role of paparazzi culture in India. Taimur, born on December 20, 2016, is Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan's first child. He has a younger brother, Jehangir Ali Khan.",

    "text": "YASMIN RADJY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SWING LEFT: Despite 91 felony charges and increasingly unhinged rhetoric and behavior, Donald Trump is cruising to the GOP nomination on a wave of MAGA extremism. The news is bleak. Our inboxes are filled with panicked messages several times a day, urging us to donate $5 by midnight or the world might end. Every day I hear the same things from friends, family members, and neighbors alike. Following 2016, they were inspired to donate whatever time and money they could to defeat Trump and his MAGA allies. But now they’re tired. Their #resistance mugs and t-shirts have moved to storage. The only action they take regularly is unsubscribing from the million mailing lists they don’t remember joining, the ones that clog their inboxes and treat them like ATMs. Worst of all, feeling the daily political headwinds, they’ve lost confidence that their actions can actually make a difference. Every day, I tell them all the same thing: We’ve seen this all before. There’s reason to be hopeful. We shouldn’t panic. We know how to win. I run an organization called Swing Left, founded in the aftermath of Trump's election with a simple mission: Give people the tools to direct their time and money to the highest-impact races to win Democratic majorities, both to protect our democracy in the short-term and strengthen into the future. When we launched the day before Trump’s inauguration, Swing Left’s model of turning anxiety into action met the moment. Hundreds of thousands of Americans signed up, eager to learn more about their nearest swing district, roll up their sleeves, and get to work to win back the House. And boy did the Swing Left community get to work. We knocked doors. We made calls. We wrote letters. We donated to candidates. And as we stopped doomscrolling and started mobilizing, we felt ourselves transform from observers to activists with a solid plan. It worked: we won. Not just the House in 2018, but the federal trifecta in 2020 along with key state legislatures. And then again in 2022 holding the Senate, against all odds. And even again in 2023 with reproductive freedom on the ballot in blue and red states alike. But if there’s one thing we’ve learned from seven years of victories, it’s that our commitment can’t waver. Democracy isn’t inevitable. Civic engagement, like any healthy practice, must be renewed, year after year. So this year, even if you have only half an hour a week or $50 to spare, Swing Left can help you turn that time and money into impact. If you choose to work with us, you’ll be joining a core of volunteers recommitted to the fight. Our 550 volunteer groups around the country have been organizing year-round to make possible the wins we’ve experienced year after year. What sustains them is no mystery: They take breaks from the news to actually talk to voters – door to door, call by call, letter by letter – and spend hard-earned donations on the races that matter. In 2024 we have two clear goals: Win the federal trifecta (White House, Senate, and House) and make advances in key state legislatures. The path is clear: Democrats have to win top races in 12 Super States. This includes perennial presidential battlegrounds like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Arizona. But that’s not enough: To win a Senate majority, we need to win in red-leaning states like Montana and Ohio. And to win a House majority, we need to flip seats in often-overlooked blue states like New York and California. Whether you live in a Super State or not, you can make a difference by strategically donating to competitive candidates—via our easy-to-use National Impact Fund— or volunteering with one of our 550 groups around the country. We’re not going to lie: This November’s elections are the toughest test yet. Despite repeated rejections by voters at the ballot box in recent years, Republicans can’t seem to quit right-wing MAGA extremism. Their Trump attachment has not only endured; it has embedded itself into the DNA of the Republican party. No matter which candidate ends up being the eventual GOP nominee, the party continues to pose an existential threat to our rights and freedoms. To preserve our democracy this year and for years to come, we need to replicate the tremendous grassroots energy and activism we saw in 2018 and 2020. Indeed, the lessons learned from those initial post-2016 years can guide us again in 2024. Many of us are understandably exhausted by politics and increasingly desensitized to existential threats. But we need to remember what’s possible when we organize, reengage, stick to the numbers, and commit to taking meaningful action with a solid plan. Join us.",

Per questo 15 ragazzi del paese, tutti italiani e minorenni, sono finiti nei guai. I carabinieri, insieme alla polizia locale, hanno individuato tutti i responsabili attraverso le immagini delle telecamere di videosorveglianza e li ha convocati in caserma insieme ai genitori.\nPer ora non sono stati denunciati ma sono stati messi di fronte ai filmati che li incastrano e redarguiti dai militari oltre che da mamme e papà. Ora sarà il parroco Giambattista Piacentini a decidere cosa fare nelle prossime ore, dopo che aveva presentato denuncia contro ignoti.\nLe immagini delle telecamere ritraggono il gruppo che raggiunge il presepe allestito sotto i portici di piazza Roma, uno che si avvicina alla capanna e prende la statuetta di Gesù e poi la statuetta che passa di mano in mano, lanciata come fosse un pallone, fino a cadere e a frantumarsi. Dopodiché, tutti fuggono via di corsa.",
