    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Dec. 29 (Xinhua) -- Analysts have foreseen better crude palm oil (CPO) prices in 2024, as El Nino weather is expected to affect palm oil supply.\nRHB Investment Bank, the largest investment bank by asset size in Malaysia, said in its recent report that it expects CPO prices to trade higher - crossing the 4,000 ringgit (872 U.S. dollars) per ton mark - as supply should be somewhat affected by El Nino as well as the impact of lower fertilization activities in 2021 to 2022.\nUOBKayHian, one of Asia's largest brokerage firms headquartered in Singapore, also expects CPO prices to trade higher in 2024 with an average price of 4,200 ringgit per ton, following the average of 3,850 ringgit per ton recorded year to date in 2023.\nThe higher price expectation is also underpinned by potentially lower palm oil production, a challenging outlook for global vegetable oil supply and higher palm oil demand.\nAffin Hwang Investment Bank, one of Malaysia's leading bank-backed investment banking groups, also expects CPO prices to trend higher in 2024, attributable to the El Nino phenomenon that is expected to have an impact on the global supply of edible oils and their prices.\nThe research house's CPO price assumption for 2024 is 4,200 ringgit to 4,400 ringgit per ton.\nAffin Hwang also expects Malaysia's plantation sector earnings to jump 24 percent year-on-year in 2024 from a low base in 2023 due mainly to higher CPO price expectations while Malaysia production could be flattish year-on-year.

    "text": "Solana’s Price Decline Deepens Despite Improved Network Participation 2 mins By Aaryamann Shrivastava 10 January 2025, 08:00 GMT+0000 Updated by Harsh Notariya 10 January 2025, 07:03 GMT+0000 Join our Trading Community on Telegram Share on Twitter Share on Email Share on Linkedin Share on Google News In Brief Solana’s price drops to $188 as weak inflows limit recovery despite rising investor activity and network participation. Active addresses grew by 1.5 million in 9 days, signaling optimism, but tangible support remains absent to drive price action. Breaching $201 resistance could spark recovery, while failure at $186 support risks a further drop to $175. promo\nSolana price action has seen a significant drawdown over the past three days, falling from $221 to $201.\nDespite this decline, investor sentiment remains bullish, although their optimism has not yet translated into tangible actions to support a recovery.\nSolana Needs More Support The number of active addresses on the Solana network has been steadily increasing since the beginning of the year. Over nine days, addresses conducting transactions on the network grew by 1.5 million. This rise indicates that investors are optimistic about Solana’s potential for a bounce-back and are positioning themselves to capitalize on lower prices.\nWhile the rising number of active addresses highlights a growing interest, it also emphasizes a gap between optimism and action. Many investors are still waiting for more favorable conditions before significantly increasing their participation in the network, leaving Solana in a precarious position.\nSponsored Sponsored Solana Active Addresses. Source: Glassnode The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator shows that inflows into Solana are not yet strong enough to drive substantial recovery. While investors remain optimistic, the lack of materialized inflows has limited Solana’s ability to benefit from heightened interest and rising active addresses.\nThe weak inflows underline the need for investors to make a more concerted effort to support Solana’s price action. Until these inflows strengthen, the altcoin’s bullish potential will remain unrealized, leaving it vulnerable to broader market influences and continued volatility .\nSolana CMF. Source: TradingView SOL Price Prediction: Breaching Resistance At the time of writing, Solana’s price stands at $188 after reclaiming the critical support level of $186. The altcoin is now targeting the $201 resistance level, aiming to convert it into support to set the stage for a potential recovery.\nIf inflows into Solana gain momentum, bullish activity could push the altcoin past the $201 resistance. Breaching this level would enable further recovery, likely attracting more investors and reinforcing the positive sentiment.\nSolana Price Analysis. Source: TradingView However, a failure to sustain the current support could lead to a deeper decline, with Solana potentially falling to $175. Such a move would invalidate the bullish recovery thesis and may exacerbate negative sentiment among investors.\nBest crypto platforms in Europe | January 2025 eToro Explore Coinrule Explore Uphold Explore Coinbase Explore Chain GPT Explore Best crypto platforms in Europe | January 2025 eToro Explore Coinrule Explore Uphold Explore Coinbase Explore Chain GPT Explore Best crypto platforms in Europe | January 2025 eToro Coinrule Uphold Coinbase Chain GPT Disclaimer\nIn line with the Trust Project guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.

    "title": "Cette petite plage d'Europe possède une eau magique - on s'y baigne dans deux substances aux effets bien connus",
    "text": "Vous souhaitez profiter d'un spa gratuit ? Il existe un lieu où trois plages sont bordées de sable blanc, où les eaux sont laiteuses et surtout… dotées de propriétés thérapeutiques ! Outre le cadre idyllique de cet endroit, des eaux sulfureuses coulent et sont gorgées de minéraux qui peuvent vous guérir. On y trouve du soufre et du collagène qui proviennent de grottes situées tout près, ce qui vous permettra certainement de soulager vos rhumatismes, vos courbatures ou votre arthrite. Des eaux avec des propriétés antioxydantes, anti-inflammatoires et antiseptiques. L'expérience est à la fois relaxante et vivifiante et convaincra les plus sceptiques d'entre nous ! \"La veille de ma visite, je m'étais blessée en randonnée (...) Je boitais, mais après 30 minutes à nager dans l'eau, ma douleur avait totalement disparu\", a notamment témoigné une touriste venue d'Australie, sur TripAdvisor. La température de l'eau avoisine les 20 degrés même en plein été. Assez frais, mais revigorant ! Petit bonus : un câble avec pédalier permet de faire descendre de la nourriture depuis le petit restaurant le long de la route, livrée dans un panier, directement sur la plage ! Malgré tout, ces plages sont plutôt petites et assez prisées des touristes. Il n'est donc pas idéal de s'y rendre en plein mois d'août… ou alors, il faut tâcher d'arriver tôt ! Autre recommandation : il est conseillé de se munir de chaussures d'eau, puisque la plage et le bord de mer sont jonchés de cailloux qui peuvent rendre la marche un peu plus ardue. Pour accéder aux plages, il est recommandé de louer une voiture ou de s'y rendre dans le cadre d'une excursion touristique. Il vous suffira ensuite de descendre un escalier pour atteindre la mer et les eaux gorgées de bienfaits. Mais où se situe donc ce petit coin de paradis ? C'est sur l'île de Zakynthos, en Grèce, que vous pouvez découvrir ce lieu d'exception. Sur la cote nord-est, se trouve Xigia, un complexe de trois plages dans lesquelles les eaux contiennent du soufre et du collagène. La plus célèbre des trois est située au nord, tout près d'un domaine viticole, mais il vous est également possible de visiter les deux autres, bien qu'elles soient nettement moins riches en soufre.",

    "text": "[The attempted coup on Wednesday (26) in Bolivia](https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2024/06/26/presidente-arce-denuncia-mobilizacoes-irregulares-do-exercito-na-bolivia-e-evo-fala-em-golpe-de-estado) made the world look at this Latin American country with attention. Part of the country's armed forces gathered in front of the Palacio de Gobierno, the Bolivian government’s headquarters, in defiance of President Luis Arce. The situation calmed down after the change of command at the top of the Bolivian Armed Forces. With a population of just over 12 million people and a GDP of US$46 billion, the country is home to around 23% of the world's lithium reserves, a key mineral for the tech industry. [The metal could be behind intentions to destabilize the country](http://www.brasildefato.com.br/2024/06/22/litio-boliviano-e-alvo-dos-estados-unidos-mas-estatizacao-garante-controle-do-governo). It was about Bolivia that tech tycoon Elon Musk referred to in a Twitter post in 2020 saying that “ [We will coup whoever we want!](https://x.com/panoparker/status/1318157559266762752)”. Today, [the country has little capacity to process the metal](https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2023/02/19/plano-de-industrializacao-do-litio-boliviano-e-retomado-em-parceria-com-chinahttps://www.brasildefato.com.br/2023/02/19/plano-de-industrializacao-do-litio-boliviano-e-retomado-em-parceria-com-china), but partnerships signed with China in 2023 could change this situation. Marco Fernandes, who holds a master's degree in History, co-founded Dongsheng and edits Wenhua Zongheng International magazine, explains that the agreements \"open up a new horizon for the Bolivian economy.” \"In January, an initial investment of US$1 billion was announced by global lithium battery leader China's CATL in a joint venture with Bolivia's state-owned company Yacimientos de Litio Boliviano (YLB, in Spanish) to build two factories that are expected to produce 50,000 tons of lithium carbonate per year. The total investment could reach US$9.9 billion,\" Fernandes says. \"In June, YLB signed two other agreements, reaching US$1.4 billion: one with China's Citic Guoan Group and the other with Russia's Uranium One Group (a subsidiary of state nuclear giant Rosatom). There will be two more lithium carbonate production plants, which may reach 45,000 tons a year,\" he says. Fernandes recalls that Bolivia produced only 635.5 tons of lithium carbonate between January and November 2022. \"With these new agreements, [lithium carbonate] production could reach almost 100,000 tons by 2025.\" In addition, Citig Guoan is thinking about investing in the production of lithium batteries and electric vehicles in Bolivia. \"In other words, Bolivia is moving towards a new phase of its national lithium production, accelerating the industrialization process, taking a greater share of the mineral's wealth (instead of just exporting raw lithium), advancing in the training of technical staff, and doing all this in partnership with China and Russia.\" Edited by: Lucas Estanislau",

    "text": "CAIRO: A series of tentative agreements between key Libyan officials have raised hopes of a resolution to the country’s long-running civil conflict.\nArab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit at the league’s headquarters in Cairo on Sunday hosted Mohammed Menfi, president of Libya’s Presidential Council; Aguila Saleh, speaker of the house of representatives; and Mohammed Takala, president of the High State Council.\nThe talks aimed to facilitate intra-Libyan dialogue as part of the Arab League’s efforts to foster mutual understanding among Libyan parties.\nA league statement referred to efforts to bridge viewpoints and resolve differences regarding presidential and parliamentary elections in Libya.\nThe three Libyan officials agreed to promote the country’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and reject any hostile external interference in its political process.\nA technical committee will be established, and will meet within a designated time frame to review and suggest appropriate amendments to joint action.\nThis will expand the basis of consensus and acceptance of the work accomplished by the 6+6 Joint Committee.\nThe technical committee will also aim to resolve any disagreements among the Libyan parties regarding existing legislation.\nIn the meeting, the parties agreed to establish a single government body responsible for overseeing Libya’s electoral process and delivering essential services to citizens.\nAs part of the consensus-building efforts, the three parties also agreed to call on the UN Support Mission in Libya and the international community for assistance.\nA second round of talks will be held to finalize the agreements.\nThe Libyan parties praised the Arab League for bringing opposing points of view together in a bid to restore the country’s electoral process.\nDuring a press conference, Menfi said: “We support any consensus between the political parties to conduct the electoral process.”\nThe results of the meeting “lived up to Libyan’s ambitions to hold elections,” he added.\n“We agreed to form a technical committee to solve some of the problems, and a meeting will be held soon to complete the steps,” Menfi said.\n“We stressed that elections are a way to reach a stable state.”",

    "text": "Guy Fieri Foundation donates $1.2M to Lahaina restaurant workers impacted by wildfires Celebrated chef and TV personality Guy Fieri teamed up with the [Hawaiʻi Restaurant Association](https://hawaiirestaurant.org/), [American Savings Bank](https://www.asbhawaii.com/) and [Fiserv](https://www.fiserv.com/en.html), Inc., to distribute $600 prepaid debit cards to Lahaina restaurant workers who lost their job when their workplace was destroyed in the tragic wildfires on Aug. 8. With many residents still struggling to purchase everyday essentials, such as food and medication, this gift provides much-needed assistance to Lahaina restaurant workers who have lost so much. The HRA has spent the last few weeks reaching out to affected Lahaina restaurant owners whose businesses were destroyed by the fire. So far, HRA has been in contact with about 70 restaurant owners, who are scheduled to pick up the cards for their employees at ASB’s Kahului Branch through the end of the week. Lahaina restaurant owners who have not yet been in contact with the HRA should email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or call 808-944-9105 for more information on the prepaid debit card program and next steps. Restaurant owners must contact the HRA before picking up their employees’ cards. As a chef and foodie, Fieri has established a special connection with Maui and has showcased many of the island’s restaurants on his various television shows. Fieri has dedicated his life to supporting the culinary industry, and when he heard about the devastation from the fires on Maui restaurant workers, he sprang into action. Fieri organized “ [Chefs for Maui](https://guyfierifoundation.ejoinme.org/chefsformaui),” a dinner in Sonoma, California, which drew support from 38 award-winning chefs, celebrity friends, foodies and world-renowned restauranteurs. The sold-out event raised over $1.5 million, which was donated to the HRA and Salvation Army Hawaiʻi. A portion of those proceeds went toward purchasing these prepaid debit cards for Maui restaurant workers. “Hawaiʻi Restaurant Association is pleased to partner with the Guy Fieri Foundation, American Savings Bank and Fiserv to provide this support to workers employed at the restaurants destroyed in the Lahaina wildfires,” said Sheryl Matsuoka, executive director at HRA. “As we worked over the last several months to contact those affected, we heard many stories of heartbreak, tragedy and loss. Yet, we also heard stories of hope and resilience.” “We are honored to collaborate with the Guy Fieri Foundation, as well as American Savings Bank and Fiserv, in this meaningful endeavor to, once again, support our foodservice community,” said Matsuoka. To ensure donations from the Guy Fieri Foundation directly benefit impacted restaurant workers, ASB and Fiserv waived all fees related to the production, distribution and management of the cards. “American Savings Bank is committed to supporting the individuals, families and businesses on Maui as the community heals and rebuilds in the aftermath of the devastating wildfires,” said Ann Teranishi, president and CEO at American Savings Bank. “We hope the generosity demonstrated by the Guy Fieri Foundation will inspire others to join in and support the Maui community.” “We’re proud to help bring to life initiatives that benefit small businesses, their workers, and the communities they serve,” said Jose Garcia, senior vice president at Fiserv. “The need for everyday essentials never stops, and with a fee-free prepaid card, people will have a convenient way to access these donations to make day-to-day purchases.” Sponsored Content Comments [View Comments](#)",
