    "title": "Some were lured into Christianity, some left Islam saying ‘it’s a baby-making factory’: Read about the 50 cases of Ghar Wapsi that OpIndia covered in 2023",
    "text": "As the year draws to a close, it’s important to reflect on a significant yet often overlooked issue affecting vulnerable segments of the Hindu community. Across various regions in India, there has been a troubling emergence of conversion rackets. These rackets are frequently linked to foreign entities, Islamic groups, and influential Christian missionary organisations. They target economically disadvantaged Hindus and tribal communities, exploiting their vulnerability with offers of monetary assistance, food, clothing, education, healthcare services, and other material benefits. In their desperate attempts to escape poverty, many individuals are swayed by these offers and convert to either Islam or Christianity. However, they soon realise that the relief provided is only temporary and does little to alter their fundamental hardships. They then undergo Ghar Wapsi.\nDespite the widespread nature of this issue, only a fraction of these cases gain public attention. This typically happens when vulnerable Hindus who have been misled are rescued, or when individuals, recognise the deceit they were subjected to, and decide to return to their Hindu faith through ‘Ghar Wapsi’.\nThis article aims to compile and highlight the numerous instances from this year where Hindu families or individuals, coerced into converting to either Islam or Christianity, chose to embrace their Hindu heritage once more. These stories not only shed light on the deceptive tactics used by evangelists and Islamists, who initially entice with financial and material aid but later resort to indoctrination but also underscore the resilience and enduring faith of those who choose to return to Hindu i sm .\n1. Ghar Wapsi in Etah In Uttar Pradesh’s Etah district, 35 individuals from 10 Christian families re-embraced to Sanatan Dharma. This event took place in the Jaranikalan village in the Shakrauli area, where these families had converted to Christianity in 1995, reportedly due to enticements. The Hindu Ekta Group interacted with these families and discovered that many were keen to return to Hinduism.\nConsequently, on 2nd January 2023, a special program was organised at the Pathwari Mata Temple in the village, where these 35 individuals participated in a havan ritual and embraced Sanatan Dharma. According to Shubham, founder of the Hindu Ekta Group, these families were lured and misled into converting to Christianity in 1995 and have been following Christian practices since then. However, several expressed a voluntary desire to revert to Sanatan Dharma and did the Ghar Wapsi.\n2. Another Ghar Wapsi in Etah In another incident, Shabnam from Etah district in Uttar Pradesh converted to Hinduism and changed her name to Neha Pathak on 16th January 2023. She married a Hindu man named Komesh Pathak, and for this, she sought the help of the High Court and district administration. Initially, both families were opposed to their marriage. Shabnam, who is a graduate and originally from Ghazipur, was living in Manesar, Haryana, with her elder sister. Komesh Pathak also resided there, working in a medical company. The couple met in Manesar, and over time, they fell in love.\nShabnam was already loving Hinduism, especially the festival of Diwali. After their marriage, she decided to formally adopt Hinduism and submitted a petition to the Allahabad High Court and the District Magistrate. The District Magistrate of Etah issued a notice inviting objections for 21 days. Upon receiving no objections during this period, the district administration issued her a certificate confirming her conversion to Hinduism.\n3. Mega Ghar Wapsi in Chhattisgarh by Prabal Pratap Judev In the Mahasamund district of Chhattisgarh, during the Shrimad Bhagwat Katha event held in Basna, approximately 1100 Christians belonging to about 325 families returned to Hinduism on 19th January 2023. BJP leader Prabal Pratap Singh Judev facilitated their Ghar Wapsi (return to Hinduism) by ritually cleansing their feet with the holy water of the Ganga.\nThose who underwent Ghar Wapsi expressed that they had gone away from their Dharma and converted to another religion, but after realising their mistake, they decided to come back to Hinduism. Pandit Himanshu Krishna Maharaj administered to these individuals an oath of loyalty to the Sanatan Dharma. Prabal Pratap Singh Judeo, a BJP leader from Chhattisgarh, continues to campaign for the return of converted individuals to their original faith.\n4. There can be no religion better than Hinduism – Sultana Begum On Friday, January 21, 2023, in a program of Bageshwar Dham Divya Darbar, a Muslim woman named Sultana Begum adopted Hinduism in the presence of Mahant Pandit Dhirendra Krishna Shastri. Sultana, hailing from Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, shared her story, saying, “My name is Sultana. My father’s name is Amir Khan and my mother is Sarwari Begum. I practised idol worship, which led to my family disowning me. They say that I am a disgrace to the Muslim community and that I will go to hell when I die.”\n#BREAKING | बागेश्वर दरबार में धीरेंद्र शास्त्री ने कुछ लोगों को हिंदू धर्म में वापसी करवाई\nदेखते रहिए रिपब्लिक भारत #LIVE : https://t.co/h34cjWzjtJ pic.twitter.com/bppHrEyNts\n— रिपब्लिक भारत (@Republic_Bharat) January 21, 2023 She further expressed, “I firmly believe that there can be no religion better than Hinduism. It’s a religion of civilization and values. In Hinduism, there are no marriages between siblings, and women’s lives are not destroyed. Practices like triple talaq do not exist. Here, marriage happens once with the sacred seven rounds around the holy fire, emphasising the significance of sindoor (vermilion), mangal sutra (sacred necklace), and the complete sixteen adornments for a married woman. I also worship Lord Krishna in the form of Laddu Gopal.”\n5. Salim Khan became Sukhram Das in Morena of Madhya Pradesh Salim Khan, a resident of the Ambah region in the Morena district of Madhya Pradesh, embraced Hinduism on 22nd January 2023, adopting the name Baba Sukhram Das.

His guru initiated him and gave him the new name, Sukhram Das.

    "text": "Il 2024 è stato confermato dal Servizio per il Cambiamento Climatico di Copernicus ( Copernicus Climate Change Service - C3S ) come l'anno più caldo mai registrato a livello globale e il primo anno solare in cui la temperatura media globale ha superato di 1.5°C il livello preindustriale.\nL' andamento delle temperature mensili fornisce un indizio cruciale per comprendere alcuni dei fattori che hanno portato il 2024 a diventare l'anno più caldo mai registrato. La prima metà dell'anno è stata particolarmente calda: ogni mese ha registrato temperature globali più elevate rispetto allo stesso mese dell'anno precedente. Ciò ha contribuito a una striscia di 13 mesi di temperature mensili da record, che si è conclusa a giugno. Da luglio in poi, le anomalie della temperatura globale sono rimaste significativamente al di sopra della media. L' agosto 2024 è stato caldo come l'agosto 2023, e gli altri mesi da luglio a dicembre si sono classificati come i secondi più caldi della storia, dopo il 2023. In particolare, il 22 luglio ha segnato il giorno più caldo mai registrato, con una temperatura globale di 17.16° C , secondo l'ERA5. La persistenza di temperature medie mensili globali eccezionalmente elevate nella prima metà del 2024 ha reso probabile, a partire dalla fine dell'estate, il superamento del 2023 come anno più caldo mai registrato.\nInoltre , il 2024 è stato il primo anno a registrare un'anomalia di temperatura annuale superiore alla soglia di 1.5°C rispetto al livello preindustriale . Anche la media del biennio 2023-2024 supera questa soglia. Sebbene questo non significhi che abbiamo superato il limite fissato dall'Accordo di Parigi - che si riferisce alle anomalie di temperatura mediate su almeno 20 anni - sottolinea che le temperature globali stanno aumentando al di là di quanto l'uomo moderno abbia mai sperimentato.\nAumento della temperatura superficiale globale dell'aria del periodo di riferimento preindustriale 1850-1900, sulla base di diversi dataset di temperature globali mostrati come medie annuali dal 1967 (a sinistra) e come medie quinquennali dal 1850 (a destra). Credit: C3S / ECMWF\nIl C3S è implementato per conto della Commissione europea dal Centro europeo per le previsioni meteorologiche a medio raggio ( ECMWF ), i cui scienziati hanno monitorato i principali indicatori climatici e documentato record di temperatura giornalieri, mensili e annuali senza precedenti per il 2024. Il cambiamento climatico indotto dall'uomo rimane il principale responsabile delle temperature estreme della superficie dell'aria e del mare; anche altri fattori, come l'Oscillazione Meridionale El Niño (ENSO), hanno contribuito alle temperature insolite osservate durante l'anno . Quest'anno le seguenti organizzazioni coinvolte nel monitoraggio del clima globale - ECMWF, NASA, NOAA, UK Met Office, Berkeley Earth e l'Organizzazione Meteorologica Mondiale (WMO) - hanno compiuto uno sforzo congiunto per coordinare il rilascio dei loro dati, evidenziando le condizioni eccezionali sperimentate nel 2024.\n“Tutti i dati sulla temperatura globale prodotti a livello internazionale mostrano che il 2024 è stato l'anno più caldo dall'inizio delle registrazioni nel 1850. – spiega Carlo Buontempo , direttore del Copernicus Climate Change Service, ECMWF – L'umanità è responsabile del proprio destino, ma il modo in cui rispondiamo alla sfida climatica deve basarsi sull'evidenza. Il futuro è nelle nostre mani: un'azione rapida e decisa può ancora modificare la traiettoria del nostro clima futuro”.\n(Fonte: ERA5. Credit: C3S/ECMWF)\nPer Samantha Burgess , Strategic Lead for Climate, ECMWF “ogni anno dell'ultimo decennio è uno dei dieci più caldi mai registrati. Siamo ormai sull'orlo per superare il livello di 1.5ºC definito nell'Accordo di Parigi e la media degli ultimi due anni è già al di sopra di questo livello. Queste alte temperature globali, unite ai livelli record di vapore acqueo atmosferico nel 2024, hanno comportato ondate di calore e forti precipitazioni senza precedenti, causando sofferenza a milioni di persone.”\nAnomalie ed estremi della temperatura superficiale del mare per il 2024. Le categorie di colore si riferiscono ai percentili delle distribuzioni di temperatura per il periodo di riferimento 1991-2020. Le categorie estreme (“più freddo” e “più caldo”) si basano sulle classifiche per il periodo 1979-2024. I valori sono calcolati solo per gli oceani privi di ghiaccio. (Fonte: ERA5. Credit: C3S / ECMWF)\nTemperature superficiali marine (SST) elevate in tutto l'oceano mondiale Le alte temperature superficiali marine (SST) sono state uno dei fattori più significativi alla base della prevalenza di alte temperature globali nel 2023 e 2024. Uno dei fattori alla base di queste elevate SST è stata l'evoluzione dell'Oscillazione Meridionale El Niño (ENSO). Questo ENSO ha raggiunto il suo picco nel dicembre 2023 e ha continuato a influenzare le temperature globali nella prima metà del 2024.\nAnche se l'evento El Niño è terminato e la transizione verso condizioni più neutre nel Pacifico orientale equatoriale è avvenuta, molte regioni hanno continuato a sperimentare SST insolitamente elevate, con il risultato che la SST globale è rimasta più alta della media. Nel 2024, la media annuale delle SST nell'oceano extrapolare ha raggiunto un livello record.\nLo studio Clima, i dieci eventi estremi più devastanti e costosi del 2024 di Pasquale Raicaldo 30 Dicembre 2024\nLe condizioni climatiche possono influenzare gli eventi meteorologici estremi Nel 2024 sono stati osservati in tutto il mondo eventi meteorologici estremi, che vanno da forti tempeste e inondazioni a ondate di calore, siccità e incendi. L'aumento della frequenza e dell'intensità di questi eventi rappresenta un rischio significativo per il sostentamento delle persone in tutto il mondo. La quantità totale di vapore acqueo nell'atmosfera ha raggiunto un livello record nel 2024, circa il 5% in più rispetto alla media del periodo compreso tra il 1991 e il 2020, un valore significativamente più alto rispetto al 2023. Questa abbondante disponibilità di umidità ha amplificato il potenziale di eventi piovosi estremi . Inoltre, insieme alle elevate temperature della superficie del mare, ha contribuito allo sviluppo di grandi tempeste , tra cui i cicloni tropicali .\nCrisi climatica: i 10 eventi meteorologici estremi più mortali dell'ultimo decennio\nLe temperature elevate possono portare a situazioni in cui il corpo è sottoposto a stress da surriscaldamento . Oltre alla temperatura, anche altri fattori ambientali come l'umidità possono influire sullo stress da calore. Nel 2024, in gran parte del mondo si sono registrati più giorni della media con almeno “forte stress da caldo” . Alcune regioni hanno anche registrato più giorni della media con “stress da caldo estremo” , livello al quale è indispensabile intervenire per evitare un colpo di calore.\nLo studio Siccità, esondazioni, alluvioni: in Italia oltre 350 eventi estremi nel 2024 di Luca Fraioli 30 Dicembre 2024\nI prolungati periodi di siccità in diverse regioni hanno creato condizioni favorevoli agli incendi boschivi . In tutte le Americhe sono stati registrati incendi su larga scala e persistenti. In termini di emissioni di carbonio da incendi, la Bolivia e il Venezuela hanno registrato i livelli più alti mai registrati, mentre il Canada ha registrato il secondo livello più alto, in base ai dati del Servizio di monitoraggio dell'Atmosfera di Copernicus (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service - CAMS).\nScienza Dal clima alle pandemie, cosa ci aspetta nel 2025 secondo “Science” di Giacomo Talignani 04 Gennaio 2025\nGhiaccio marino nell'Artico e nell'Antartico L'estensione del ghiaccio marino nell'Artico e intorno all'Antartide è un indicatore essenziale della stabilità del clima terrestre , monitorato dal C3S. Nel 2024, l'estensione del ghiaccio marino in queste regioni è stata significativamente inferiore alla media.\nL'estensione del ghiaccio marino antartico ha raggiunto valori record o quasi record per il secondo anno consecutivo. Da giugno a ottobre, l'estensione mensile è stata la seconda più bassa dopo il 2023 e la più bassa a novembre, per i rispettivi mesi. Al minimo annuale di febbraio, l'estensione mensile si è classificata al terzo posto tra i valori più bassi registrati dal satellite. Nell'Artico, l'estensione del ghiaccio marino è stata vicina alla media del periodo tra il 1991 e il 2020 fino a luglio, ma è scesa ben al di sotto della media nei mesi successivi. Al suo minimo annuale a settembre, l'estensione mensile si è classificata al quinto posto tra le più basse registrate dal satellite.\nGas a effetto serra in costante aumento Il fattore determinante nell'evoluzione di molti indicatori climatici chiave nel 2024 è stato l'aumento della temperatura globale, che è in gran parte associato alla crescente concentrazione di gas serra (GHG) nell'atmosfera, conseguenza delle attività umane. Il monitoraggio dei gas serra fornisce informazioni a sostegno dell'attuazione delle politiche di mitigazione. Il tasso di aumento dell'anidride carbonica è stato superiore a quello osservato negli ultimi anni. Il tasso di aumento del metano è stato significativamente inferiore a quello degli ultimi tre anni.\nConcentrazione atmosferica globale mensile di CO2 (a sinistra) e CH4 (a destra) mediata in colonna, derivata dai dati satellitari per il periodo 2003-2024 (linea tratteggiata) e media su 12 mesi (linea continua).

Intervallo spaziale: 60ºS - 60ºN sulla terraferma (Credit: C3S / CAMS / ECMWF / Università di Brema / SRON)\nLaurence Rouil , direttore del CAMS di ECMWF, conclude: “Questo rapporto dimostra il valore critico delle nostre attività di monitoraggio. Nel 2024, i gas serra atmosferici hanno raggiunto i livelli annuali più alti mai registrati nell'atmosfera, secondo i dati C3S e CAMS. Le concentrazioni di anidride carbonica nel 2024 erano superiori di 2.9 ppm rispetto al 2023 e quelle di metano di 3 ppb. Questo aumento ha portato la stima annuale della concentrazione atmosferica di anidride carbonica a 422 ppm e di metano a 1897 ppb . I nostri dati indicano chiaramente un costante aumento globale delle emissioni di gas serra, che rimangono il principale agente del cambiamento climatico ”.\nArgomenti news clima riscaldamento globale emissioni ghiacciai",

    "text": " In 2023, on the back of the rapidly changing world around us, organisations recognised the power of staying agile and nimble to respond to the ever-evolving talent needs, and this was demonstrated across all facets -- mindset, skillsets and toolsets.\nIn this year of tremendous change in the financial services sector, HR needed to strengthen the core by being strategic consultants to leaders for creating future-ready organisations. The spotlight shifted even more towards building a robust tech talent pool while investing in initiatives to upskill the current workforce. Organisations focused on leveraging AI’s transformative capabilities to drive innovation, operational efficiency, and a competitive edge.\nThe emphasis on diversity and inclusion became integral to talent acquisition, employee engagement, and overall business strategy. Wellness was another key trend that continued to resonate across the industry. And last but not least, ‘working patterns’ were top conversations in the industry with many organisations encouraging employees to return to the office.\nI expect 2024 to be a transformative year where humans and technologies will blend seamlessly and adapt to each other’s ways of working to ultimately elevate experiences, effectiveness and business results in organisations.\nAt Fidelity International, we are poised to ensure our talent is set up for the future. For example, we will continue to leverage our ‘Talent Marketplace’ that helps us as an organization map our peoples’ skills, understand the skill themes and create programmes tailored for the future. We also expect to take bold steps to integrate Gen AI into how we operate, bringing in operational efficiencies and applying its power to use cases. We have a strong and mature diversity and inclusion programme across gender, LGBTQ+, disabilities, cultural and social mobility, and we will continue our journey of further evolving and deeply embedding this programme. We embraced hybrid working and the power it gives our people to work better and more efficiently and 2024 will be about working through the nuances of hybrid working. Holistic wellness has been and will be a key theme in the future as well. There is something unique and distinctive about working with Fidelity International; we call this #FeelFidelity; we will further embed this culture across our locations.",

    "title": "Travis County DA wants to overturn Abbott’s pardon of convicted murderer | Texas | news-journal.com",
    "text": "Travis County District Attorney José Garza announced Tuesday that his office would ask the state’s highest criminal court to overturn Gov. Greg Abbott’s pardon of a man who was convicted of killing a Black Lives Matter demonstrator in 2020. One day after a Travis County jury convicted Daniel Perry of murder in April 2023 for shooting Garrett Foster, Abbott asked the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles to consider the case. Last month, the board unanimously recommended Abbott pardon Perry’s 25-year prison sentence, which he did the same day. In July 2020, Perry had turned into a crowd of marching protesters while driving for a ride-share company in downtown Austin. Foster, who was participating in a protest against police brutality, was legally carrying an AK-47 at the time. Perry claims Foster had raised his rifle toward him, though witnesses said he didn’t. Perry fired a handgun repeatedly at Foster before he sped away and called police. On Tuesday, Garza said his office filed a petition with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to overturn Abbott’s pardon, arguing the governor’s intervention interfered with lower court rulings and halted the appellate process. The Travis County prosecutor also said Perry’s case did not meet the requirements to receive a pardon. “When Governor Abbott issued the pardon, not only did he circumnavigate the process for pardons, he exceeded his authority and violated the separation of powers doctrine,” Holly Taylor, the director of the Division of Public Integrity and Complex Crimes for the district attorney’s office, said during a press briefing on Tuesday. Garza said he also requested an opportunity to argue the case in front of the court to “make our case on behalf of our democracy, our legal system and the family.” In his declaration announcing the pardon last month, Abbott claimed Garza, who ran for district attorney on a progressive platform, had prioritized “reducing access to guns” instead of protecting Perry’s right to self defense. The governor’s office did not return a request for comment as of Tuesday evening. Sheila Foster, the mother of Foster, who was a U.S. Air Force veteran, was present at Tuesday’s press conference. She said Abbot’s pardon could encourage similar violence against others who have different political views. “My own child was killed on American soil for doing nothing but practicing his First and Second Amendment rights and our governor just said, ‘That’s OK, that’s acceptable,’” Foster said. Doug O’Connell, Perry’s lawyer, called Tuesday’s filing “political theater” by Garza. “The pardon power of the executive branch is a well settled Constitutional authority,” O’Connell said on social media. Abbott rarely issues pardons, in which the seven-person board — appointed by the governor — must recommend before Abbott can act. Abbott granted three pardons in 2023, two pardons in 2022 and eight in 2021 — most for lower-level offenses. Abbott’s pardon of Perry came after influential conservative voices, like former Fox News host Tucker Carlson and former Texas GOP Chair Matt Rinaldi, urged Abbott to pardon Perry saying he acted in self-defense in the face of dangerous protests. Shortly after Perry’s conviction, unsealed court documents revealed that he had made a slew of racist, threatening comments about protesters in text messages and social media posts. Days after George Floyd’s murder by a Minneapolis police officer prompted nationwide protests, Perry sent a text message saying, “I might go to Dallas to shoot looters.” Both Perry and Foster are white. Those court documents also revealed that Perry sent inappropriate messages to someone who claimed to be 16 years old through a messaging platform that has been used to share child pornography. Following Abbott’s pardon, a group of 14 attorneys general from across the country wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice, asking the federal agency to investigate whether Perry violated Foster’s civil rights. “When states fail to protect their residents from such violations of our civil rights, it’s imperative that DOJ steps in and ensures that justice is served,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. “We urge DOJ to investigate this incident and demonstrate that this will not be tolerated in America.”",
