    "text": "A dedicated teenage fundraiser, a police sergeant, councillors and one of the region's MPs are among those who have been recognised in the King's New Year Honours. [Lisa O'Brien](/news/authors/lisa-o'brien/) They join a string of other unsung heroes from across the Black Country and Staffordshire who have been rewarded for their actions. Among them is 17-year-old Louis Johnson, from Tettenhall Wood, Wolverhampton, who has raised over £75,000 for 18 charities. He has been awarded a British Empire Medal (BEM) for services to the community in Wolverhampton. The City of Wolverhampton College student, who is studying uniformed public services and wants to join the police force when he is older, has received numerous awards for his fundraising efforts, which started from the age of two. He has taken on fundraising walks, abseils, bike rides, set up stalls and raffles and even sat in a bath of beans. Charities and good causes that have benefitted have included Birmingham Children's Hospital, Mary Stevens Hospice, the Good Shepherd in Wolverhampton and Compton Care, among many others. Sergeant John Price, of West Midlands Police, who has played a leading role in enhancing digital forensics has been recognised with the King’s Police Medal (KPM). He has been at the forefront of introducing technology improvements to help the police force catch crooks, protect the public and get justice for victims. He joined the force over 20 years ago and has worked in various teams such as neighbourhood policing, CID, tackling acquisitive crime and the counter-terrorism unit before moving into digital forensics in 2016. He has since helped improve ways of working to assist not only policing but other law enforcement agencies. The Mayor of Sandwell, Councillor Bill Gavan, has been appointed an MBE. The Langley Labour councillor has been recognised for his contribution to politics, LGBT issues and helping those in recovery from drink and drug issues. Councillor Gavan, aged 73, has been sober for 47 years and helped countless people since. He was also the founder chairman of Birmingham Pride and ran the popular Birmingham nightclub Subway, navigating the pitfalls of that particular industry in his own indomitable way. A businessman who represents the West Midlands region at a national level has also been appointed an MBE. Phillip George Potter from Bewdley has been given the award for services to business and to the community in Worcestershire. Mr Potter is the regional lead, West Midlands, Wales and South West for UK Export Finance, a government organisation which helps exporters navigate the market and come up with solutions to finance issues and encourage them to achieve sales growth. He has been with the organisation for over 11 years and before that spent over 34 years working at HSBC, starting off in leadership and relationship management positions in the West Midlands before developing and implementing the Midlands Regional approach to the bank's international strategy. Outside of work he has been on the committee of the Bewdley festival for many years. Meanwhile, MP for Wyre Forest Mark Garnier, who was first elected in 2010, has been given an OBE for political and public service. A number of people in Staffordshire have also been recognised with honours. South Staffordshire Council’s leader, Councillor Roger Lees, has been awarded the BEM for his contribution to the district. Leader of the council since 2021, he has been in local government for 32 years, having begun on Swindon Parish Council in 1991, before being elected a district councillor in 2007, and becoming a cabinet member in 2009. He has been involved in a range of community initiatives and sat as a magistrate on the South Staffordshire bench for 22 years. A Staffordshire businessman who has helped turn a 161-year-old manufacturing company into an exporting powerhouse has also been recognised in the New Year Honours. Rowan Crozier, from Lichfield, has been appointed an MBE for services to manufacturing and enterprise, just months after being bestowed an honorary doctorate from Birmingham City University (BCU) for his outstanding contribution to industry and academia. The 48-year-old runs Birmingham-based Brandauer and has implemented an apprentice scheme which has helped local youngsters into the industry. The company also invested in a £1 million Precision Tooling Academy in Aldridge. Rowan also is an export champion with the Department of Trade, as his company sends its precision parts to 26 countries and also is a volunteer at Support Staffordshire. Stoke-on-Trent based Kenneth Paul Newton has 35 years experience in the prison service, many of them in senior roles. He has been credited with 'turning around' Birmingham Prison and has been recognised with an OBE for services to public service. As governing governor at HMP Birmingham, he was credited as bringing a change in fortune in the prison, formerly known as Winson Green. Brought in from Swaleside Jail in Kent in 2018 by Prison Minister Rory Stewart, he oversaw the change of control of Birmingham from G4S to the government once more and was given 28 days to come up with an action plan. It followed a notorious December 2016 riot described as one of the worst in England for 25 years. At the time, inspectors found a jail that had \"all but collapsed\". On a visit this year, five years later, government inspectors were left 'stunned' by the 'significant' improvement and noted a world of difference between the broken windows, piles of rubbish and cramped conditions that had previously been observed. Prisoner behaviour had 'significantly' improved and Mr Newton and his staff was praised for his work in improving 'beyond recognition' the prison.

Previously, he was Senior Vice President of Marketing for HeartFlow, leading all aspects of the marketing and product functions for a new category of personalized, noninvasive testing for heart disease, including its initial product, HeartFlow FFRCT. He has also held senior marketing and sales leadership roles at OptiMedica, NeoGuide Systems and Avantec Vascular. Mr. Eno holds an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a BA, with Honors and Distinction, from Stanford University, where he was Phi Beta Kappa.\nDr. Lance Myers Appointed as Chief AI Scientist\nOn September 24th BEAT announced the appointment of Lance Myers, PhD, a pioneer in digital health data analytics and body-worn biosensor technologies, as Chief Artificial Intelligence (AI) Scientist. In this newly created position, Dr. Myers will play a pivotal role in guiding how AI is applied to the Company’s core technology.\nMost recently, Dr. Myers served as AI Advisor to BEAT.

Prior to that, he was the Head of Data Science at Verily and built a high-performance AI organization with teams in computational biology, medical device and biosensor algorithms, digital biomarkers, health informatics and digital pathology. He has also held leadership roles at XAI.health, Sentrian, VivoSense, Boston Neurosciences and Vivometrics. He currently serves as a board member for VivoSense and is on the scientific advisory boards of Acorai, XAI.health and Bryte. Dr. Myers received his PhD in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Cape Town in South Africa.\n“Being appointed as Chief AI Scientist is both an honor and an exciting challenge. The HeartBeam technology, when combined with advanced AI, has tremendous potential to unlock and deliver groundbreaking cardiac management solutions spanning diagnostics, screening, predictive analytics and closed-loop patient management – where detection, intervention and real-time measurement continually refine and optimize treatment outcomes.

    "title": "Extensive Guide to iOS 26's Subtle and Overlooked Features",
    "text": "With its many powerful yet understated\nnew features of iOS 26 makes the user experience more seamless, intelligent, and customized than ever. Apple didn’t highlight these features on stage, while Apple’s WWDC stage performance surprised with daring changes like AI integrations and fresh app redesigns. The true beauty of iOS 26 is concealed in the details, weaved into the small, sometimes overlooked elements that truly influence our daily iPhone usage.\niOS 26’s hidden powers that are an exploration of the minor yet revolutionary features Apple didn’t highlight. It is revamping iOS, the software that runs your iPhone, for the first time in more than ten years. They refer to the design of iOS 26 as Liquid Glass. You can anticipate seeing transparent layers and controls that change shape based on your phone’s activity. Both Macs and iPads now have the updated design.\nLet’s break down these design features:\nSleek and Transparent Design\nThe design of your iPhone will be transparent and streamlined. When iOS was first released in 2007, its design was inspired by real-world objects. For example, the port at the bottom of the screen resembled metal mesh, the YouTube icon was an old-fashioned TV, and elements like brushed steel and wood grain were used throughout the programs.\niPhone menus will appear bright, frosted-glass, with faint color accents. Many of the pieces have a slight feeling of depth and are more rounded. The “liquid” portion is exactly that buttons and menus react to your touch, occasionally separating into separate menus. In addition to bright and dark settings, the new design includes an all-clear mode that makes the interface of your iPhone appear semi transparent.\niPhone Now Handle Calls and Messages\nChatting will be simpler with real-time text and call translation. Texts in messages will be automatically translated into the language that the receiver prefers. The speaker’s language will be audible during FaceTime calls, and translations will appear as text. This will also function in standard phone conversations. Even though the person you are calling does not have an iPhone, you will both hear your favorite spoken language.\nShortcuts with AI\nAI capabilities like summarization can be powered by either a local or on the internet model when creating a shortcut.\nBookmarking Features\nSafari has a new bookmarking gesture. Double-tapping the three-dot menu in the latest Safari update allows you to create a shortcut to the page you are currently on.\nScreenshot Menu\nThe layout of the screenshot menu has changed. Asking questions regarding a screenshot is made possible by visual intelligence. The menu will inevitably recommend reading it privately or summarizing any content that is displayed on the screen.\nPodcasts\nThe playing speed options in the new Podcasts app range from 0.5x to 3x. To improve voices, the Podcasts app also features an improved dialog feature. This can be turned on for each individual episode.\nIn the end, iOS 26 is about the dozens of subtle, well-considered improvements that subtly transform the iPhone experience rather than just the large, ostentatious upgrades.\nAs Techi discovers more features in the upcoming iOS 26 version, we will continue to update this list.",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n\"hace falta mucha pedagogía para desprendernos del velo ideológico que llevamos puesto en los ojos y en el cerebro durante siglos. El mismo que otorga la españolidad a Carlos I nacido en Gante y a Felipe V nacido en Versalles, pero que se la niega a Abderramán III que nació en Córdoba de antepasados cordobeses y navarros».\"\n[#3](c3#c-3) esta semana te toca hacer de \"rojo\" ?\nno tengo nada en contra de los carnavales.... pero verte hacer el gili con cada clon da un poco de vergüencita ajena\n[#10](c10#c-10) ¿Disculpe? No sé qué hablas de clones, y no entiendo cómo comentar una obviedad es hacer \"el gili\". Si no eres capaz de ver que la derechita cobarde tira de racismo para ocultar sus miserias y sus taras lógicas es tu problema.\n[#11](c11#c-11) que si hombre que si.... que no se te ve a la legua el disfraz jejeje ... anda, sigue con ello si te divierte.\n[#3](c3#c-3) Hoy todavía hablando con un hombre de unos 43 años me decía: \" hay que volver a echar los moros a pedradas otra vez\" en Asturies, claro. Tan solo \"se bajó\" un poco cuando le contesté que a mí siempre me había robado un blanco y español (soy bastante mayor que el).\nEste es el nivel Maribel.\nUn cordial saludo\nQué buenos eran los romanos, los godos y los ..., ejem, estos últimos no..\nSi la herencia más reciente que tiene la península es la de los pueblos musulmanes: está en todas partes, en el idioma, en la arquitectura, en el arte, en la cocina, en las fiestas, en los dulces (incluso los navideños)... estuvieron 800 años.\nTenéis razón en una cosa, “se aprovecha de la inacción gubernamental, policial y judicial”\nSi el gobierno, la policía y la judicatura actuaran contra la inmigración ilegal, no permitiéndola, no alentándola y juzgando a los delincuentes, no estaría la “ultraderecha” copando nada.\nEs un problema y si no lo cortan y los solucionan, la gente buscará quien los solucione, tenga las siglas que tenga\nCambiarán las leyes con el pretexto de la ultraderecha. La ultraderecha se irá de rositas como siempre. Pero ya estará todo preparado gracias a tanto tonto útil. En cuanto cambie el gobierno las prisiones tendrán un ala reservada para raperos y titiriteros.\n[#12](c12#c-12) Esto también es una bomba de relojería para la derecha, incluso para la derecha dura. Cuanto más radicalices a una parte de la población más extremos se te van a volver. Antes a algunos les valía el PP, después VOX y ahora Alvise, y a la que te despistes aparecerá un señor llamándole a Alvise moro y moderado y lanzará un discurso todavía más radical. Por poder son libres de pedir a los extranjeros la conversión al catolicismo y la castración química para que no se reproduzcan. No lo han hecho a gran escala porque no lo han necesitado, pero todo llegará cuando los discursos habituales dejen de tener efecto.\n[#18](c18#c-18) a la ultraderecha le da igual; la extrema derecha no es una amenaza a las élites, se mueven como pez en el agua a día de hoy en las instituciones europeas. Y estas reformas reaccionarias que se están pidiendo les van como anillo al dedo. Los nazis son los mejores aplicando leyes nazis.\nSi vuelve a venir una gran crisis, que no es descartable, y vuelven a surgir movimientos sociales de izquierdas, como ocurrió después de 2008 y hoy extintos, va a ser mucho más fácil encerrar a cualquiera que asome la cabeza y neutralizar el movimiento de raíz. Vuelta a 1965.\n[#20](c20#c-20) Hombres, les da igual hasta que deja de darles igual. Alvise sigue siendo completamente inofensivo para las élites, pero nada te dice que Alvise+ lo sea. Imagínate que de golpe todo muta en un movimiento que ataca los negocios que tienen inmigrantes empleados. Ahí ya empiezas a joder la economía y a dispararte en el pie.\nEl peligro al final siempre es que la gente que estás radicalizando mute en algo que ya no puedas controlar. Sánchez era el hombre más feliz del mundo cuando veía que iban a por los que estaban a su izquierda y a él lo dejaban en paz. Después él se volvió el comunista radical, y ya no le hacía tanta gracia.\nDe los creadores de \"la ocupación no es un problema, es estadísticamente anecdótica, debemos parar a todas estas empresas de desocupación que proliferan y crecen como champiñones\" y \"los migrantes no son tantos y no consumen recursos, por favor llevaros a unos cuantos que estamos desbordados y sin recursos\"\nSi existe una agenda de ultraderecha fomentando odio irracional al moro, entonces habra una agenda de ultraizquierda fomentando amor incondicional al moro...... es lo malo de los extremos...",

    "text": "Treinador português esteve a minutos de algo raro e impensável: quatro derrotas seguidas em casa na Premier League. Graças a um menino isso não aconteceu\nÉ uma desgraça. Não há muito que se possa dizer do Manchester United, que esta quinta-feira se viu aflito para conseguir arrancar uma vitória em casa contra um ainda mais aflito Southampton, que chegou à 21.ª jornada da Premier League com apenas seis pontos, fruto de uma vitória e de três empates.\nSó que, perante a brutal incapacidade dos comandados de Ruben Amorim, o Southampton parecia aquela equipa que em tempos andava pelos lugares europeus, com jogadores como Sadio Mané ou um Adam Lallana - que está de volta, mas numa fase da carreira completamente diferente. Tudo isto até Amad Diallo ter feito três golos quase vindos do nada.\nNão é que o último classificado da Premier League, que agora passa a ter míseros sete pontos em 63 possíveis, tenha feito uma exibição divinal. É antes o Manchester United que parece capaz de descer a bitola a cada jogo que realiza, mesmo quando consegue feitos como a extraordinária eliminatória contra o Arsenal, que lhe valeu o apuramento para a próxima fase da Taça de Inglaterra.\nA Ruben Amorim, no meio de um marasmo total, valeu a aparição daquele que será o único jogador que tem correspondido totalmente desde a sua chegada. O modesto Amad Diallo, costa-marfinense franzino que quase ninguém conhecia e agora já é o melhor marcador da equipa na liga, voltou a salvar o seu treinador, naquela que é a melhor forma de lhe agradecer a aposta. E foi a única coisa que se salvou.\nO hat-trick de Amad Diallo, feito em apenas 12 mintuos, acaba por salvar Ruben Amorim de um autêntico pesadelo: o Manchester United esteve a perder até bem perto do fim, o que, se se confirmasse, resultaria no quarto jogo seguido a perder em Old Trafford para a Premier League.\nCom esta vitória o Manchester United acaba por saltar para o 12.º lugar, mas se o ambiente que se viveu em Old Trafford depois da reviravolta foi de alívio, paira no ar que está tudo bem longe de estar resolvido, pelo contrário. Sobretudo contra os mais pequenos. Sobretudo em casa.\nÉ que o confronto contra os grandes é mesmo o que Ruben Amorim tem para guardar. Desde que chegou teve cinco jogos contra as outras cinco grandes equipas. Perdeu em Londres com o Arsenal (Premier League) e com o Tottenham (Taça da Liga Inglesa), mas conseguiu vencer o dérbi com o City em pleno Etihad, além de ter arrancado um empate em Anfield contra o todo-poderoso Liverpool (ambos jogos de Premier League). O outro é o tal da Taça de Inglaterra.\nCuriosamente, todos esses jogos foram disputados fora. Em casa, no Teatro dos Sonhos, a história é completamente diferente. E para pior. Em seis jogos disputados em casa desde a chegada de Ruben Amorim, o Manchester United venceu apenas dois: com o Bodo/Glimt e contra o Everton, para Liga Europa e Premier League, respetivamente",
