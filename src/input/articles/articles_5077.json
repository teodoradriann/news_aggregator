    "text": "‘Young guys in Audis. Anti-social drivers. Mums on phones. Lack of police and lights.’ Drivers’ views on the M65, road safety and car culture.\nMotorway safety, lighting, flooding, police patrols and standards of driving are being debated.\nA number of east Lancashire councils including Pendle have called for a review of arrangements on the M65.\nMotorway safety, lighting, flooding, police patrols and standards of driving are being debated.\nConcerns about concrete barriers possibly causing flooding, the removal of lights at some sections, the merging of traffic lanes, driving, speeding and police coverage have been raised.\nLancashire’s Police & Crime Commissioner, Clive Grunshaw, has defended officers’ policing of the M65 amid a number of fatal incidents and criticism of police force budget cuts.\nDrivers in Nelson have given their views.\nErgin Gulgec, from Burnley, said: “From my experience, the problem in this area seems to be that certain types of drivers have no respect for the road lanes, for the Highway Code, for driving manners or etiquette.\n“I cannot understand it. What makes a certain type of person behave like that? Why do they think they have a right to drive that way? I don’t see this so much in other areas. Yes, you see ‘white van men’ everywhere. But not this local scene with younger guys in Audis?\n“When I was younger, I lived in Oxfordshire. Then, there were community police officers. Drivers who might have committed small errors would be ‘told-off’ by the police. Local police were much more abundant. But those days are gone.”\nHis son, Tom, said: “I have a driving licence but I don’t drive regularly. I live in a bigger city so tend to travel mainly by train. In my experience, being in a car can be quite a hostile experience. It can be worrying when a car races past you in a built-up area. You think ‘bloody hell’. And you see accidents and incidents which make you wonder what could have caused them?\n“I think there’s a culture around cars and behaving certain ways among some young drivers. Maybe there is a need for some kind of community education, to raise awareness among young people? Perhaps like rehabilitation schemes for people in knife crime or other problems?”\nJohn Banks, of Nelson, said: “There is a lot of anti-social behaviour with cars going around the streets, especially at night. Nelson is a different town after 11pm. You can see where cars have hit barriers and buildings. There’s been at least two fatalities in Nelson town centre. Places around Manchester Road, Carr Road and St Mary’s Church are bad. A couple were knocked over by a quad bike. There’s been a cluster of incidents around the junctions.\n“The standard of driving and car safety here is abysmal. You see lots of near-misses as you drive around. Outside schools, mums are dropping-off their kids in cars while being on the phone. And kids aren’t wearing seat belts.\n“The M65 has bad lighting and floods happen near the concrete barriers. There’s nowhere for the water to go. Drivers are aquaplaning. They lose control. They can’t see the water on the motorway because it’s so dark.\n“I think we need more police in town centres and on the M65. Motorways are also fast routes and and out of places. Criminals can get in and out of towns or villages quickly, and transport things like drugs.”\nTaxi driver Nasir Mahmood said: “Some drivers go far-too fast. I might be going at 70mph on the motorway and they flash passed me. There seems to be young people who are taking risks and perhaps showing off? Taxi drivers have to be patient.\n“I used to drive in Germany, where the motorways tend to be very straight and have the same number of lanes. They are simpler. In the UK, some motorways can be curved and the number of lanes can change from three to two. But I don’t think motorway design is really the problem. I think it’s about how people drive.\n“But I also think darkness is a problem. I drive mainly in the daytime but I know it can be difficult at night. Lighting is really important and is needed.\n“I know flooding on the M65 has been a worry too. And a few weeks ago there was snow and one lane was blocked. But, for me, lighting is really needed. It’s dark for long periods in December and January. Thankfully, the evenings will get a bit lighter in February and March.”\nHear all the latest news from across the UK on the hour, every hour, on Greatest Hits Radio on DAB, smartspeaker, at greatesthitsradio.co.uk, and on the Rayo app.",

    "text": "- Indigenous leaders gathered at New York Climate Week to call on global leaders to address the unprecedented drought and wildfire crisis in the Amazon Rainforest. - Chief Raoni Metuktire, a historic Indigenous leader of Brazil, asked non-Indigenous communities to reflect on their responsibility — mainly the introduction of illegal mining, logging and cattle ranching that are accelerating the impacts of climate change. - Many Indigenous communities are in the path of wildfires, and isolated Indigenous peoples (PIA) are the most vulnerable. Indigenous leaders from South America issued a cry for help at New York Climate Week on Sept. 25. Representatives from Brazil, Ecuador and Peru gathered at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, where they urgently called on the international community to act on the unprecedented drought and fire crisis impacting the Amazon Rainforest. Chief Raoni Metuktire, one of the most renowned Indigenous leaders in Brazil and the world, called on non-Indigenous communities to take responsibility for their share of the problem. “White people are contributing to the destruction of the forest,” said the chief, who is now 92 years old. “I’m very concerned with their way of life leading to the destruction of living beings and our planet.” Raoni was especially critical of non-Indigenous communities’ introduction of extractive industries now prevalent in the Amazon. Illegal mining, logging and cattle ranching are degrading the rainforest, impacting water sources and drying the land. These activities are exacerbating the impacts of climate change, to which Indigenous people already contribute very little. “We need white men on our side to save the Amazon from destruction,” said the chief, who was born in the Kayapó territory. The land, located in São Félix do Xingu, in the southern Amazon, has recently lost 4,000 hectares (9,884 acres) due to a wildfire that is still burning . It’s the most burnt Indigenous territory in Brazil this year — almost 20% has been blazed. “We need to mobilize the nations of every country to make a large movement to stop this destruction,” he pleaded. Toya Manchineri, another Indigenous leader at the event, said he believes the solution also lies in demarcating Indigenous territories. “We need global leaders gathered here in New York to make this a priority,” he said, referring to the United Nations General Assembly that is also happening this week in the city. “The designation of Indigenous land should be considered part of every country’s climate policies.” Manchineri, born in the Mamoadate Indigenous Territory in Brazil, is the general coordinator of COIAB, a network of Indigenous organizations of the Brazilian Amazon. The entity has long argued that designating Indigenous territories is crucial for the Amazon’s climate resilience. Science has shown that these communities not only maintain the forest intact but can also reverse the deforestation that has already taken place. Fire threatens isolated communities The Amazon is experiencing its worst drought recorded in 151 years. According to COIAB’s recent report, “ The Amazon on the Brink of Collapse ,” 149 Indigenous territories are under severe or extreme drought conditions. Of these, 42 are facing extreme drought, which implies limited access to food and drinking water. In the Munduruku territory, communities are drinking mercury-polluted water due to low river levels. A drier and more flammable forest is also triggering a record number of wildfires. The report estimates an 80% increase in wildfires in the region in 2024. In August alone, fires destroyed 2.5 million hectares (6.2 million acres), equivalent to 3.5 million soccer fields. More than 4,000 wildfires remain active, about one-third on Indigenous territories. According to COIAB, the situation is dangerous for all Indigenous communities in the Amazon, but isolated Indigenous peoples (PIA) are the most vulnerable. Several are in the path of wildfires, and at least six communities are already suffering from critical water shortages and agricultural losses. The entity is concerned with their well-being and the possibility these isolated groups might be forced into contact with outsiders. As combat forces work to tame the flames, they might encounter them inadvertently without the necessary training to deal with these communities. “The fires are quickly advancing toward the territories of isolated Indigenous people,” said Angela Kaxuyana, an Indigenous leader of the Kahyana people of Brazil who also spoke at the event. “The world needs to stop everything immediately and ask their political leaders to help us. This could be our last chance to save them,” she said. The International Working Group of Indigenous Peoples in Isolation and Initial Contact estimates there are 185 isolated Indigenous peoples in South America . Meanwhile, the Brazilian federal government has recorded 114 within Brazil’s Legal Amazon . They are already threatened by loss of territory, diseases and violence. Climate change is now considered an emerging risk. “Everyone here is concerned with making big carbon market deals,” Kaxuyana said of New York Climate Week. “But Indigenous people are literally burning. We are not talking just about the loss of forests, animals and species. We are talking about the potential loss of life.” Banner image: Indigenous leaders from South America, such as Chief Raoni Metuktire (at the center), spoke during the New York Climate Week to denounce the suffering of Amazon communities during extreme drought and fire outbreaks.

    "text": "Administración El Ayuntamiento de Murcia vende su antigua flota de limpieza por 400.000 euros Prezero compra 189 vehículos del servicio que pasaron a manos municipales tras su amortización y renovación después de 10 años La renovación de los vehículos de limpieza que prestaban servicio en Murcia ha permitido, además de ganar en sostenibilidad y ofrecer un mejor servicio a los ciudadanos, ingresar en las arcas municipales más de 400.000 euros. El Pliego de Condiciones Técnicas del contrato establecía la amortización de los vehículos una vez que cumplieran servicio durante 10 años y su sustitución por maquinaria nueva, es decir, la flota antigua formada por 210 vehículos pasó a manos municipales. En ese momento, el Consistorio inicio una consulta preliminar (proceso al que está obligado por La Ley de Contratos del Sector Público) realizada por el Servicio de Contratación para analizar si existían operadores interesados en esta maquinaria, pero no se obtuvo ninguna respuesta. Poco después, con el objetivo de garantizar la salvaguarda de los intereses del Ayuntamiento, se realizó una segunda consulta preliminar, esta vez dividiendo los vehículos por lotes, pero este proceso tampoco culminó en una oferta firme. Finalmente, ha sido la propia empresa concesionaria, Prezero, la que ha adquirido la mayor parte de los vehículos: 189, que a su vez podría vender a otros operadores. Desde el Ayuntamiento explican que se han quedado 21 vehículos para el área de Servicios Generales, con un valor de tasación de algo más de 21.600 euros. Además, del total de vehículos adquiridos por Prezero, 35 los destinará (después de reacondicionarlos) a la concesión municipal como reserva, para refuerzos o sustituciones en momentos puntuales. Con respecto a la tasación, fuentes municipales indican que los vehículos antiguos fueron tasados en un principio en 318.000 euros por la empresa de limpieza, mientras que la tasación que encargó el Ayuntamiento elevó la cifra hasta casi los 359.000 euros. Finalmente, la oferta realizada por Prezero tras el alza del Índice de Precios de ´Fabricación de otra maquinaria para usos específicos´ elevó la cantidad por encima de los 400.000 euros. Entre los vehículos se encuentran todo tipo de modelos, desde los recolectores de carga lateral y trasera hasta equipos ‘quitachicles’, barredoras de arrastre, baldeadoras de aceras, furgones, o vehículos de transporte e inspección, entre otros. «Doble beneficio» Según fuentes municipales, con esta operación se consigue «un doble beneficio, por un lado se cuenta con una flota más eficaz y sostenible y menos ruidosa y, por otro, se consigue un importante ingreso en las arcas municipales». Cabe destacar que la flota que ha logrado vender el Consistorio murciano se encuentra en una parcela privada ubicada en el Polígono Industrial Oeste de Murcia. Según ha podido saber esta Redacción este solar está alquilado por Prezero, la concesionaria del servicio, a un particular y tras esta operación es previsible que se pueda liberar del alquiler. n [RRSS WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=El%20Ayuntamiento%20de%20Murcia%20vende%20su%20antigua%20flota%20de%20limpieza%20por%20400.000%20euros%20https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/murcia/2024/10/04/ayuntamiento-murcia-vende-antigua-flota-108888549.html%3Futm_source%3Dwhatsapp%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share) [RRSS Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/murcia/2024/10/04/ayuntamiento-murcia-vende-antigua-flota-108888549.html%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share) [RRSS Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/murcia/2024/10/04/ayuntamiento-murcia-vende-antigua-flota-108888549.html&text=El%20Ayuntamiento%20de%20Murcia%20vende%20su%20antigua%20flota%20de%20limpieza%20por%20400.000%20euros%20%20https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/murcia/2024/10/04/ayuntamiento-murcia-vende-antigua-flota-108888549.html%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share%20a%20trav%C3%A9s%20de%20%40diariolaopinion) [RRSS email](mailto:?subject=El%20Ayuntamiento%20de%20Murcia%20vende%20su%20antigua%20flota%20de%20limpieza%20por%20400.000%20euros%20&body=https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/murcia/2024/10/04/ayuntamiento-murcia-vende-antigua-flota-108888549.html%3Futm_source%3Dmail%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dbtn-share) [Copiar URL](javascript: void(0)) Noticia guardada en tu perfil [Aviso de la Guardia Civil: si compras esto en Aliexpress, te llega una multa de 800 euros](https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/vida-y-estilo/2024/10/01/aviso-guardia-civil-compras-aliexpress-108805452.html)[Aviso de la Guardia Civil: prohibido llevar esta tarjeta en la cartera a partir de ahora](https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/vida-y-estilo/2024/10/03/aviso-guardia-civil-prohibido-llevar-dv-108866343.html)[Alerta de la Policía Nacional; si te paran por la calle y te dicen esto, mucho cuidado](https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/vida-y-estilo/2024/10/04/aviso-policia-nacional-paran-calle-dv-108908613.html)[Temu, Shein y Aliexpress en Murcia; abre la 'macrotienda' barata que trae los productos más famosos de Internet](https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/buzzeando/2024/10/01/temu-shein-aliexpress-murcia-abre-dv-108798175.html)[Adiós al otoño en Murcia: Roberto Brasero alerta de qué va a ocurrir a partir del miércoles](https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/buzzeando/2024/10/01/adios-otono-murcia-roberto-brasero-dv-108802600.html)[Octubre llega a la Región de Murcia y este es el aviso de Jorge Rey sobre el tiempo: 'A partir del martes](https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/buzzeando/2024/09/30/octubre-llega-region-murcia-aviso-dv-108739232.html)[Manolo García: '¿Pero estas personas que no paran de contaminar no tienen hijos, nietos?](https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/cultura/2024/10/04/manolo-garcia-murcia-personas-paran-contaminar-108884296.html)[Crisis en el Ayuntamiento de Murcia por la despedida de dos altos cargos](https://www.laopiniondemurcia.es/murcia/2024/10/01/crisis-ayuntamiento-murcia-despedida-altos-108770208.html)",

    "text": "Common household product identified as cause of home explosion in Maine neighborhood, officials say SINCLAIR, Maine ( [WAGM](https://www.wagmtv.com/2024/08/14/propane-explosion-sinclair-highlights-dangers-safety-precautions/)/Gray News) - Officials said a product many people use was the cause of an explosion that took place in Maine on Saturday. The Maine Fire Marshal’s Office said the explosion in Sinclair was caused by propane, with the gas igniting and leading to mass destruction in a neighborhood. Barabra Deschaine said she was at home when her neighbor’s house exploded. “I heard a boom and I felt like the floor was going to cave into the cellar and the roof was going to fall in on top of me,” she said. “I looked out the window, and there was debris flying all over.” The Fire Marshal’s Office said the propane explosion sent debris across the street, into the nearby lakes and onto the rooftops of neighboring buildings. Deschaine’s home was damaged when debris from the explosion blew through the walls of the garage. Windows were blown out in other neighboring buildings. Another residence caught fire before it was destroyed. “We’re fortunate that so many fire departments came to help because it could have been a lot worse,” Deschaine said. Propane is a gas people commonly use and have in their homes. Although it is used daily, it can be dangerous if used incorrectly. Propane leaks can happen for many reasons, including valves left open, old tanks used, or pressure changes, among other reasons. When a leak happens, the gas can give off a distinct smell. However, even with the distinct smell, North Lakes Deputy Fire Chief Derrick Ouellette said the gas may not be noticed. “Propane is heavier in the air so it tends to lie in low places so sometimes it is hard to detect,” he said. Ouellette said there are other ways to watch for a propane leak if the smell cannot be detected. “If your consumption has gone up and you haven’t used any more than usual, there’s a sign right there,” he said. He recommends that people who use propane also use propane gas detectors as a precaution. Copyright 2024 WAGM via Gray Local Media, Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "© Reuters. British Defence Secretary Grant Shapps walks to attend a cabinet meeting in London, Britain, March 6, 2024. REUTERS/Toby Melville LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will increase its spending on drones for Ukraine by 125 million pounds ($160 million), raising the total number of drones supplied to more than 10,000, the government said on Thursday as Defence Secretary Grant Shapps visited Kyiv.\nWHY IT'S IMPORTANT\nBritain's support comes at a crucial time for Ukraine in the two-year war. Vital U.S. military aid has stalled, while Russia's offensive looks more assertive after it took the city of Avdiivka last month, its biggest gain since May 2023.\nDrones, which are cheap to produce and can conduct surveillance or target enemies with great accuracy, have emerged as a key weapon in the conflict, with both Ukraine and Russia striving for the upper hand in technology.\nKEY Quote: S\n\"I am ramping up our commitment to arm Ukraine with cutting-edge new drones coming directly from the UK's world-leading defence industries - straight from the factory floor to the frontline. I encourage international partners to join the UK in this effort,\" Shapps said, as he met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\nBY THE NUMBERS\nBritain said it would expand its drone package to 325 million pounds from the 200 million pounds announced in January.\nThe package includes thousands of first-person view drones, 1,000 one-way attack drones researched and developed in Britain as well as surveillance and maritime drones.\n($1 = 0.7833 pounds)\nBritain increases drone funding for Ukraine by over $150 million",

    "text": "PA Media: UK News Dublin is safe compared to other western cities, Varadkar insists Read full article David Young, PA December 29, 2023 at 9:10 a.m. · 3 min read Dublin is a safe city when compared with others in the western world, the Taoiseach has insisted.\nLeo Varadkar said while it is important to acknowledge and listen to the experiences of those who have fallen victim to crime in Dublin, he insisted such incidents are not the norm for Ireland’s capital.\nThere has been an increased focus on safety in Dublin following a series of well publicised random attacks and assaults on people in the city.\nThat scrutiny intensified after the events of November 23, when rioting broke out in the city centre following a knife attack on three young children and their care assistant outside a primary school.\nTaoiseach Leo Varadkar made the comments during his end of year media briefing (Niall Carson/PA) Opposition parties claim a reduction in Garda numbers has contributed to a situation where parts of the city are no longer safe. It is a charge the Government has rejected.\nMr Varadkar was asked about the issue of safety in Dublin at his end of year media briefing with political journalists.\n“There’s no city that’s 100% safe,” he said.\n“If you look at something like the murder rate, for example, in Ireland or Dublin, compare that to other countries or other major cities, you’ll see that Dublin and Ireland are relatively safe relative to other countries and other cities in the western world.\n“But there’s no place that’s 100% safe and I acknowledge that. What I say to people is that we’re taking actions in all of these areas, increasing Garda numbers and Garda resources, making our laws tougher, with tougher sentences in particular, appointing more judges, expanding our prison places.\n“(There is) also a big focus now on community safety partnerships, because it can’t be all just about a law and order response. Other things are important too, including things like street lighting, like cameras, like engaging with different services around addiction and mental health and so on. That’s the approach that we’re taking.”\nA burned out bus is removed from O’Connell Street in Dublin in the aftermath of violent scenes in the city centre on November 23 (Brian Lawless/PA) Asked how he responded to accounts from individuals who have been assaulted in the capital, the Taoiseach added: “Of course I am concerned about individual negative experiences that people have in Dublin or anywhere else. That’s something you’re very aware of and very exposed to as a politician.\nStory continues “Somebody would have maybe a very bad experience of our health service. But I’m also aware of the counterfactual or the other sides of the story, if you’d like, the huge number of people who have a very positive experience of our health service, for example and say so when surveyed.\n“The same thing applies to people coming into town, coming into our cities and coming into our country.\n“Most people, thankfully, don’t experience being victims of violent crime in Dublin or anywhere else.\n“While it’s really important that we listen to and acknowledge the stories of people who have a very bad experience, we have a responsibility as politicians and journalists not to make the mistake of thinking that bad experiences are the majority or are the norm.”\nTRENDING 1.

    "text": "Selon le gouvernement, l'investissement à hauteur de 22 milliards de livres sterling sur 25 ans doit permettre de développer des projets qui créeront 4.000 emplois (50.000 à long terme). Le gouvernement britannique va annoncer vendredi un investissement de près de 22 milliards de livres sterling sur 25 ans pour développer des projets de captage et stockage de carbone, avec l'objectif de stimuler la croissance et de réduire les émissions de CO2. Ces projets vont permettre de \"raviver nos centres industriels en investissant dans l'industrie du futur\", doit dire le Premier ministre Keir Starmer, arrivé au pouvoir en juillet après la victoire des travaillistes aux élections législatives. Il va annoncer trois pôles de captage du carbone dans les anciennes zones industrielles du nord-ouest de l'Angleterre - dans la région de Liverpool - et du nord-est.\nLe captage et le stockage du carbone (CCUS) consistent à capter les émissions en sortie d'usines (centrales électriques, cimenteries, hauts fourneaux...), avant qu'il ne parte dans l'atmosphère. Cette technologie prévoit de les injecter en profondeur dans des réservoirs géologiques ou de les réutiliser. Selon le gouvernement, ces projets vont permettre de créer 4.000 emplois (50.000 à long terme) et vont générer 8 milliards d'investissements privés. Ils doivent aussi aider le Royaume-Uni à atteindre ses objectifs pour le climat en réduisant les émissions de carbone dans l'atmosphère de 8,5 millions de tonnes par an. Le stockage devrait démarrer à partir de 2028.\nGreenpeace critique un investissement \"qui va prolonger\" la production d'hydrocarbures Le Climate Change Committee, l'organisme chargé de conseiller l'exécutif sur sa stratégie climatique, salue ce projet. \"C'est fantastique de voir le financement de ces grands projets se concrétiser\", a réagi James Richardson, directeur de ce Comité. \"Nous ne pouvons pas atteindre les objectifs climat du pays sans le CCUS. Cet engagement est donc très rassurant\", a-t-il ajouté.\nEn revanche, Greenpeace critique l'annonce du gouvernement. \"22 milliards de livres sterling, c'est beaucoup d'argent à dépenser pour quelque chose qui va prolonger la durée de vie de la production de pétrole et de gaz qui réchauffe la planète \", a déploré Doug Parr, un responsable de l'ONG au Royaume-Uni.\n\"La majeure partie de cet argent devrait plutôt être investie dans la création de nouveaux emplois dans les industries vertes de l'avenir, comme l'éolien en mer, ou dans un programme national pour isoler les logements\", a-t-il ajouté.

    "title": "CNA and ASJ, “are not auditors, they do not fight corruption” and they remained silent during the previous government, says Redondo",
    "text": "Tegucigalpa.- The President of the National Congress, Luis Redondo, once again dedicated a few minutes in his speech at yesterday’s plenary session to attack the National Anti-Corruption Council (CNA) and the Association for a More Just Society (ASJ), who he said are not supervisors, do not fight corruption and cannot summon deputies.\nThe statements by the head of Parliament were made in response to criticism from both civil society organizations regarding the delay in approving the budget of the National Electoral Council (CNE) that guarantees the primary and general elections next year.\nHe specifically attacked the representative of the Association for a More Just Society (ASJ), Carlos Hernández, who asserted that drug trafficking financing for politics will continue because the required electoral reforms have not been made.\n“I want to refute these braggarts, especially because the only request we had in this branch of the State, which is in consultation, from the Clean Policy Unit is an increase of 10 million (lempiras) and that they become an autonomous body because the approved funds are approved for the National Electoral Council and then they are transferred to them,” he explained.\nI ask Carlos Hernandez: “Why didn’t they say anything about the financing of drug trafficking when it has been revealed in the United States courts of justice? Why did they keep quiet for decades? Of course, it is natural that they kept quiet because they even helped to whitewash Honduras with a false signature that was made with Transparency International.”\nRedondo mentioned that there are many who have conflicts of interest because they were helping drug trafficking and corruption in the country.\nHe added that “this group of friends who get together to distort the news because there are many people here who have nothing to do and love to go around making things up.”\nAs is his custom, Redondo read his traditional “legal analyses” to criticize the work done by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and even listed the cases in which the legal status of these civil society entities can be removed.\nHe said that both the CNA and ASJ are not supervisory bodies and do not fight corruption.\n“Neither the CNA, nor ASJ, nor the friend they have, who by the way is extremely offensive and irrational, none of them have the powers that they have conferred and they should not continue lying to the Honduran people,” he said.\nShe revealed that she has information about a case in which the previous Attorney General covered up the head of the CNA and that is why she never took action against him.\nThe head of the Legislative Assembly claimed that the fact that an International Anti-Corruption Mission (CICIH) is currently being sought in the country “only reflects the historical failure of the CNA in Honduras.”\nNC Budget\nHe listed some historical facts about the last elections in Honduras. He pointed out that for the 2021 elections, decree 157-2020 was approved on November 26, 2020 and published in La Gaceta on December 30, 2020.\nLikewise – Redondo continued – for the November 2021 elections, decree 60-2021 was approved on August 5, 2021.\nMeanwhile, for the 2017 elections, decree 171-2016 was approved on December 15, 2016 and published in La Gaceta on December 26.\n“All those who repeat that we are delaying the approval of the budget should look at history and I assure you that all those who remained silent in this case, who today make assertions that we do not want to approve the budget, I assure you that we will approve it, and we will also approve the money that is needed to ensure democracy,” he concluded.\nRelated",
