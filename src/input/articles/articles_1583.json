    "title": "Tekken: When Did Fists Take a Backseat to Firearms?",
    "text": "Tekken, a series that once stood as a hallmark for martial arts gaming, has recently seen a growing discontent among its dedicated fanbase. The traditional values of hand-to-hand combat have seemingly taken a backseat as firearms and other unconventional weapons inch their way into the fray, leaving many players scratching their heads in disbelief. The community discussion, spearheaded by a post titled “Fuck guns” from user Snoo_47323, highlights the frustrations of longtime fans who mourn the loss of the game’s original identity. As the world of Tekken evolves, many are left wondering whether it’s still the game they fell in love with, or if it has strayed too far from its roots.\nSummary\n- Players feel the addition of guns and firearms detracts from the essence of martial arts that defined the series.\n- Many fans yearn for a return to the unique character designs and fighting styles that made Tekken special.\n- Some players are open to the evolution of the game but express concern about its identity as a martial arts franchise.\n- The community expresses a desire for a balance between innovations and the core elements of the original gameplay.\nFading Martial Arts Heritage\nOne of the most discussed issues stemming from the post is the feeling that Tekken has drifted away from its martial arts roots. Snoo_47323 argues passionately that the franchise was built on the concept of “Iron Fist,” which pivotal in creating a cast of characters who fought with their bare hands – showcasing a rich tapestry of fighting styles varying from karate to judo. Players fondly recall how each character embodied their unique martial art, making it easy to appreciate their individuality. As one user, Mr_Horsejr, aptly quipped, “Soulless Calibur is more like it,” capturing the essence of how fans perceive the shift towards an emphasis on weaponry. The sentiment of nostalgia paints a clear picture of the community’s desire to recapture that martial arts magic.\nCharacter Identity Crisis\nAdding to the discontent is the change in character identities and fighting styles, which fans feel has muddled the core essence of what made each character distinctive. For instance, Jenna, a dedicated supporter of Tekken, laments the dilution of Jin’s fighting style. Once rooted in Kyokushin Karate, she argues, “He’s become like a character straight out of an anime,” reflecting how characters seem to share an increasingly homogenized look and fighting style. This homogenization appears to dissolve the unique character quirks that originally drew players to the franchise. SkeletonCircus echoed these feelings, noting that while weapon choices like Law’s nunchucks may fit, “it’s become a bit too crazy overall.” The disorienting changes lead many to appreciate the importance of distinctiveness among fighters and their martial arts principles.\nWeapons as a Narrative Choice\nDespite the backlash against guns, there are fans robustly defending the narrative choice to include firearms, citing the context of the game’s current storyline. Reasonable-Freedom59 provides a contrasting perspective by noting that the backdrop for Tekken 8 involves a full-scale war between factions, suggesting that the introduction of weapons aligns with the game’s direction. “In Tekken 8, there isn’t any real tournament,” he states, thereby justifying the presence of firearms as part of the overarching conflict. This perspective invites a thoughtful discussion about the tension between maintaining a martial arts-driven gameplay versus adhering to the game’s narrative themes. While some fans are willing to explore these new territories, others continue to be frustrated, wishing that the core focus on hand-to-hand combat remains unscathed.\nThe Future of the Franchise\nWith Tekken 8 already stirring controversy, some users have suggested radical solutions, including a complete reboot of the series. Krizalid70559 states, “I feel like they might as well reboot the series after Tekken 8,” articulating how fans feel inundated by the escalating absurdity in character designs and gameplay. Such drastic suggestions underscore a deep-seated anxiety within the community—if the franchise continues down this path, is it still Tekken? It leaves fans in a precarious position, questioning whether change will destructively alter a beloved series. These discussions hint at a longing for a reset that could breathe new life into action while fulfilling the nostalgic cravings of long-time players. Whether the team at Bandai Namco will heed this collective call remains to be seen.\nAs gamers gather around this fiery debate, it’s clear that the heart of Tekken has been stirred by recent changes. While not every fan will agree on the necessity of firearms in a martial arts game, the essence of this conversation embodies the broader struggles of maintaining a tradition while stepping into novel territories of gameplay. Whether Tekken will ultimately embrace its roots or continue to forge a new path remains an evolving narrative, yet one thing stands potent—fans will always advocate fiercely for the game they cherish, keeping its spirit alive through discussion, critique, and vibrant opinions.",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\nDesde los templarios, los Borgia, el banco Ambrosiano, etc., son tantos los casos que indican que su reino sí es de este mundo, que levanta el ánimo ver que todavía quedan personas dentro de esta institución que creen en algunos pilares éticos. Abogo por más información directa, concreta, constante, para que poco a poco los sinvergüenzas queden cada vez más arrinconados en una sociedad cada vez más autocrítica.\n[#1](c1#c-1) ¿Tantos casos? Te has tenido que remontar a 1982 (Banco Ambrosiano), Los Borgia (siglo XVI) y ni más ni menos que los templarios (siglo XII) para poner ejemplos. Te pregunto ¿realmente es algo habitual o es anecdótico teniendo en cuenta la extensión en el tiempo y en el espacio que tiene la Iglesia?\nQue miren en la fundación Las Edades del Hombre y en la Junta de Castilla y Leon y verán el lodazal de mierda que hay\n[#10](c10#c-10) [#17](c17#c-17) Buff... Me contesto solo:\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=\"las edades del hombre corrupción\"\n[#2](c2#c-2) Hasta que te informas y resulta que te obligan a hacer chorrocientos trámites y papeleos, además de visitas a parroquias buscando tu registro. Este coñazo echa a mucha gente para atrás.\nYa que en Hacienda se integran tan bien con la iglesia para la X del IRPF, a ver cuándo ponen otra casilla al lado de \"QUIERO APOSTATAR\".\n[#4](c4#c-4) [#2](c2#c-2) https://www.google.com/amp/s/cadenaser.com/nacional/2023/04/06/apostatar-en-espana-sin-datos-oficiales-y-con-un-proceso-relativamente-sencillo-cadena-ser/%3foutputType=amp gracias a los 2, al menos me habéis hecho replantearme la necesidad de intentarlo.\n[#4](c4#c-4) Es más fácil de lo que piensas:\nhttps://apostatar.wordpress.com/como-apostatar-informacion-practica/\n[#4](c4#c-4) lo hacen tan difícil que al final, lo más rápido es ir a su templo y mearse en la pila del agua, a ver si así aceleran los trámites,\n[#22](c22#c-22) Ellos encantados si te meas en la pila del agua. No te borran del registro, te denuncian, te meten a la cárcel y ahí con un funcionario capellán, pagado de tus impuestos, te van a estar dando la turra sin posibilidad de defenderte.\nY no cambiarían ni el agua de la pila\n[#2](c2#c-2) Me parece estupendo, pero no creo que tenga consecuencias reales.\nLo que hay que hacer es no darles ni un céntimo, ni a nivel particular, ni desde el gobierno, aunque esto es bastante difícil hoy por hoy.\nY hacer proselitismo del ateísmo como si fuera otra religión, que mucha gente simplemente pasa.\nDe toda maneras, tienen tal capital inmobiliario, que es imposible dejarles en la ruina. Como suelo decir, se van a convertir en una multinacional inmobiliaria.\nEste obispo es especialmente intenso en lo que al pecunio se refiere. Desde su entrada en el obispado está siempre en portadas locales y nunca por temas espirituales. Ha liquidado negocios solidarios que llevaban décadas instituidos, ha desahuciado a comunidades religiosas, ha vendido propiedades a empresas del sector educativo privado de cierta tendencia...\nIglesia S.A. es como suelen llamar la engendro que preside.",

    "text": "HUELVA 1 Nov. (EUROPA PRESS) -\nLa Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet) ha vuelto a ampliar, en este caso hasta las 15.00 horas de este viernes, 1 de noviembre, el aviso rojo por lluvias en el litoral de Huelva, mientras que en las comarcas de Aracena, Andévalo y Condado el aviso continúa siendo naranja por lluvias y amarillo por tormentas.\nAsí lo han indicado a Europa Press desde el servicio de Emergencias 112 Andalucía. La Aemet prevé que en el litoral de Huelva la precipitación acumulada en doce horas ha sido de 140 litros por metro cuadrado, y se estima que continúen con \"gran intensidad\" las lluvias en la zona de aviso \"durante las próximas horas\".\nDe otro lado, en la zona de Aracena la precipitación acumulada en una hora es de 30 litros por metro cuadrado, al igual que en el Andévalo y en el Condado onubense. Asimismo, el 112 ha indicado que las incidencias rozan ya el centenar, y que los últimos avisos se han dado en La Antilla (Lepe), Isla Cristina y Cartaya, nuevamente por anegaciones en sótanos y entrada de agua en viviendas.\nPor otra parte, el alcalde de Punta Umbría, José Carlos Hernández Cansino, ha remitido un audio a los medios informando de que la noche ha sido \"tensa\" con grandes lluvias y tormentas eléctricas, así como ha subrayado que las precipitaciones han sido de \"119 litros por metro cuadrado\".\nAl respecto, ha apuntado que \"no hay que destacar daños especiales, nada más que daños en algunos bajos, algunas zonas de casas en las que ha entrado agua\" y \"calles que se han inundado, pero que ya prácticamente están volviendo a la normalidad\".\nEl alcalde de Punta Umbría, que ha pedido \"precaución\" a la población, ha explicado que \"han estado cortadas las carreteras de acceso a Punta Umbría, tanto la autovía que viene de Huelva como las que unen la zona de El Portil con Cartaya y la carretera de Malpica\", pero que \"ya se han abierto y han vuelto a la normalidad\", así como en la zona del Rincón ha habido \"algún problema más, porque el arroyo que discurre por allí se ha desbordado\", pero \"no hay que lamentar ningún tipo de daño personal\".\nEn Cartaya, el Ayuntamiento ha indicado en su cuenta de Facebook que está activo el Plan Local de Emergencias y que las lluvias han provocado el corte de algunos tramos de carretera que unen el municipio con su núcleo de El Rompido, así como se han registrado hundimientos e inundaciones en algunos tramos de calzada y principalmente en bajos y garajes en El Rompido y El Portil y el parking del hotel Nuevo Portil Golf.\nEl alcalde, Manuel Barroso, ha pedido a los ciudadanos \"precaución y responsabilidad\" y que, \"en la medida de lo posible\" eviten desplazamientos y sigan \"en todo momento\" las indicaciones de los Cuerpos y Fuerzas de Seguridad del Estado y de los dispositivos de emergencias que están trabajando \"para garantizar la seguridad ciudadana\".\nLeer más acerca de: AEMET Huelva",

Eso está por encima de lo político, lo racial, lo religioso. Estamos al servicio de la humanidad”, declaró en entrevista.\nEl líder recordó que los Topos surgieron tras los sismos de 1985 en la Ciudad de México y han estado presentes en tragedias como el ataque a las Torres Gemelas, tsunamis, deslaves y huracanes.\nLas labores continúan en una amplia zona del río, donde los Topos trabajan codo a codo con policías estatales, alguaciles y rescatistas locales. “Aquí no importa el idioma ni la nacionalidad, somos una sola familia”, dijo Méndez.\nBajo el intenso sol texano, los voluntarios mexicanos mantienen su compromiso: “No es cuestión de si te dejan entrar o no. Vienes con el poder del amor, y el amor abre puertas, rompe muros y ablanda corazones”, sentenció.\nTE PODRÍA INTERESAR: [“¡Que viva México!”: “topos” mexicanos buscan a desaparecidos en Valencia por la DANA]\n¿Quiénes son los Topos Azteca?\n- Organización civil de rescate fundada en 1985\n- Han operado en más de 20 países\n- Participaron en desastres como: Torres Gemelas (2001), huracán Katrina (2005), sismos en Haití (2010) y explosiones en Tlahuelilpan (2019).",
