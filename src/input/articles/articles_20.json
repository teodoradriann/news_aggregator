    "title": "Emmanuel Macron thanks Xi Jinping for ‘commitment’ not to sell arms to Russia | South China Morning Post",
    "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed China’s “commitment” not to sell arms to Russia and to control the flow of dual-use goods to the Russian military, on the first day of Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s six-day tour of Europe.\\n“We welcome the commitments of the Chinese authorities to abstain from selling any arms to Moscow and control strictly the exports of dual-use goods,” Macron said amid a flurry of meetings in Paris, Agence France-Presse reported.\\n\\nSuch a commitment would represent a breakthrough for Europe, which has long lobbied Xi to use his influence with Russian President Vladimir Putin to help end the war in Ukraine.\\nXi is in France for his first European tour for five years. The two-day visit will be followed by stop-offs in Serbia and Hungary.\\nIn Paris, Ukraine has featured prominently on the agenda. European officials believe dual-use goods, such as microchips and satellite imaging equipment, are helping to power Moscow’s war machine.\\nMacron also thanked Xi for backing his idea for an “Olympic truce” – which would see all global conflicts pause during the Paris Olympics in July and August.\\nXi, in comments Quote: d by Xinhua, warned against “smearing” China over Ukraine.\\n“We oppose using the Ukraine crisis to cast blame, smear a third country and incite a new Cold War,” Xi said, as both leaders gave statements.\\nXi said China was “not watching the fire from the sidelines, we have always been playing a positive role in achieving peace”.\\n\\nEarlier in the day, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who took part in a trilateral meeting with the two national leaders, said that “more effort is needed to curtail delivery of dual-use goods to Russia that find their way to the battlefield”.\\nOn trade issues, Macron also appeared to gain some ground with Xi. In a nod to a developing dispute, he gave Xi two bottles of cognac, one Louis XIII by Remy Martin and one Hennessy X.O, and thanked him for his “open attitude” towards Beijing’s trade probe into the premium liquor’s exports to China.\\nBeijing’s anti-dumping investigation is seen to be in response to a European Union inquiry into subsidies in China’s electric vehicle sector, a probe Macron strongly supports.\\n“I thank the president for his open attitude regarding provisional measures on cognac,” Macron said, as the leaders made statements in front of the press, during the first day of Xi’s first European state visit in five years.\\nMacron also gave Xi a copy of the first French-Chinese dictionary and rare Victor Hugo volumes. He received in return a stuffed bird, a painting and some French-language books that were published in China.\\n\\n\\nThe exchanges happened at a tense moment for EU-China trade relations, with some speculating that the powers were teetering on the brink of a trade war.\\nEuropean leaders have railed against what they describe as “overcapacity” in China’s manufacturing sector. They believe there is not enough demand in China to absorb the volume of hi-tech goods being made there, and that these goods will be exported to the bloc en masse at discount prices, endangering local producers.\\nVon der Leyen warned that “Europe will not waver from making tough decisions needed to protect its economy and its security”, adding that Brussels was willing to use the trade weapons at its disposal to counter Beijing’s policies.\\nDuring Monday’s trilateral meeting, Xi rejected these claims, saying “there is no such thing as China’s overcapacity problem”.\\nAs the leaders were raising glasses of Champagne at the start of a state banquet, the Elysee began releasing details of intergovernmental agreements sealed over the course of the day.\\n\\nA 10-point statement was released on the Middle East, just after news broke that Hamas officials had approved a ceasefire deal for Gaza put forward by Qatari and Egyptian mediators. In the statement, Macron and Xi “expressed their opposition to an Israeli offensive on Rafah, which would lead to a humanitarian catastrophe on a new scale”.\\nAn agreement on artificial intelligence “emphasised the importance of strengthening international cooperation in a context of rapid technological development to guarantee international security and stability, sovereignty and respect for fundamental rights”.\\nOn the sidelines of a business conference tied to Xi’s visit, Chinese and French enterprises also announced a series of deals.\\nThese included an agreement between France’s Orano and China’s Xiamen Tungsten New Energy to forge a “global strategic partnership” in the battery industry, and a memorandum of understanding between French company Fives and Chinese firm Envision to cooperate in battery cell assembly in France.\\nBYD and the Chinese auto industry are very welcome in France\\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire\\nA long list of Chinese companies were invited to this part of the summit, including some that have been in the cross hairs of European regulators. Among them were telecoms giants Huawei Technologies and ZTE, and rail equipment provider CRRC.\\nOne notable absentee was BYD, the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer. Earlier in the day, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the country was open to Chinese investment in its electric vehicle sector, including from BYD.\\n“France welcomes all industrial projects. BYD and the Chinese auto industry are very welcome in France,” Le Maire told a gathering of automotive executives.\\nOn trade, China agreed to open its market to French exports of pork offal and processed pork proteins, while the sides agreed to “intensify their exchanges” on opening the Chinese cosmetics markets to French companies, in a nod to a long-standing European economic gripe.\\nFurther declarations were signed on biodiversity and agriculture, while a flurry of cultural exchanges were agreed to. In one such deal, China Media Group, the state-owned parent company of broadcaster CGTN, has “become a major partner” of the Sunny Side of the Doc, an annual documentary film festival in the French town of La Rochelle.\\n",

    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — American Lithium Corp. (“American Lithium” or the “Company”) (TSX-V:LI | OTCQX:AMLIF | Frankfurt:5LA1) is pleased to announce an updated Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) for the Tonopah Lithium Claims (“TLC”) project, located in the Esmerelda lithium district northwest of Tonopah, Nevada. The updated MRE has successfully converted Indicated Resources to the Measured category, increasing Measured Resources 47% from the previous 2023 MRE at TLC. The resource block model has been further refined, increasing the confidence of the TLC resource. The vast majority of resources used in the 2024 PEA Mine Plan are now within the more reliable Measured Resource footprint.\nThe updated MRE was completed by Stantec Consulting Services Inc. of Salt Lake City, UT and is based on an additional 44 drill holes drilled since the previously filed January 2023 MRE.\nHighlights: (see Table 1 February 2025 TLC MRE & Table 2 Previous January 2023 TLC MRE, below)\nLink to: Figure 1 – TLC Project Updated Mineral Resource Block Outline and Drill Hole Location Map (also see below)\n- Measured Resource – 6.17 Mt Lithium Carbonate Equivalent (“LCE”) (1,365 Mt @ 849 ppm Li); increase of 47% contained LCE versus 2023 MRE\n- Indicated Resource – 2.39 Mt LCE (553 Mt @ 808 ppm Li); decrease of 48% versus 2023 MRE\n- Measured + Indicated Resource – 8.56 Mt LCE (1,918 Mt @ 839 ppm Li); 3% decrease from 2023 MRE\n- Inferred Resource – 1.44 Mt LCE (345 Mt @ 780 ppm Li); 22% decrease from 2023 MRE\nAmerican Lithium Interim CEO, Alex Tsakumis states: “We are very pleased with the newly established and upgraded Measured Resource footprint at TLC as it not only increases the resource confidence level in the Measured category but also represents the core of the 2024 PEA Mine Plan. Our focus remains on diligently and prudently advancing our projects as we prepare for an anticipated recovery in the battery metals market.”\nTable 1 – Updated TLC Mineral Resource Estimate (February 2025)\n- CIM definitions are followed for classification of Mineral Resource.\n- Mineral Resource surface pit extent has been estimated using a lithium carbonate price of US20,000 US$/tonne and mining cost of US$3.00 per tonne, a lithium recovery of 90%, fixed density of 1.70 g/cm3 (1.43 tons/yd3)\n- Conversions: 1 metric tonne = 1.102 short tons, metric m3 = 1.308 yd3, Li2CO3:Li ratio = 5.32, LiOH.H2O:Li ratio =6.05\n- Totals may not represent the sum of the parts due to rounding.\n- The Mineral Resource estimate has been prepared by Joan Kester, PG of Stantec Consulting Services Inc. in conformity with CIM “Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices” guidelines and are reported in accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators NI 43-101.

Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that any mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserve.\nFigure 1 – TLC Project Updated Mineral Resource Block Outline and Drill Hole Location Map\nMineral Resource Estimation Calculation Methodology\nThe geologic model used for reporting of lithium resources was developed using Hexagon Mining’s geological modelling and mine planning software, MinePlan version 16.1.1. The geologic model from which lithium resources are reported is a 3D block model developed using the Nevada State Plane Central Zone NAD83 coordinate system and U.S. customary units. Block size is 50ft-X, 50ft-Y and 20ft-Z. Modeling method and approach is similar to that described in the prior Technical Report (Loveday and Kester, 2023) but with a re-interpretation of geologic controls on mineralization using the additional exploration drilling and geophysical data.A base case lithium resource cut-off grade has been calculated based on the economics of a medium size (100 Mtpa) run-of-mine (ROM) surface mining operation that does not require blasting. Processing of the mineralized material would be onsite extracting lithium from claystone using an acid digestion method. Resources are reported from within an economic pit shell at 45-degree constant slope using Hexagon mining Pseudoflow algorithm. Maximum pit depth is limited to 1,000 feet (304.8 m) below surface. No underground mining is considered.\nThe following mining, processing, royalty, and recovery costs, in US$, were used to derive a base case cut-off grade to produce a lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) equivalent product:\n- Mining costs US$3/tonne;\n- Processing costs US$49/tonne;\n- Royalties US$1/tonne;\n- General and administration US$1/tonne; and Processing recovery 90%.\nRevenue from a lithium carbonate product is estimated to be US$20,000/tonne for the cutoff grade calculation. Using the above inputs and Li2CO3:Li ratio of 5.32, a base case cut-off grade for lithium is estimated to be 500 ppm, rounded from 501 ppm. The base case cut-off grade of 500 ppm lithium is the same as the prior (Loveday and Kester, 2023) Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) using the same cost assumptions as the prior MRE.\nThe updated base case MRE represents an increase of 47% Li2CO3 equivalent tonnes in the Measured Category, a decrease of 48% for the Indicated category when compared to the prior MRE (both at 500 ppm Li cutoff). Inferred Li2CO3 equivalent resources have decreased by 22% percent when compared to the prior MRE for the base case.\nResource Estimate Parameters:\n- Resource Update Effective Date – February 7, 2023:\n- 44 new drill holes (2022 to 2023) added to current MRE (16 RC and 28 Diamond)\n- 82 drill holes (2019 to 2022 in previous MRE)\n- Resource Update Effective Date – February 7, 2023:\n- 44 new drill holes (2022 to 2023) added to current MRE (16 RC and 28 Diamond)\n- 82 drill holes (2019 to 2022 in previous MRE)\nQuality Assurance, Quality Control and Data Verification\nDiamond drilling was conducted by First Drilling of Montrose, Colorado using large diameter, PQ-size, drilling entirely vertical holes in 2022. In 2023 eight (8) additional diamond cores were drilled by IG Drilling\nof Payson, Utah using drill rig CS-14 using either a PQ or HQ diameter drill bit. Drill core samples are nominally 5-foot (1.53 m) length and are cut longitudinally, and one half of the HQ-size core, or one quarter of PQ size core is placed in sealed bags and shipped to analytical laboratories.Reverse Circulation (RC) drilling was conducted by Harris Exploration Drilling and Associates Inc., of Fallon, Nevada with 5.5-inch diameter face centred bit on vertical drill holes. Sampling was conducted using a riffle splitter or a cyclone splitter depending on the moisture content of the sampled material. Sampling was conducted over 5-foot (1.52m) intervals with individual samples placed in sealed bags and transported to the respective analytical labs. In 2023 three (3) RC holes were\ndrilled by Harris’s Canterra Rig using 5.5” diameter.Samples were shipped to American Assay Laboratories (AAL) in Sparks, Nevada for sample preparation, processing and ICP-MS multi-element analysis.

Although American Lithium believes that the current opinions and expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable based on information available at the time, undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements since American Lithium can provide no assurance that such opinions and expectations will prove to be correct. All forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and subject to a variety of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, including risks, uncertainties and assumptions related to: American Lithium’s ability to achieve its stated goals;, which could have a material adverse impact on many aspects of American Lithium’s businesses including but not limited to: the ability to access mineral properties for indeterminate amounts of time, the health of the employees or consultants resulting in delays or diminished capacity, social or political instability in Peru which in turn could impact American Lithium’s ability to maintain the continuity of its business operating requirements, may result in the reduced availability or failures of various local administration and critical infrastructure, reduced demand for the American Lithium’s potential products, availability of materials, global travel restrictions, and the availability of insurance and the associated costs; the ongoing ability to work cooperatively with stakeholders, including but not limited to local communities and all levels of government; the potential for delays in exploration or development activities; the interpretation of drill results, the geology, grade and continuity of mineral deposits; the possibility that any future exploration, development or mining results will not be consistent with our expectations; risks that permits will not be obtained as planned or delays in obtaining permits; mining and development risks, including risks related to accidents, equipment breakdowns, labour disputes (including work stoppages, strikes and loss of personnel) or other unanticipated difficulties with or interruptions in exploration and development; risks related to commodity price and foreign exchange rate fluctuations; risks related to foreign operations; the cyclical nature of the industry in which American Lithium operates; risks related to failure to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis and on acceptable terms or delays in obtaining governmental approvals; risks related to environmental regulation and liability; political and regulatory risks associated with mining and exploration; risks related to the uncertain global economic environment and the effects upon the global market generally, any of which could continue to negatively affect global financial markets, including the trading price of American Lithium’s shares and could negatively affect American Lithium’s ability to raise capital and may also result in additional and unknown risks or liabilities to American Lithium. Other risks and uncertainties related to prospects, properties and business strategy of American Lithium are identified in the “Risk Factors” section of American Lithium’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis filed on October 15, 2024, and in recent securities filings available atwww.sedarplus.ca.

American Lithium undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements except as required by applicable securities laws. Investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.Cautionary Note Regarding 32 Concessions\nThirty-two of the one-hundred-seventy-four concessions comprising the Falchani and Macusani Projects are currently subject to Administrative and Judicial processes in Peru to overturn resolutions issued by INGEMMET and the Mining Council of MINEM in February 2019 and July 2019, respectively, which declared title to thirty-two concessions invalid due to late receipt of the annual validity payments. On November 2, 2021, American Lithium was awarded a favorable ruling in regard to title to the concessions, but on November 26, 2021, appeals of the judicial ruling were lodged by INGEMMET and MINEM. A three-judge tribunal of Peru’s Superior Court unanimously upheld the ruling in a decision reported in November 2023. American Lithium was subsequently notified that INGEMMET and MINEM have filed petitions to the Supreme Court of Peru to assume jurisdiction in the proceedings. Given the precedent of the original ruling it is hoped that the Supreme Court will not assume jurisdiction; however, there is no assurance of the outcome at this time.\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/3fae412c-f633-4c9b-80cb-9b9afad01492",

    "title": "Exclusive: Biden tells Muir he wouldn't pardon son Hunter, says Trump got 'fair trial'",
    "text": "President Biden is in Normandy commemorating the 80th anniversary of D-Day. President Joe Biden said he would not pardon his son Hunter amid an ongoing felony gun trial during a wide-ranging exclusive interview with ABC News anchor David Muir at the Normandy American Cemetery on the 80th anniversary of D-Day. Muir asked Biden on Thursday if he would accept the outcome of his son's trial in Wilmington, Delaware, to which the president said, \"Yes.\" Biden also said \"yes\" when asked by Muir if he would rule out a pardon for Hunter. Hunter Biden, the president's only surviving son, is on trial in Delaware on three felony charges related to his efforts to obtain a firearm in 2018 while allegedly addicted to drugs. It's a historic trial, as no son of a sitting president has faced a criminal trial before. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty last October after being indicted by special counsel David Weiss. For more from Muir's interview with President Biden, watch ABC's \"World News Tonight with David Muir\" at 6:30 p.m. ET. During the interview with Muir in Normandy, France, the president also touched on opponent Donald Trump's own historic trial, after Trump became the first former president to be convicted on felony charges. Trump, convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records, has baselessly called his guilty verdict a politically motivated witch hunt. Biden accused Trump of seeking to undermine the rule of law. \"He's trying to undermine it,\" Biden told Muir. \"He got a fair trial. The jury spoke.\" MORE | Exclusive: Biden tells ABC's David Muir US weapons will not be used to strike Moscow, Kremlin Biden also addressed his new executive action to close the border to asylum seekers between official points of entry. It came months after Republicans in Congress killed a bipartisan border security deal at the behest of former President Trump. \"Do you wish you had done it sooner?\" Muir asked Biden. \"No,\" Biden said. The president also talked with Muir about Israel's military operations against Hamas in Gaza, of which he has grown increasingly critical. Biden has called on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to credibly consider the safety of civilians in the southern Gazan town of Rafah. \"I think he's listening to me,\" Biden said of Netanyahu.",
