    "text": "I decided to participate in the Challenge because at one point I didn’t feel motivated or encouraged to do new things or everyday activities. I wasn’t taking care of myself physically or mentally. Since I have been participating in the Thrive Challenge, I have seen great changes in myself. I decided to go to bed earlier every night so I could rest better. I leave my phone on Do Not Disturb mode and it has worked for me. I’m going to bed earlier, and thanks to that, I can perform much better at work and I don’t feel as exhausted as before. In the morning, I eat a good breakfast with vegetables. For lunch, I eat salmon, salad, or mashed potatoes. At night, I drink sugar-free fruit smoothies. Before the Challenge, I ate a lot of rice, pizza, and hamburgers. Thanks to those changes, I have improved a lot. I have incorporated movement, like walking for a few minutes to start and then running. I also started playing softball and I always do that in the mornings when I get up. That helps relieve my stress. During the day, my wife and I make time to talk about how our day went. If it went badly for us, we encourage each other. The same applies to my daughter. If she had a negative day, we talk to her with a lot of positivity to help her and have a good mood. It is very important to always help others who need advice. If I see a sad friend or family member, I always talk to them to cheer them up. I’m saving because I’ve stopped spending money on unnecessary things. Thanks to small adjustments, I can have a better quality of life. My experience with the Challenge has been very good, and my wife and daughter are happier with me. They tell me that now they always see me in good spirits and I’m always smiling, and they love that. At that moment I realized that the Challenge works, and that motivated me to continue doing the Challenge day after day. Thanks to the Challenge I am a happier person, I sleep better, I eat healthier, I share more with my family, and I arrive at work in a better mood. Thanks to those changes I am a better person. — Darvin Dominguez, Walmart Supercenter #2302, Barceloneta, PR; $5K Winner",

    "text": "SIDON, Lebanon — Ahmad Ghaddar couldn’t sleep. He was sitting on a seaside railing, alternating drags of his cigarette and sips of coffee.\nIt had only been a day since his neighbor in their town of Ghaziah got a phone call from the Israeli army warning residents to evacuate. It seemed like so much longer.\nGhaddar already knew the destructive power of Israeli missiles — he’d seen one hit a building near his home — so he bundled his parents and siblings in the car (“They were eight of us. We could barely breathe,” he said) and drove to his aunt’s place in nearby Sidon.\nAdvertisement “When we were driving, we heard blasts from every direction,” he said. “It was like a video game.”\nThey had joined the deluge of what authorities estimate are half a million Lebanese displaced by the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah , fleeing Israeli strikes that health authorities say have killed more than 700 people this week.\nHis aunt’s place was the best option, since every hotel, mosque and school-turned-shelter in Sidon was already filled with other displaced families. But in his aunt’s home, with her brother’s family also staying there, 23 people were packed into the same apartment.\nAdvertisement\nWorld & Nation\nNews Analysis: An imperiled Hezbollah faces the prospect of all-out war with Israel Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militant group backed by Iran, appears to have hit the lowest point in its more than 40-year history.\nSept. 24, 2024\n“I just couldn’t think, couldn’t move, couldn’t even go to the bathroom,” Ghaddar said. He also couldn’t sleep so he went outside, and spent the night walking back and forth on Sidon’s promenade, the sea castle built by crusaders in the 13th century in the background.\nThat’s where 21-year-old Ghaddar remained on a recent morning, and where he had made the decision: He was going back to Ghaziah and staying there, come what may.\n“At least I’ll sleep in my bed. Go to my own bathroom. Maybe even light up an arghileh [water pipe],” he said, a faint smile crinkling his face.\nWorld & Nation\nIsraeli barrage kills nearly 500 people in Lebanon Israel said it hit more than 1,110 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. Lebanese officials said 492 people were killed.\nSept. 23, 2024\nA friend sitting by him started off discouraging him, telling him he should stay with his family and not put himself in danger. But Ghaddar countered with some gallows humor.\nAdvertisement “Man, my roof is made from straw. I’m not a fighter — they can see everything I do anyway,” he said, referring to Israeli drones.\nHis friend Abbas, who gave only his first name over fears of backlash for speaking to Western media, played along.\n“Yeah, I guess so. Besides, why would they bother sending a million-dollar missile for your house?”\nBoth laughed before turning to a man sleeping on the ground nearby, swathed in whatever items of clothing he had salvaged from his home.\nWorld & Nation\nWhat is the Iran-backed ‘Axis of Resistance’ and what does it mean for Israel? Here’s a look at the so-called Axis of Resistance, an Iran-backed coalition including Hezbollah, Hamas and other militant groups devoted to destroying Israel.\nSept. 26, 2024\n“He’s been here since the first day of the attacks, just sleeping in the sun,” Ghaddar said.\nThe Lebanese militant group Hezbollah began lobbing rockets into northern Israel last October in what it says is a solidarity campaign with Palestinians in Gaza. By this month, the fighting had already driven 90,000 people from their homes in Lebanon and 60,000 in northern Israel. Israel’s escalation has killed hundreds of people, injured thousands and displaced an estimated 500,000, Lebanese authorities say.\nAdvertisement Some — more than 30,000 Syrian or Lebanese citizens — have fled into war-torn Syria, authorities say, a stunning turn considering Lebanon is still hosting hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees who fled that country’s ongoing civil war. But most of the displaced in Lebanon are looking for shelter within their country.\nThough the government, NGOs, political parties and private volunteer groups have set up hundreds of shelters across Lebanon, the magnitude of the crisis is already proving too much for a country suffering through a multiyear political crisis.\nMany of the shelters are plagued by lack of maintenance, ill-equipped to handle large numbers of evacuees. Many don’t have enough mattresses, bedding or food.\n“Every time they distribute aid, they go up floor by floor and by the time they get to us it’s finished,” said Reham Fadlallah, a 21-year-old beauty salon stylist from the Dahieh, the Hezbollah-dominated southern suburbs of Beirut . “Then they repeat the same thing, so we get nothing.”\nPolitics\nIsrael strikes Beirut suburb as conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon intensifies Days after the attacks on Hezbollah with exploding electronic devices across Lebanon, Israel has struck a suburb of Beirut, killing a top commander.\nSept. 20, 2024\nShe and her aunt came to a hotel management institute turned shelter in the Dekawneh neighborhood of Beirut on Tuesday, after finding it through a combination of word-of-mouth and WhatsApp groups. There were no fans to help with Beirut’s still-sweltering weather, and no running water.\n“I can’t believe it. We’ve been shouting since yesterday for this,” Fadlallah said to a passing volunteer.\nAdvertisement “We can’t find a plumber — sorry,” the volunteer responded, walking briskly past.\nUnlike Ghaddar, Fadlallah couldn’t go back home. Living in Dahieh, among Hezbollah officials, administrators and possibly even fighters, meant the area was a target. The day before, a neighbor had told her their building was going to be hit — and it was, just as she was leaving with her aunt, Nadia.\nFadlallah couldn’t easily find a place to rent. Prices were already skyrocketing, and many Lebanese, fearing Israeli airstrikes targeting Hezbollah officials, were reluctant to rent out apartments to people from those areas.\nAnd other shelters were full so for now she stayed, hoping for rest and some running water.\n“I just want to shower,” Fadlallah said.\nWorld & Nation\nHundreds of pagers mysteriously explode in Lebanon; Hezbollah blames Israel Thousands of people were wounded across Lebanon in what was thought to be a cyberattack causing pagers carried by Hezbollah members to explode.\nSept. 17, 2024\nMore to Read\nIsrael expands bombardment in Lebanon as thousands flee; more deadly strikes in Gaza Oct. 5, 2024\nChristian villages were neutral in the Israel-Hezbollah conflict.

    "text": "A 2023 study published in Journal of Happiness Studies found that “strengths scanning” or recognizing a partner's character strengths, such as their bravery, creativity, open-mindedness or kindness, can improve the quality and happiness experienced in a romantic relationship.\nStrengths scanning involves trusting the best in a partner and focusing on what they do right rather than waiting for them to do something wrong. Researchers suggest that actively acknowledging and appreciating these strengths goes a long way in maintaining a healthy, long-term bond.\nHere are two ways strengths scanning helps you bring out the best in your relationship.\n1. It promotes positive illusion in the relationship\nPositive illusions in a relationship refer to seeing your partner in an overly positive light, often more positively than you see yourself, and emphasizing their strengths, qualities, and admirable characteristics while maintaining a positive bias toward the idea of a successful future with them. have to give.\nThese positive illusions are generally considered healthy for relationships because they contribute to increased satisfaction and lower levels of conflict by promoting a more favorable attitude toward one's partner and the relationship as a whole. However, a balance between these positive illusions and a realistic understanding of one's partner can co-exist and is necessary to keep relationships fulfilling.\nExamining a partner's strengths in everyday interactions can reinforce these realistic positive illusions of their character. For example, when your partner talks about their workday, you may notice that they maintain great work-life boundaries, even when they have a heavy workload. “Scanning” their powers would mean reflecting on what it is about their character or their abilities that allows them to do so. This reflection can promote the realistic and positive illusion that they are highly organized, assertive, and confident.\nAccording to a 2019 study, positive illusions provide a sense of security and a willingness to invest in the relationship, helping partners deal with relationship challenges and treat each other's shortcomings with more kindness and understanding. .\n2. It increases mutual happiness\nStrengths scanning benefits yourself, your partner, and the longevity of the relationship. Research shows that when a person's strengths are valued, they experience greater well-being. Incorporating higher levels of character strengths is also linked to greater marital satisfaction for both partners.\nAccording to a 2018 study, displaying a higher level of appreciation for a partner's strengths is linked to experiencing greater commitment, investment, and intimacy. This allows individuals to view their relationships as a place of personal growth, where they feel supported in achieving their life goals. On the other hand, focusing on the negative side of a partner's qualities, such as the tendency to spread oneself too thin when providing emotional support, is associated with lower relationship satisfaction.\nResearchers found that acknowledging a partner's strengths can shape their behavior and also allow them to experience better well-being and personal growth. This works to boost their confidence and self-worth, develop a culture of praise and provide them with feedback on which behaviors to continue or eliminate.\nStrengths scanning can also increase “partner perceived responsiveness”, which measures how understanding, validating, and supportive a partner is perceived to be, and significantly improve relationship satisfaction. Seeking out a partner's strengths can make a person more attuned to their level of responsiveness and caring behavior as well as make them more appreciative and supportive of their partners.\nHow to Use Strengths Scanning in a Relationship\nHere are three ways to start accepting a partner's strengths.\n- Engage in active observation. Pay attention to your partner's actions, behavior, and accomplishments in everyday scenarios and consider what these examples reveal about their character. For example, even a small moment like a colleague bringing you a cup of coffee before work demonstrates strength of character by being loving and considerate.\n- Express gratitude often. Verbalize your appreciation of their strengths. Celebrate their accomplishments, no matter how small. This shows appreciation of their efforts and abilities. A heartfelt “Thank you for doing that” or “You're amazing at that” can go a long way in reinforcing positive gestures.\n- Encourage their development. Support your partner in his/her personal growth and advancement efforts. Encouraging them to engage in efforts that build and showcase their strengths is the key to creating a positive cycle of strength scanning and genuine praise.\nconclusion\nWhen both partners actively highlight each other's strengths, it creates an environment where each person feels seen and celebrated. Recognizing and accepting a partner's strengths strengthens the foundation of the relationship, fostering a deeper, more loving connection, effective communication, and mutual growth.\nIf you're curious to know your current level of relationship satisfaction, take this test: relationship satisfaction scale\nSource: www.forbes.com",
