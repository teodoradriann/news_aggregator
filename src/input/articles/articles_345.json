    "text": "Virat Kohli falls for 6 in Ranji Trophy comeback, fans disappointed\nNew Delhi [India], January 31 (ANI): Virat Kohli's much-anticipated return to the Ranji Trophy was short-lived, as he was dismissed for just six runs by Himanshu Sangwan on Friday at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi.\nKohli showed a glimpse of his brilliance with a beautiful straight drive off Sangwan just a ball before his dismissal. However, the very next delivery proved fatal--angled in on a fullish length just outside off, the ball seamed in sharply as Kohli attempted a drive but left a gap between bat and pad. The delivery rushed through, clipping the off-stump and sending the bails flying. It was a moment to remember for Sangwan, who not only claimed the prized wicket but also saw the stadium empty out soon after.\nKohli's brief stay at the crease lasted just 15 deliveries, with a solitary boundary to his name. His dismissal left Delhi at 87/3, still trailing Railways by 140 runs.\nFor the thousands of fans who had flocked to the stadium hoping for a Kohli masterclass, it was a moment of disappointment. However, there remains a chance for redemption--should Delhi get a second innings, Kohli will have another opportunity to make his mark.\nThe Delhi stadium was buzzing and filled with excitement on Day 1, a sight not common for domestic cricket matches, with fans awaiting action from their hero whose recent performances have been mostly disappointing. Some additional gates were opened to accommodate fans and additional security deployed. As per ESPNCricinfo, over 15,000 fans attended the match.\nThe Group D clash also saw a fan breaching security as he rushed onto the field to meet Virat Kohli. With Delhi's opening bowlers, Navdeep Saini and Siddhant Sharma, having Railways in trouble at 21/3, the person managed to evade security and reach Kohli and touched his feet. Security personnel quickly intervened and escorted the intruder off the field. Kohli requested them to go easy on the fan and avoid any harsh treatment.

    "text": "November 21, 2023\nReview Recipe\nThese copycat Chick Fil A nuggets are here to satisfy your cravings for that iconic fast-food flavor. These juicy, golden, crunchy bites are the ultimate comfort food that will have you craving more.\nYou’ll need a handful of simple ingredients to make these tasty nuggets. A buttermilk marinade that includes pickle juice, the secret to that signature Chick Fil A tang, starts the process.\nOnce marinated, you will coat the chicken with a breadcrumb mixture that creates a perfectly crispy coating once fried.\nYou’ll need:\nBUTTERMILK: If you don’t have buttermilk on hand, you can use regular milk with a tablespoon of lemon juice or white vinegar as a substitute.\nCHICKEN: Feel free to use chicken thighs if you prefer dark meat, or even try it with tofu for a vegetarian version.\nFLOUR: You can opt for whole wheat flour for a slightly different texture in this chicken nuggets recipe.\nPAPRIKA: Experiment with smoked or sweet paprika for unique flavor variations.\nLet’s walk through the steps for making this easy and delicious chicken nugget recipe.\nSTEP ONE: Whisk together the buttermilk, pickle juice, and egg.\nSTEP TWO: Place the chicken pieces in a gallon-size ziplock or a medium-sized bowl (2-3 quarts). Pour the marinade over the chicken.\nIf you use a ziplock, remove as much excess air as possible, seal the baggie, and “massage” the chicken and marinade.\nIf you are using the bowl, tightly cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Chill the chicken and marinade in the refrigerator for at least one hour.\nOUR RECIPE DEVELOPER SAYS\nMarinating the chicken in buttermilk and pickle juice is crucial for flavor and tenderness. Aim for the full hour, or even a bit longer if possible, to maximize the taste.\nSTEP THREE: While the chicken is marinating, combine flour, bread crumbs, powdered sugar, cornstarch, kosher salt, baking powder, paprika, and black pepper in a medium bowl or gallon-size ziplock.\nCover the bowl with plastic wrap, or seal the ziplock baggie and set it aside.\nSTEP FOUR: Just before you are ready to cook your chicken nuggets, add the four cups of oil to a deep-sided 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Heat the oil to 350°F.\nPRO TIP:\nUse a deep-fry thermometer to keep a close eye on the temperature, and adjust the stove top temperature up or down accordingly.\nSTEP FIVE: Remove the marinated chicken from the refrigerator. Drain off the marinade.\nSTEP SIX: Line a 9×13 (or 13×9) baking dish with paper towels.\nSTEP SEVEN: Dredge the chicken in the breading mixture. Place the coated chicken on a plate or baking dish.\nSTEP EIGHT: When frying the chicken nuggets, you will need to work in batches.\nPlace the first batch of chicken nuggets into the hot oil and cook for about 2-2½ minutes per side until golden brown.\nBe sure to adjust the stove top temperature up or down to keep the oil temperature at 350°F. Once all of the chicken nuggets are cooked, serve immediately.\nServe your homemade Chick-Fil-A nuggets with a classic side of waffle fries and a creamy, homemade\nChick Fil A sauce and Chick Fil A lemonade for an authentic fast-food experience.\nCreate a delicious chicken nugget salad by tossing these nuggets with mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, and\nranch dressing.\nMake a kid-friendly meal by pairing these nuggets with\nmacaroni and cheese for a comfort food feast.\nAdd your favorite dipping sauce, such as\nhoney mustard sauce or chicken finger dipping sauce.\nIt’s so much fun to make copycat recipes of your favorite foods right in your own kitchen. Check out our\ncopycat Red Lobster biscuits and copycat Olive Garden salad.\nMORE CHICKEN RECIPES\nWhether you’re planning ahead or have leftovers to preserve, here’s what you need to know:\nMAKE AHEAD: You can marinate the chicken in advance and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours before dredging and frying.\nIN THE FRIDGE: Once cooked, these copycat nuggets can be stored in the fridge for up to two to three days. Reheat in the oven to maintain their crispiness.\nIN THE FREEZER: To freeze, place the cooked and cooled nuggets in an airtight container with parchment paper between layers.\nThey’ll stay good for up to two months. Reheat in the oven or air fryer for that fresh taste.\nREHEATING: To reheat, use an oven at 350°F or an air fryer at 375°F until they’re hot and crispy again.\nAlternatively, the microwave works for convenience, but it may slightly affect the texture.\nAUTHENTIC FLAVOR: These Copycat Chick-fil-A nuggets capture the essence of the original, allowing you to enjoy that beloved taste at home.\nFAMILY FAVORITE: Kids and adults alike adore these nuggets, making them a crowd-pleaser.\nHOMEMADE GOODNESS: There’s something special about making these nuggets from scratch that adds to the overall enjoyment.\nOur Copycat Chick Fil A nuggets bring the iconic fast-food flavor right to your kitchen. Whether you’re serving them at a casual gathering or movie night, these nuggets are sure to delight with their authentic taste and ease of preparation.\nClassic Chick Fil A sauce, honey mustard, barbecue sauce, or ranch are great choices.\nAdd some cayenne pepper or hot sauce to the marinade or the flour mixture for a spicy kick.\nCanola or vegetable oil works best for this recipe, but you can use peanut oil for a slightly different flavor.\nMarinating imparts flavor, but if you’re short on time, you can marinate for at least 30 minutes.\nYes, you can! Preheat the air fryer to 400°F and cook the nuggets for about 10-12 minutes, flipping halfway through.",

    "text": "[Écrit par AFP] Le puissant typhon Kong-rey, l'un des plus forts que Taïwan ait connu ces dernières années, a touché terre à la mi-journée à Chenggong (sud-est), et a déjà entraîné la mort d'au moins une personne et fait 73 blessés, selon un premier bilan des autorités. Le typhon, accompagné de bourrasques atteignant 184 km/h et de pluies torrentielles, a touché terre à environ 13H40 locales (5H40 GMT) au sud-est de l'île, la partie la moins peuplée de cette île de 23 millions d'habitants déjà en proie à la mousson, et où de nombreuses personnes ont déjà été évacuées. La victime est une femme de 56 ans, morte après la chute d'un arbre déraciné sur son véhicule, dans le comté de Nantou (centre), a déclaré l'agence. Avant même l'arrivée de la tempête, des vagues de dix mètres de haut ont été observées et au moins 27 personnes ont été blessées par les intempéries, notamment à la suite de coulées de boue, a déclaré l'Agence nationale des incendies. A l'origine décrit comme le plus puissant des typhons de l'année, Kong-rey affiche désormais la même intensité que le typhon Gaemi, la plus forte tempête à avoir frappé Taïwan ces huit dernières années, au moment de son arrivée en juillet. Avec un rayon de 320 kilomètres, Kong-rey est considéré comme le plus étendu à toucher terre depuis près de 30 ans. - Ecoles et bureaux fermés - Jeudi, écoles et bureaux ont été fermés dans tout Taïwan, les habitants se préparant à affronter la tempête. Le géant taïwanais de la technologie TSMC a déclaré avoir \"activé les procédures habituelles de préparation à l'alerte typhon\" dans ses usines de fabrication de puces et ne pas s'attendre à un \"impact significatif\" sur ses activités. Les rues de Taipei, en proie à de fortes pluies et à des vents violents, sont en grande partie désertes. Plus d'un mètre de pluie pourrait tomber d'ici à vendredi dans les régions les plus touchées. Les prévisionnistes ont mis en garde contre les vents \"destructeurs\" de Kong-rey, et près de 35.000 soldats se tiennent prêts à participer aux opérations de secours. Dès mercredi, des dizaines de liaisons en ferry et de vols intérieurs avaient été annulés et les autorités avaient procédé à des évacuations dans huit comtés et villes, dont Yilan, Hualien et Taitung. - Tardiveté inhabituelle - La tempête devrait s'affaiblir une fois arrivée sur terre et se déplacer vers les montagnes du centre avant de sortir en traversant le détroit de Taïwan, selon Chu Mei-lin, de l'administration centrale de la météorologie, qui a précisé qu'elle devrait \"sévèrement\" affecter l'île jusqu'à vendredi matin. Le ministre de l'Intérieur Liu Shyh-fang a fait part de son inquiétude quant au sort de deux touristes tchèques qui effectuaient une randonnée dans les gorges de Taroko, près de Hualien, injoignables sur leurs téléphones mercredi. Taïwan est habitué aux tempêtes tropicales, fréquentes de juillet à octobre, mais il est \"inhabituel pour un typhon si puissant de frapper l'île aussi tard dans l'année\", note le météorologue Chang Chun-yao. Le changement climatique augmente leur intensité, avec de grandes averses, des crues soudaines et de très fortes rafales de vent, selon les scientifiques. Kong-rey sera le troisième typhon à frapper Taïwan depuis juillet. Cet été, Gaemi a causé la mort de dix personnes et fait des centaines de blessés, provoquant de vastes inondations dans la ville méridionale de Kaohsiung. Ce typhon a été suivi de Krathon, qui a balayé le sud de Taïwan début octobre, accompagné de vents destructeurs, d'inondations et de coulées de boue qui ont fait au moins quatre morts et des centaines de blessés.",

    "title": "Aurora boreale, perché ieri sera si è vista anche in Italia? La tempesta geomagnetica e le conseguenze per la",
    "text": "L'aurora boreale ha illuminato di nuovo i cieli di tutta Italia. Da Milano a Modena, passando per Torino e Ravenna, in moltissimi ieri sera hanno potuto assistere all'incredibile spettacolo di luce annunciato dagli esperti. La tempesta geomagnetica di classe G4 ha infatti avuto effetti, come previsto, anche alle nostre latitudini, lasciando senza fiato tutti gli appassionati del fenomeno. Aurora boreale stasera in Italia? «Ci sono buone probabilità». L'orario migliore per vederla. In arrivo forte tempesta geomagnetica La tempesta geomagnetica L'origine della tempesta geomagnetica che ha colpito la Terra ieri notte si trova nella macchia solare AR 3848, che martedì 8 ottobre ha prodotto un forte brillamento solare di classe X 1.8: i brillamenti di classe X sono quelli più potenti e quest'ultimo ha infatti innescato blackout radio nelle zone del nostro pianeta in quel momento rivolte verso il Sole. Il brillamento è stato accompagnato da un'espulsione di massa coronale, la cosiddetta Cme, cioè un'espulsione di materia sotto forma di plasma, che si sta ora dirigendo verso la Terra ad una velocità compresa tra 4,3 e 4,7 milioni di chilometri orari. «Tra l'altro, il giorno successivo è stata emessa anche un'altra Cme che potrebbe presto raggiungere la Terra - afferma Messerotti - ma la situazione è ancora da valutare». C'è incertezza anche attorno all'esatto momento di arrivo dell'attuale tempesta geomagnetica: informazioni più accurate saranno, ovviamente, possibili col passare delle ore, ma le previsioni indicano più probabile la tarda giornata del 10 ottobre, con i relativi effetti che dovrebbero persistere fino a quella successiva. Le conseguenze Queste tempeste non sono solo causa di belle luci. «Siamo molto più dipendenti dal punto di vista tecnologico ora di quanto lo fossimo anche durante l’ultima grande tempesta del 2003. Molti dei nostri servizi provengono dallo spazio – non ce ne rendiamo nemmeno conto – è il collante che tiene insieme gran parte della nostra economia», ha spiegato alla BBC Ian Muirhead, ricercatore di sistemi spaziali presso l'Università di Manchester. Qualche tempo fa, dopo un'altra tempesta geomagnetica, il proprietario di SpaceX, Elon Musk, aveva dichiarato su X, che la tempesta aveva messo i suoi satelliti Starlink che forniscono Internet «sotto forte pressione». Un portavoce dell'Agenzia spaziale europea (ESA) aveva affermato che gli Starlink presentavano picchi di tensione. Anche i satelliti su cui facciamo affidamento per il GPS e la navigazione presentavano disturbi del segnale poiché la radiazione extra pulsava verso la Terra, aveva affermato l’ESA. Un volo da San Francisco a Parigi era poi stato deviato per evitare di sorvolare l'Artico, dove le radiazioni erano più forti, aveva spiegato il dottor Elvidge. Aurora boreale, cos'è Tra gli eventi più affascinanti per l'uomo per via dei suoi colori che illuminano i cieli notturni, l'aurora polare è un fenomeno caratterizzato visivamente da bande luminose che assumono un'ampia gamma di forme e colori, rapidamente mutevoli nel tempo e nello spazio, di solito di colore rosso-verde-azzurro, causato dall'interazione di particelle cariche (protoni ed elettroni) di origine solare (vento solare) con la ionosfera terrestre (atmosfera tra i 100-500 km): tali particelle eccitano gli atomi dell'atmosfera che diseccitandosi in seguito emettono luce di varie lunghezze d'onda. A seconda di dove si verifica il fenomeno, quest'ultimo prende nomi diversi: viene denominata aurora boreale qualora si verifichi nell'emisfero nord (boreale), mentre aurora australe qualora si verifichi nell'emisfero sud (australe). Perché siamo riusciti a vederla in Italia Secondo gli scienzati, il fenomeno delle aurore polari è generalmente visibile a latitudini elevate, soprattutto nelle zone del Circolo Popolare Artico. Ma per quale motivo allora ieri siamo riusciti a vederlo anche in Italia? Come spiegato dal Cnr, «in presenza di forte attività solare la quantità di particelle che raggiunge la magnetosfera terrestre è tale che occasionalmente la \\\"tempesta magnetica\\\" può raggiungere anche le medie latitudini, e in situazioni di eccezionale attività del Sole l’Aurora può arrivare ai confini dell’Italia». Secondo alcuni esperti, però, non si tratterebbe della vera aurora boreale, bensì del fenomeno dei Sar o del Steve, a seguito di una tempesta solare. I Sar sono un fenomeno noto anche come «archi di luce rossa», che compaiono, appunto, durante le forti tempeste geomagnetiche. Il fascio di luce viola è invece attribuibile al fenomeno Steve. Il fenomeno, secondo gli esperti, potrebbe persistere per tutto il fine settimana.",
