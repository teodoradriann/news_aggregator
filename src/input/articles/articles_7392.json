Officers found her unconscious and she appeared to be bleeding from her head, the news outlet reported. Her dog stayed at her side.\nThe victim was taken to the hospital where she died a day later on Christmas from her injuries, KTLA reported.\nThe sheriff’s department only identified the victim as an Asian woman between the ages of 60 and 65, according to the Los Angeles Times.\nInvestigators identified the suspect through surveillance footage as Jeffrey Davis, 40, according to KTLA.\n“The person that we had an idea of who was on the security footage is, we believe, a homeless person we’ve had contact with before,” said Sgt. Francisco Esqueda of El Camino College Police, according to the news outlet. “So we were able to go to the neighboring county park where he sometimes hangs out and that’s where we found him.”\nDavis was arrested shortly after the incident, the LA Times reported.\nLatest trending news: Maine’s top election officials removes Trump from 2024 ballot ‘Holiday habits’: YETI recycling Christmas trees, turning them into fish habitats Medical examiner releases cause of death for pregnant teen, boyfriend in Texas Recall alert: BlendJet recalls around 4.8 million portable blenders due to fire, laceration hazards Pierce Brosnan accused of walking in Yellowstone National Park’s thermal areas",
