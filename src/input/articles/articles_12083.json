    "title": "Osage Nation's Victorious War Cry After Judge Rules Wind Farm on Tribal Land Must Be Dismantled: 'This Is Our Homeland'",
    "text": "Opinion\nOsage Nation's Victorious War Cry After Judge Rules Wind Farm on Tribal Land Must Be Dismantled: 'This Is Our Homeland'\nThe Osage Nation in Oklahoma won a great victory for American property rights last week after a judge ordered the dismantling of a renewable energy wind farm that was erected without permission on their tribal lands.\nOne of the main reasons the\nNative American council opposed the wind farm was to protect their mineral rights, not to mention their ability to control their own ancestral homeland.\nBut the battle has been raging in court for a decade already, as the Osage Nation and its Mineral Council worked to eliminate the facilitates of Osage Wind LLC, Enel Kansas LLC and Enel Green Power North America Inc.\nThe victory was total. U.S. Court of International Trade Judge Jennifer Choe-Groves ruled in the case in Tulsa last week that the Osage Nation was awarded injunctive relief via “ejectment of the wind turbine farm for continuing trespass,” according to\nTulsa World.\nThe judge ruled that the\nwind turbine facility constituted “mining” and required a lease from the Osage Nation’s Minerals Council, something the wind farm companies neglected to do when erecting their turbines.\nStop the censors, sign up to get today's top stories delivered right to your inbox\nThe mining ruling was made because the turbine construction crews began extracting tons of rock from the construction site, then crushing it to serve as backfill for their turbines, according to\nThe Energy Mix. The rock extraction was considered “mining,” and that required a lease agreement with the Osage Nation, a requirement to which the wind companies refused to adhere.\nNow, more than 80 wind turbines and their supporting facilities will have to be removed from the Osage lands as the Native group has had its\nproperty rights upheld.\n“The developers failed to acquire a mining lease during or after construction, as well as after issuance of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision holding that a mining lease was required,” Judge Choe-Groves wrote.\n“On the record before the Court, it is clear the Defendants are actively avoiding the leasing requirement,” the judge continued. “Permitting such behavior would create the prospect for future interference with the Osage Mineral Council’s authority by Defendants or others wishing to develop the mineral lease.”\nShe continued, writing, “The Court concludes that Defendants’ past and continued refusal to obtain a lease constitutes interference with the sovereignty of the Osage Nation and is sufficient to constitute irreparable injury.”\nOfficials of the Osage Mineral Council were thrilled — and even a bit shocked — by the ruling. Chairman Everett Waller said, “This is a win not only for the Osage Minerals Council; this is a win for Indian Country.”\nI’d argue it is also a win for American\nhttps://www.westernjournal.com/man-forced-relinquish-100k-beach-property-neighbor-invokes-obscure-law/. This wind energy group moved in and erected their turbines without a never-you-mind from the rightful owners of the property they built on. This is a win for everyone, not just “Indian Country.”\nWaller also lamented having to take such lengths in the first place, saying, “I hope no other tribe has to do what we had to do.”\nHe also made a good point, adding, “There are a lot of smaller tribes that couldn’t have battled this long, but that’s why we’re Osages. We’re here, and this is our homeland, and we are going to protect it at all costs.”\n“Our effort, not only will it protect the production side, but we’re looking at actually protection of our reservation for future generations,” Waller said, The Energy Mix added. “That is really a huge effort.”\nThe case is not quite over, either. Still to be determined is just how much money in damages the energy companies will have to pay the Osage Nation.\n“My legislature, the Osage Congress, has not yet spoken on that, neither has the Minerals Council, but as Chief, I can tell you, my view is—they’ve got to come down,” Osage leader Standing Bear said. “I would like to see damages to us for what we consider not only the cost of the rock but the cost of the trespass.\n“It’s been a cruel disregard for our rights, and it’s got to stop. And if they get off on minimal damages, others will come in and do the same thing,” Standing Bear added.\nIndeed, the Osage Nation is fully federally recognized and since the\n1906 Osage Allotment Act, the Native tribe has had rights to the oil, natural gas and other valuable minerals underneath their lands, as well.\nThese green energy companies clearly violated the law and the Osage Nation’s property rights, and it is well and good that they will be made to pay for that violation. This ruling is a huge win against the ongoing\nencroachment on American private property rights over left-wing green energy folly. Congratulations to the Osage Nation.\nThis article appeared originally on\nThe Western Journal.",

    "text": "The historic arts campus sustained over $1 million in damage, but its team is already working to restore theater spaces and community programs.\nCBS News reports that The Hill Country Arts Foundation in Ingram, Texas, is facing a massive rebuilding effort following deadly flooding that struck the region over the July 4 holiday weekend.\nFounded 66 years ago along the banks of the Guadalupe River, the foundation is home to a theater, art fair, and replica of Stonehenge. For Executive Director Sarah Tacey - who has worked at the site for 25 years - it’s more than a performance venue. “It means something to so many people,” she told CBS News. “People who were out here in their cribs are now directing plays and starring in plays.”\nSeveral facilities on the campus were inundated by floodwaters, including the black box theater, the lobby, and a ceramics studio that had only recently been completed. The outdoor theater’s stage survived thanks to a built-in safeguard: walls intentionally designed to break away in the event of a major flood, preventing the entire structure from being washed downstream.\nDespite the extensive damage - estimated to cost over $1 million to repair - teams are already working to clear debris and restore the site.\n“Everyone at the foundation lost loved ones or knows someone who did,” Tacey said. “The community needs some joy and music and we’ll do it in some fashion and invite the community to come here.”\nThe theater was set to be currently presenting Jimmy Buffett's Escape to Margaritaville through July 26th, 2025. Other summer productions expected to be impacted include Shipwrecked!, Hot Shakespeare, an Evening of One Acts, and Dial M For Murder.\nThe theater was also expected to present A Christmas Carol during the holiday season.\nTo learn more about how you can help and donate, click here.\nVideos",

    "title": "Chiuso l’Auditorium, quadro igienico deficitario. Il provvedimento dell’Asl",
    "text": "Pistoia, 20 dicembre 2024 – La comunicazione da parte dell’ Asl è arrivata in Provincia nella giornata di martedì: per precarie condizioni igienico-sanitarie relative agli spogliatoi, l’ Auditorium di via Panconi deve essere chiuso . Un fulmine (non troppo) a ciel sereno, visto che gli sportivi che frequentano la struttura ne sanno qualcosa: al momento, infatti, era utilizzato al mattino per l’attività scolastica e poi per discipline giovanili ed amatoriali (in particolar modo il basket) nel pomeriggio e alla sera, con le problematiche legate a spogliatoi in condizioni impresentabili. Di tutto questo ne è stata data notizia nel corso dell’ultimo consiglio provinciale da parte del consigliere delegato all’edilizia scolastica, ovvero Gabriele Giacomelli, che ha preannunciato la sospensione di tutta l’attività nel periodo delle festività con l’auspicio di risolvere le problematiche in vista della riapertura delle scuole e della ripartenza delle attività delle società sportive dopo l’Epifania.\nLo stesso presidente della Provincia, Luca Marmo, ha specificato come erano già in ponte cantieri per andare ad ottemperare questo tipo di problematiche che, adesso, verranno gioco forza accelerati. In questa situazione non si è fatto attendere l’attacco della minoranza in consiglio provinciale e non solo. “Aspettavamo da tempo questa chiusura – afferma Matteo Pomposi, presidente Gioventù Nazionale Pistoia – dopo aver lasciato studenti e società sportive allenarsi in una palestra i cui spogliatoi erano in condizioni igieniche vergognose. Se la situazione era conosciuta ormai da tempo ai più, ci chiediamo come mai la Provincia non sia intervenuta prima che lo stabile fosse chiuso da un giorno all’altro. Speriamo che il presidente Marmo e la sua giunta abbiano programmato dove spostare le attività ma temiamo che nulla di tutto ciò sia stato fatto. Un’attenzione allo sport e ai giovani da parte della sinistra pistoiese che passa solo dalle parole e non dai fatti”.\nL’attacco frontale è arrivato anche dal gruppo consiliare di minoranza “Provincia per tutti” con Francesca Capecchi. “Avevamo già sollevato il problema in un’interrogazione alla quale però ci era stato risposto che la Provincia era già intervenuta più volte ma in maniera, evidentemente, insufficiente. E’ necessario che il presidente Marmo e il consigliere Giacomelli facciano chiarezza sulla chiusura, indicando le tempistiche e l’entità dei lavori, sui quali, sfortunatamente, si apre anche la questione della copertura economica, visto che dai documenti del bilancio emerge un quadro critico nel quale è molto difficile operare. Infine, ma non per importanza, chiediamo alla giunta di Marmo di individuare velocemente una sede alternativa per proseguire con le varie attività”.",

Y el Gobierno de Ejpaña tambien debería hacérselo mirar\n#13 pero si ya gobiernan en la región .... ¿Qué les va a dar más votos?¿hacer algo para que los gallegos los vean preocupados y así mantener sus poltronas o no hacer nada? Es que es la hostia, es como la antítesis de todo. Del PP nunca espero grandes alardes, pero están alcanzando cotas de imbecilidad política nunca vistas.\nNi que fuera el presidente a agachar la lomera a recoger trozos de plástico. Ya lo va a hacer algún currito mal pagado. No estamos hablando de tecnología aeroespacial, que es doblar el lomo y limpiar.\nEs para flipar.\nEdito: nada en contra de las personas que trabajan en la limpieza. No se me entienda mal.\n#17 desgraciadamente sí. En la mesa, nada de hablar de política, no vaya a ser que el rojeras del hijo se inflame.\nY hay muchos en esa mesa. Y en las de la familia no tan cercana, muchos más\nY edito más : Creo que algun primo (como mínimo) se lo ha visto por Ferraz. Sí. Créeme. Sí que los conozco.\nLosada parece tener una relación cercana con el BNG, lo cual podría influir en su perspectiva política. Su abordaje irónico del plan de la Xunta podría estar teñido por sus conexiones políticas. Me veo onligado a cuestionar la objetividad de la información y considerar las posibles influencias detrás de estas noticias.\n#20 La xunta tiene un plan que no aplicó y ahora está tratando de resolver esto desde la propaganda y culpando al gobierno del estado cuando la competencia en caso de vertido es de la consellería del Mar.\n#7 El plan existe y funciona; Justo antes de las elecciones se reparten unas ayudas de dinero publico y vuelven a ganar.",

    "text": "\"Prendam-no. Prendam-no. Prendam-no\", gritam os democratas, num comício de Kamala Harris, para Donald Trump. Já ouvimos isso em 2016, quando os apoiantes de Trump exigiam a prisão de Hilary Clinton. É o feitiço a voltar-se contra o feiticeiro. Mas a antiga procuradora da California pede contenção.\n“Esperam. Os tribunais vão tratar disso e nós vamos vencê-los em novembro”, atirou Kamala Harris, a candidata democrata às eleições presidenciais dos Estados Unidos.\nTinha sido Kamala, todavia, a lançar o mote que levou ao grito, quando recuperou a ideia lançada no dia em que Joe Biden desistiu da corrida.\n\"Como procuradora, especializei-me em casos de abuso sexual. Trump foi considerado responsável por cometer abuso sexual. Enquanto procuradora-geral, responsabilizei os grandes bancos de Wall Street por fraude. Bem, Trump acaba de ser considerado culpado por fraude. 34 acusações\".\nDonald Trump não tem feito campanha, mas a candidatura convocou, de surpresa, uma\nconferencia de imprensa do candidato nesta quinta-feira.\n“Se Trump ganhar, vai assinar proibição nacional do aborto”\nA dupla Harris-Walz percorre em passo de corrida os estados decisivos, com a estratégia de desmontar a narrativa de campanha do ex-presidente dos EUA. Esta quarta feira, estiveram de noite no Michigan. Antes, mergulharam no calor do Wisconsin.\nMantendo o foco em Trump, Kamala Harris continua a falar diretamente para as mulheres, grupo onde as sondagens lhe dão vitoria folgada.\n\"Mais de 20 estados têm uma proibição de aborto imposto por Trump, muitos sem exceções, mesmo em caso de violação ou incesto. Se ele ganhar, vai assinar uma proibição nacional do aborto\".",
