    "text": "NEW DELHI: In an effort to address the issue of stubble burning and lower the pollution levels in the national capital during winter, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Thursday inaugurated the use of a bio-decomposer mixture in Palla village in Narela.\nRai said the Delhi government will spray the bio-decomposer on over 5,000 acres of farmland to help mitigate winter pollution. To ensure effective implementation, 11 teams have been formed to carry out the spraying process across the designated areas, he added.\nThe bio-decomposer helps break down stubble, preventing farmers from resorting to burning crop residue, a significant contributor to seasonal pollution.\nIn a post on X, AAP shared the initiative’s progress, stating, “Another effective step... Today minister Gopal Rai inaugurated the spraying of bio de-composer mixture for decomposing stubble.”\nAs per the statement, the government has simplified the process for farmers to avail free bio-decomposer spraying by requiring only a form submission, with 841 farmers already participating. Rai emphasised that stubble burning is a major contributor to winter pollution and noted that bio-decomposer spraying, which was successful last year, has been reinitiated.\nThe initiative, part of the government’s 21-point winter action plan, also improves soil fertility. Rai highlighted that Delhi has seen a 34.6% reduction in pollution since 2016, with fewer polluted days. The bio-decomposer powder, sourced from the Pusa Institute, will be sprayed under government’s supervision.",

    "text": "New York Governor Kathy Hochul reiterated her comments that the immigrants responsible for the brutal attack on two police officers in Times Square should be deported.\n“Get them all and send them back,” Hochul told reporters during an unrelated news conference, the\nNew York Post.\n‘You don’t touch our police officers. You don’t touch anyone.\nHochul, who continued his U-turn on the border crisis at an event Wednesday, was asked whether immigrants and criminals like them should face deportation.\n“I think it’s actually something that should be looked at,” Hochul responded, despite previously touting the Empire State as a welcoming place for immigrants and backing the state’s controversial and sanctuary city laws.\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul has said deportation of the immigrants involved should be considered.\nJhoan Boada, 22, photographed joking with reporters, was arrested Monday night and charged with attempted assault on a police officer and gang assault.\n“I mean, if someone commits a crime against a police officer in New York state and they’re not here legally, it’s definitely worth investigating,” he said.\n“These are law enforcement officers who should never, under any circumstances, be subjected to physical assault,” Hochul added. “It’s wrong in every way and I hope the judges and prosecutors do the right thing.”\nPolice sources told\nhttps://nypost.com/2024/02/01/metro/police-believe-4-of-the-migrants-arrested-in-nyc-cop-beatdown-fled-to-california/ that four of the immigrants arrested in connection with the beating could have taken a bus to California.\nSources said authorities believe the group gave false names to a religious group that helps migrants leave the city and boarded a bus to California on Wednesday.\nYohenry Brito, 24, and Jandry Barros, 21, were arrested and charged with robbery and felony assault on Wednesday, according to the New York Police Department.\nThe brutal attack occurred on Saturday around 8:30 pm in Times Square when officers attempted to disperse a disorderly group in front of 220 West 42 Street.\nA fight broke out between a suspect in a yellow sweatshirt and police officers.\nAccording to the NYPD, the immigrants began attacking the officers, kicking them in the head and body while the two officers attempted to restrain one of the other men, ripping off his sweatshirt.\nThe migrants then fled, leaving unidentified police officers on the ground as they fled east on 42nd Street toward Seventh Avenue.\nThat night, four of them: Darwin Andrés Gómez Izquiel, 19, Kelvin Servat Arocha, 19, Juárez Wilson, 21, and Yorman Reverón, 24, were arrested.\nAll were charged with assault on a police officer, gang assault, obstruction of government administration and disorderly conduct.\nJhoan Boada, 22, was arrested Monday night and charged with attempted assault on a police officer and gang assault.\nYohenry Brito, 24, and Jandry Barros, 21, were arrested and charged with robbery and felony assault on Wednesday for the attack on police in Times Square.\nOn Wednesday night, Boada was also released without bail because he has no criminal record.\nPolice sources confirmed the immigration status of the men\nthe new york post. Several of the men’s addresses provided by police are homeless and migrant shelters.\nThree of the men, Izquiel, Arocha and Wilson, were released on personal recognizance, meaning they were released without bail while their case is pending.\nReverón was granted supervised release without bail. He already has two open cases for assault and robbery in Manhattan, after robbing and assaulting a Nordstrom Rack employee in November.\nHe also allegedly punched a loss prevention officer at the famous Herald Square Macy’s while trying to commit a robbery with two other suspects.\nOn Wednesday night, Boada was also released without bail because he has no criminal record.\nAs he left the courthouse, the 22-year-old raised his middle finger to reporters.\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams has repeatedly pointed to the justice system’s current practice of “catch, release, repeat” as the primary driver of crime in New York City.\nOver the summer, Adams blamed the city’s criminal justice system for turning the Big Apple into the “laughing stock of our entire country.”\nNew York City, in particular, has struggled under the weight of tens of thousands of migrants arriving at its borders in search of places to stay and other accommodations.\nIn 2023 alone, the city faced the arrival of more than 100,000 immigrants.\nHochul once welcomed asylum seekers with “open arms” and pledged to house them, but is now beginning to invite migrants to “go elsewhere” because the city is at its limit.\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams has repeatedly pointed to the justice system’s current practice of “catch, release, repeat” as the primary driver of crime in New York City.\nThe Democrat addressed the immigration crisis in September, warning that asylum seekers arriving in New York City will not be housed in hotel rooms as they have been in the past.\n“We have to get the word out that when you come to New York, you won’t have any more hotel rooms, we don’t have capacity,” Hochul said on CNN. “So we also have to properly communicate that we are at a limit: if you are going to leave your country, go somewhere else.”\nIt is a striking change from his statements in December 2021, when he promised to house and protect asylum seekers, before thousands of migrants began arriving each month from southern border states. More than 113,000 immigrants have arrived in the city since last spring.\n‘As you know, the Statue of Liberty is inscribed. It says, “Give me your tired, poor, huddled masses, who long to be free,” Hochul said earlier. “You are welcome with open arms and we will work to keep you safe… We will not only house you, but we will also protect you.”",

    "text": "El\npapa Francisco pidió a los gobernantes que “hagan todo lo posible” para lograr un alto el fuego en Gaza, un día después de que Estados Unidos, Egipto y Qatar apelaron a Israel y al Movimiento de Resistencia Islámica (Hamas) a negociar el fin de la guerra sobre la ‘hoja de ruta’ presentada la víspera por el presidente estadounidense, Joe Biden.\nEl documento de negociación incluye un alto el fuego en Gaza y la liberación de rehenes y detenidos. “Apelo a la sabiduría de los gobernantes para que cese la escalada y se haga todo lo posible en el diálogo y la negociación”, señaló el Pontífice tras el rezo del ángelus de este domingo.\nDel mismo modo instó a los fieles a no olvidarse de rezar por la paz en “la atormentada Ucrania, en Palestina, en Israel y en Myanmar”. Además pidió oraciones por la situación en Sudán, “donde la guerra que dura ya más de un año aún no ha encontrado una solución de paz”, apuntó.\n“Que se silencien las armas -manifestó-, y con el compromiso de las autoridades locales y de la comunidad internacional, se lleve ayuda a la población, y los numerosos desplazados y refugiados de Sudán puedan encontrar acogida y protección en los países vecinos”.\nEl papa Francisco, en el Vaticano\nEl Papa iba a trasladarse este domingo por la mañana a la basílica de San Juan de Letrán para la celebración del Corpus Christi, pero por la intensa lluvia en Roma permaneció en el Palacio Apostólico del Vaticano. Un gesto de cariño catedral de Roma que no hacía desde el año 2017, cuando precisamente estableció trasladar la fiesta al domingo, y no celebrarla tradicionalmente el jueves.\nAntes del rezo del ángelus, asomado a la ventana del Palacio Apostólico, el Pontífice recordó que la Eucaristía “evoca ante todo la dimensión del don”, porque Jesús “toma el pan no para consumirlo solo, sino para partirlo y darlo a los discípulos, revelando así su identidad y su misión”.\nJesús “entregó” toda su vida, dijo el Papa Francisco. Así, señaló: “celebrar la Eucaristía y comer este Pan, como hacemos especialmente los domingos, no es un acto de culto desvinculado de la vida o un simple momento de consuelo personal. En cambio, con su gesto, Jesús nos hace capaces de convertirnos también en pan partido para los demás, de compartir lo que somos y lo que tenemos”.\nFrancisco subrayó que estamos llamados a ser “eucarísticos”, es decir a ser personas que “ya no viven para sí mismas”, sino que “saben hacer de su vida un don para los demás”. Así ha dicho que “gracias a la Eucaristía” los fieles se convierten “en profetas y constructores de un mundo nuevo”.\nY aseguró: “Cuando superamos el egoísmo y nos abrimos al amor, cuando cultivamos los lazos de fraternidad, cuando participamos en los sufrimientos de nuestros hermanos y compartimos nuestro pan y nuestros recursos con los necesitados, cuando ponemos nuestros talentos a disposición de todos, entonces partimos el pan de nuestra vida como Jesús”.\n* Con información de Europa Press",

    "text": "Bahrain stunned Australia 1-0 after a late Harry Souttar own goal in a dramatic opening to Asia’s third round of World Cup qualifying on Thursday. There were no problems, however, for World Cup regulars Japan as Hajime Moriyasu’s side handed China a 7-0 thrashing at Saitama Stadium and six-times qualifiers Iran secured a 1-0 win over visitors Kyrgyzstan. The Bahrainis celebrated wildly after the final whistle at Robina Stadium on the Gold Coast having beaten Australia for the first time in seven attempts, making the perfect start to their bid to qualify for the finals for the first time. The Socceroos were already down to 10 men in the Group C contest after the dismissal of Kusini Yengi and Abdullah al-Khalasi’s cross took a wicked deflection off Souttar to wrongfoot goalkeeper Mat Ryan and give Bahrain the points. Japan, who are also in Group C alongside Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, had no such problems against an inept Chinese side that collapsed to an embarrassing loss. Wataru Endo gave the hosts the lead with a 12th-minute header and Kaoru Mitoma doubled the advantage when he nodded in Ritsu Doan’s cross in the dying moments of the half. Takumi Minamino scored twice in six minutes soon after the interval to put the result beyond doubt, but Moriyasu’s side refused to ease off against the already well-beaten Chinese. Substitute Junya Ito hit the fifth with a shot that was deflected past Wang Dalei by Jiang Guangtai before Daizen Maeda headed home the sixth with three minutes remaining. Takefusa Kubo put the seal on the win with the last kick of the game, slamming his shot into the roof of the Chinese goal. Brighton winger Mitoma, who has missed a chunk of this year with injury, was making his first appearance for Japan since the Asian Cup in January. “The home support was overwhelming and that allowed us to play well from the first whistle,” Mitoma said. South Korea were unable to find a way past Palestine goalkeeper Rami Hamada at Seoul World Cup Stadium in Group B in the first game under Hong Myung-bo after the former defender returned to coach the team in July. The Koreans trail Iraq in the early standings as Aymen Hussein’s header earned his side a 1-0 win over Oman in Basra. In Group A, the UAE fought back to defeat Qatar 3-1. Iran defeated Kyrgyzstan thanks to Mehdi Taremi’s 34th minute goal while Uzbekistan also claimed three points when Jaliloddin Marsharipov’s strike handed North Korea a 1-0 loss in Tashkent. The top two from each of the three groups progresses directly to the 2026 finals in the United States, Mexico and Canada with the third and fourth placed teams going into another round of qualifying.
