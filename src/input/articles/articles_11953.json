    "text": "Group of Palestinian-Americans skip Blinken meeting over Biden admin’s support for Israel’s offensive in Gaza\nBy Jennifer Hansler, and Khalil Abdallah, CNN\n(CNN) — A number of Palestinian-Americans refused to attend a roundtable meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday to discuss the\nsituation in Gaza in protest against the Biden administration’s ongoing support for Israel’s offensive in the war-torn strip – a military campaign that has exacted a massive humanitarian toll.\n“We do not know what more Secretary Blinken or President (Joe) Biden need to hear or see to compel them to end their complicity in this genocide,” several of those who rejected the invitation said in a press statement distributed by the non-profit Institute for Middle East Understanding (IMEU).\n“They show us every day whose lives they value and whose lives they consider disposable. We will not be attending this discussion which can only amount to a box-ticking exercise. Our families, our community and all Palestinians deserve better,” the signatories wrote.\n“There is one thing that we, our community and countless others around the US and the world, including American unions representing nearly 8 million workers and at least 47 US cities, have been asking of this administration: to demand a permanent ceasefire to save Palestinians lives and stop the destruction of Gaza,” they wrote. “A meeting of this nature at this moment in time is insulting and performative.”\nBlinken and other members of the Biden administration have\ncalled on Israel to do more to protect civilians and allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza. The officials, however, have continually rejected the idea of a ceasefire, instead advocating for “humanitarian pauses.”\nThursday’s meeting with Blinken comes amid continued outrage from many progressive Democrats, Muslim and younger voters about the administration’s handling of Gaza – opposition that poses a growing political problem for Biden. The refusal of several invitees to attend underscores the immense anger felt by many in the United States – including some within the federal government – over the toll from the conflict, which was launched following\nHamas’ brutal attack on Israel on October 7. More than 26,000 have been killed, hundreds of thousands have been displaced, and Gaza is on the brink of famine. More than 200 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the offensive.\nSix people did attend the meeting, a source familiar told CNN, and those who attended felt conflicted about doing so, but felt they should take advantage of the opportunity to speak to the need for urgent change in US policy toward Gaza.\n‘Soul-searching’\nOne of the invitees to the roundtable, Dr. Tariq Haddad, said in an intensely personal, 12-page letter to Blinken that he initially intended to go to the meeting.\nHowever, “after a lot of soul-searching I have decided that I cannot in good conscience meet with you today knowing this administration’s policies have been responsible for the death of over 80 of my family members including dozens of children, the suffering of hundreds of my remaining family, the famine my family is currently subjected to and the destruction of all my family’s homes,” Haddad wrote in the letter.\n“The more I thought about this meeting, the more I could not emotionally bring myself to look you in the eyes, Secretary Blinken, knowing you and President Biden have knowingly contributed to the suffering and murder of so many of my family, the homelessness and dispossession of 2 million Gazans, and the famine that has befallen my remaining family members,” Haddad said.\n“How does one meet for what I was told would be 3 minutes, with a person you hold responsible for not just the killing of your child, but rather the murder of over 80 of your family members?” he asked in his letter.\n“How do I look you in the eyes knowing you couldn’t even do the basic minimum like calling for a ceasefire to end the suffering and carnage, and even worse, are cutting off humanitarian assistance to 2 million people going through a famine of historic proportions,” he wrote, appearing to reference the suspension of US aid to the UN’s main relief agency in Gaza, UNRWA.\n“My family are subsisting on animal feed, Secretary Blinken, because of your policies,” he said.\n“You could have called for a cease-fire at any point in the past four months and ended all this suffering and death, and you have not. You could have used your diplomatic pressure to end the suffering, and you chose not to. You could have recognized that shutting off aid to an area that is experiencing the worst famine and human rights disaster in modern history is unethical, yet you chose not to. This is why it is very difficult emotionally for me to meet you today, to somehow normalize a meeting with an administration that continues day after day to cause so much suffering and death with their policies,” he wrote.\nHaddad urged Blinken to call for an immediate ceasefire, “end the continued transfer of US military reserve equipment to the Israeli military to stop further murder,” “call for an immediate withdrawal out of Gaza and equality for the Palestinian people,” and a “call for an end to the Israeli occupation, for equal rights, freedoms, and laws in this land regardless of one’s religion, ethnicity, or background.”\nHaddad told CNN that the letter – in which he also included photos of some of his relatives who have been killed – was going to be handed directly to Blinken at Thursday’s meeting.\nThe source familiar with the meeting said some parts of it were read out loud to the top US diplomat during the hour-and-a-half long session at the State Department. That source said Blinken seemed engaged, but largely stuck to talking points in his remarks.\nAt a briefing Thursday, State Department spokesperson Matt Miller confirmed that Blinken met with “a number of leaders in the Palestinian-American community.”\n“It was the latest in a series of meetings that the Secretary has had with individuals and organizations both within the department and from outside the department that hold a wide range of views across the ideological and political spectrum,” Miller said. “He has held these meetings because he thinks it’s important to hear directly from individuals as I said, both inside the State Department and outside the State Department.”\n“He finds that process to be constructive. It informs his thinking. It helps him, he believes, shape policy in the best way possible,” he said.\nPublic opposition\nAnd while Blinken was quietly confronted behind closed doors about the administration’s policy toward Gaza on Thursday, members of the administration, including Blinken, have also faced public displays of opposition. A number of protesters have camped in front of Blinken’s house since last Friday to try to pressure a change in policy.\nAt a public speech on Tuesday, Samantha Power, head of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) was twice confronted about the administration’s position toward Gaza.\nOne questioner, who identified herself as a USAID contractor, asked Power about the loss of the US’ ability “to be moral leaders” due to the “US funded genocide in Gaza.” Another person interrupted her speech to raise the massive humanitarian toll.\n“It is a devastating situation where not enough resources are getting in, via the Rafah crossing or the Kerem Shalom crossing,” Power said. “And we are working 24/7 to try to dramatically expand the flow of food, medicine, shelter – I mean, so much is needed. But, you know, you have families right now that are living in unimaginable conditions.”\n“In addition, of course, the greatest loss of life has come from the war itself and from the bombing, and more than 25,000 civilians have been killed. There is not a single call that President Biden makes, or engagement that anybody in the Biden administration does, that doesn’t put the importance of civilian protection and international humanitarian law, at the top of the conversation,” she said.\nA USAID spokesperson said that “since the start of this conflict, Administrator Power and other Agency leadership have held numerous engagements with staff in the US and at USAID Missions around the world to discuss the US and USAID response to the conflict, offer appreciation for their work, and hear a range of perspectives and concerns.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Even though he's left European club football behind, he's still plundering goals in the Saudi Pro League for Al Nassr, and has no plans yet to retire from the international game. Ronaldo is still a key part of the Portugal squad and, although he could not help them to glory at Euro 2024, his next appearance for his country in September 2024 saw him reach the milestone of 900 career goals . The Sporting News details Ronaldo's scoring record for Portugal and other key bits of CR7 information. MORE: How many goals has Cristiano Ronaldo scored for Al Nassr? How many goals does Cristiano Ronaldo have for Portugal? Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time leading goalscorer in men's international football with an outrageous record of 131 goals in 213 senior appearances for Portugal. Ronaldo broke the long-standing goal record that was held by Iran's Ali Daei when he bagged a brace against Republic of Ireland in September 2021. Ronaldo's 211 caps for Portugal also put him at the top of international football's all-time appearance list, ahead of Kuwait star Bader Al-Mutawa who has played 196 times for his country.

    "title": "AI, machine learning literally takes off in 2023 | The Market Herald",
    "text": "The capabilities of machine learning quickly became more obvious and mainstream in 2023 as powerful language model ChatGPT became widely used and Google’s Bard launched in January. It sparked a new wave of AI understanding and more deliberate usage, given we were already relying on machine learning through our conversations with Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa, facial recognition and fingerprint scanning technologies – to name just a few. Also in 2023, US Walmart stores introduced robots to scan shelves for inventory, Ford introduced it to optimise factory systems and detect failures, and Air India became the first airline to introduce a robot virtual agent, Maharaja, to answer more than 6000 customer questions across four languages. Pardon the pun, but AI is literally taking off… So how quickly is machine learning evolving and what part will it play by 2025? Dr Tiongliang Liu from the University of Sydney is a machine learning specialist. He is also the Director of the Sydney Artificial Intelligence Centre. He agrees it’s been a big year for machine learning. “There’s a new wave of AI, and especially the development of foundation models, they have very good performance,” he said. “For many tasks, they have comparable performance with human beings – that’s why they are very influential and they can be used for many sectors to improve our lives. This is really an exciting moment.” Just as humans draw on past learnings and experiences to solve problems, machines could use the accumulation of learnings, patterns of data and experience to do the same. “The philosophy of AI is to analyse the data, find the patterns by using the machine learning algorithms that can be fast, very efficient and very accurate, so it can save a lot of human labour,” Dr Liu said. Dr Liu said AI was being used in many sectors, including health, education, sustainable energy development and marketing. But areas of machine learning that Dr Liu expects will improve by 2025 include weather forecasting and predictions, agricultural and environmental applications and the accuracy of medical imaging-led diagnosis. “With AI technology we can detect which decisions are more reliable and which decisions may be incorrect and then we can invite more experts to investigate those not very reliable cases and help them to further improvement … this actually would be very helpful and could be used to save lives for very complicated cases,” he said. Australia’s part in a US-centric industry Dr Liu said there were significant improvements in creating digital people, which were now looking very natural. That’s something ASX-listed company [Unith (ASX:UNT)](https://themarketherald.com.au/asx-unt/) for example, has been developing. Other ASX-listed plays are also building their strategies on machine learning, tapping into emerging technologies. Examples include [Appen (ASX:APX)](https://themarketherald.com.au/?s=APX) which provides AI training data and annotation services and [Dubber Corporation (ASX:DUB)](https://themarketherald.com.au/asx-dub/) which offers AI-powered speech recognition and capturing technology. [Brainchip Holdings (ASX:BRN)](https://themarketherald.com.au/asx-brn/) claims to be developing spiking neutral processors for AI applications, [Volpara Health Technologies (ASX:VHT)](https://themarketherald.com.au/asx-vht/) is using AI for screening for breast cancer and [Telix Pharmaceuticals (ASX:TLX)](https://themarketherald.com.au/asx-tlx/) is using AI to progress drug discovery and developments. “Australia has a very good history of developing machine learning and AI, we have many very outstanding researchers who’re now, for example, overseas,” Dr Liu said. “I know there’s a lot of discussions about how the Government, how many different sectors can be involved with developing AI. “AI is very hot and now many researchers are working on this.” AI’s developing quickly thanks to the experts committed to the cause, along with hardware improvements. Concerns machines could overtake humans AI is a tool that could be developed and used for good and bad outcomes. “This (AI) is a tool which could be used for something negative, we should be very careful about this,” he said. He also warned that decisions made by AI were not always correct, even though there was a high probability of accuracy. Other risks exist too, especially around privacy and discrimination. “If we do more research and put more regulations, I believe those concerns can be very well addressed,” he said. “AI can also greatly improve the quality of human life (…) combined with human jobs we can do better things in the future.”",

Kommt Deutschland bis ins Endspiel, können Fans mit 999 Dollar für eine Karte den Turnier-Abschluss am 19. Juli im MetLife Stadium erleben. Beim vorzeitigen Ausscheiden des DFB-Teams erhält ein Fan aus einem anderen Land das Ticket.\nKnackpunkt: Laut FIFA-Portal ist dieses Kontingent für deutsche Fans bereits vergriffen. Wer 299 Dollar in die Hand nimmt, kann dagegen noch eine Option für Außenseiter wie beispielsweise Wales, Norwegen oder Jordanien kaufen. (pp)",
