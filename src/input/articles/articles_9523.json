    "text": "NFL player props: 5 best bets for Wild Card Weekend After fighting all season to get to the playoffs, weather could be the most dominant factor in 2 of the games and will have an impact on a couple of this week's Wild Card Weekend. Below, we analyze [BetMGM Sportsbook's](https://mediaserver.betmgmpartners.com/renderBanner.do?zoneId=1702752) NFL odds and lines, and tab the best NFL Wild Card Weekend player prop bets to cash in on among SportbookWire's [NFL expert picks and predictions](https://sportsbookwire.usatoday.com/category/nfl-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions/). For this week's picks, we have a running back going Over his projection in the freezing conditionals in Kansas City, a QB rushing for a TD in the snow in Buffalo, 2 running backs not hitting their numbers in climate-controlled conditions and one of the most dynamic wide receivers dominating his matchup. FOOTBALL NEVER STOPS Live games, analysis and more 7 days a week: [Get ESPN+](https://go.web.plus.espn.com/GjNV9m) NFL Wild Card Weekend prop bet picks and predictions Odds provided by [BetMGM Sportsbook](https://mediaserver.betmgmpartners.com/renderBanner.do?zoneId=1702752); access [USA TODAY Sports Scores and Sports Betting Odds hub](https://sportsdata.usatoday.com/football/nfl/scores) for a full list. Lines last updated Friday at 8:22 p.m. ET. All games ET unless noted. Texans RB Devin Singletary UNDER 66.5 rushing yards (-110) - Host Browns, Saturday, 4:30 p.m. (NBC) After a strong beginning when he became a starter, Singletary's numbers have dropped off primarily due to a lack a opportunities. He has topped this number just twice in his last 7 games. The reason for his lack of elite rushing days is that he has had 13 carries or fewer in 5 of the last 7 games, including just 9 carries against the Browns in Week 16. In order to top this number, he may need more than 15 carries and that may not be possible against a tough Browns defense that will make Houston earn everything it gets. Bills QB Josh Allen SCORES A TOUCHDOWN (-105) - Host Steelers, Sunday, 1 p.m. (CBS) Allen has scored 15 rushing TDs in his last 15 games, including 8 in his last 6 games. With a considerable amount of snow expected, when the Bills get near the goal line, Allen will likely call his own number to close out drives. He does when the weather is fine. He's likely to do it more often when the footing is bad and he knows where he's going while defenders try to react. Chiefs RB Isiah Pacheco OVER 66.5 rushing yards (-115) - Host Dolphins, Saturday, 8:10 p.m. (Peacock) One thing that is true about cold weather games is that the passing game is impacted much more negatively than the run game. No matter how sideline personnel try to keep the balls warm, when it's near zero degrees with 25 mph winds, the balls become like bricks in less than a minute. Pacheco has been the most consistent part of the Chiefs offense in their playoff run and has rushed 15 or more times in 5 of his 6 six games. In his last home game, he has rushed 18 times for 130 yards. With his speed and strength, if Pacheco gets 15 carries, which is very likely, it will be extremely difficult for the depleted Dolphins defense to keep him below this number. Lions RB Jahmyr Gibbs UNDER 52.5 rushing yards (-120) - Host Rams, Sunday, 8:15 p.m. (NBC) This one is a tough number not to surpass given the Lions elite offensive line, but there are a couple of factors that are going to make this number a little too high to pass barring a 20-yard carry along the way. The first is that veteran RB David Montgomery is the conventional runner coach Dan Campbell counts on to close out games and set the tone offensively. With the Lions making a rare playoff appearance, it is much more likely that Campbell will lean on Montgomery as the primary back and Gibbs as a change-of-pace/receiving back. The other issue is that the Rams are likely to come out throwing and try to turn the game into a shootout. If that happens, Gibbs may get his share of yardage as a receiver, but he likely won't get the carries he will need to top a number he hasn't beat in his last 2 games. Cowboys WR CeeDee Lamb OVER 98.5 receiving yards (-115) - Host Packers, Sunday, 4:30 p.m. (FOX) If the Cowboys are ever going to excise their playoff demons, it is going to require QB Dak Prescott to play some of the best ball of his career. To do that, it will require a heavy dose of Lamb. The Cowboys were chasing down the Eagles all season and have been playing playoff-style football for the last month and they have counted on Lamb to be the centerpiece of the offense. In his last 3 games, Lamb has caught 32 passes and posted yardage days of 118, 227 and 98. He has made his case of being the most dominant receiver in the league and will be targeted early often against a young Packers defense that will likely be unable to hold him down.

    "title": "La dimensión del desafío",
    "text": "Ante una catástrofe natural, la diferencia entre primer y tercer mundo no está en la cantidad de agua caída o en la intensidad que haya alcanzado en la escala un terremoto. Está en la respuesta dada por el Estado (que es la administración central y la autonómica, por eso los presidentes de comunidades tienen la consideración de máximos representantes del Estado en sus territorios) al suceso. Los ciudadanos pagan impuestos y ceden voluntariamente espacios de libertad individual para que existan mecanismos de prevención, antes, y de auxilio, después, que les protejan razonablemente de desastres que no se pueden evitar, pero sí paliar. Esa es la distancia que separa a los que hemos tenido la fortuna de vivir en países avanzados de los que sufren la desgracia de haber nacido en estados fallidos y países desestructurados: la de la fortaleza con la que se hace frente colectivamente a los desafíos. La dimensión de los daños humanos y materiales sufridos por Valencia como consecuencia de la DANA que se abatió sobre buena parte de la provincia el martes es colosal y no deja de agrandarse conforme pasan los días. El desastre marcará a varias generaciones. El reto al que se enfrentan los gobernantes es enorme, así que dejarles margen para trabajar es esencial. Tiempo habrá para determinar si los mecanismos de prevención funcionaron correctamente o no y exigir las correspondientes responsabilidades si en algún caso, como parece evidente, no lo hicieron. Por desgracia, tres días después, lo urgente sigue siendo localizar víctimas mortales, cuyo número aumenta sin cesar, encontrar desaparecidos, asistir a las miles de personas que se han quedado sin hogar, pero tampoco tienen los suministros básicos. El viernes por la mañana, me sorprendió la pregunta que me hizo una persona: “¿Dónde está durmiendo toda esa gente?”. Más allá de lo intuitivo (“en casas de amigos y familiares”), no tenía en ese momento una contestación clara y precisa a la cuestión. También me impactó la conversación que mantuve con un militar, que en tono admirablemente respetuoso me trasladaba su desolación porque no se estuvieran empleando con agilidad todos los medios de que el Ejército dispone y que, sorprendentemente, sí son utilizados con bastante presteza en las misiones internacionales que los efectivos españoles desarrollan desde hace años en los más diversos escenarios. “Tenemos tiendas de campaña, cocinas, camas, ingenieros… pero las órdenes están tardando demasiado”, me comentaba. La pregunta y el comentario son señales de que algo no está funcionando bien, de que sigue sin valorarse en su justa medida la magnitud de lo ocurrido y la reacción institucional dista todavía de ser la adecuada. Los presidentes Mazón y Sánchez han exhibido voluntad de aparcar sus diferencias para hacer frente al drama. Pero por debajo de ellos, la coordinación de sus equipos está demostrando ser difícil. Y eso lo están pagando los ciudadanos. Lo apuntaba el editorial que han publicado los periódicos de Prensa Ibérica en la Comunitat Valenciana, y hay que poner el foco en ello. La riada de Valencia ha dejado a la vista, como ningún otro desastre vivido hasta aquí, los rotos en las costuras de un Estado, federal en la descentralización de competencias, pero no en su legislación más básica. Donde el diálogo en momentos de crisis entre la miríada de organismos que deben ocuparse de ella no se produce, o se produce tarde o se desarrolla entre ruidos e interferencias. Hemos observado atónitos estos días cómo se discutía si el aviso a la población tenía que lanzarlo Mazón, por estar el suceso clasificado en “nivel 2”, o debía haberlo hecho Sánchez, si se hubiera contemplado “en el 3”. Que le pregunten a las víctimas qué nivel habrían preferido. Las víctimas estaban en el “nivel 0”. Más allá de lo que indiquen los protocolos establecidos que están manifestando desde el primer minuto sus ineficiencias, responder a la pregunta de quién está al mando sigue siendo sonrojantemente complicado. En medio de la polarización que vivimos, ni Mazón cede competencias, por miedo a que le acusen de ineptitud, ni Sánchez las coge, por temor a que le acusen de intervencionista, si no de algo peor. La única buena noticia que hemos recibido desde que el diluvio se desató es que Gobierno autonómico y Gobierno central se sientan ya en un centro de coordinación. Urge que se vayan tomando medidas en cascada aprovechando la enorme experiencia que tienen los técnicos del Estado y los autonómicos, las fuerzas de seguridad y los militares, las organizaciones humanitarias. Cada hora que pasa, es un siglo para los damnificados. Es preciso, además, que las Administraciones comiencen a encauzar la ola de solidaridad que se ha movilizado en toda España, porque sin control puede ser más perjudicial que beneficiosa y es terreno abonado para que los canallas saquen tajada. Ahora más que nunca se necesita empatía. Pero ordenada.",

    "title": "Let it snow: Ski industry to increasingly rely on artificial powder as climate warms - North Shore News",
    "text": "CALGARY — At Cypress Mountain ski resort, director of operations Jeremy Wentzel has been eagerly waiting for a chance to fire up the snow guns. The Vancouver ski destination has manufactured more than 81 acres of artificial snow for skiers and boarders to enjoy since opening for the season Dec. 7, but much of that was lost to rainfall and warm temperatures later in the month. With cooler weather in the forecast, however, Wentzel said a prime opportunity to pump out fresh powder could be just around the corner. \"We're just waiting for temperatures to fall slightly, because we're getting very, very close to a pretty significant snow-making window,\" Wentzel said. \"It has been a challenge this Christmas period. But temperatures do generally get there eventually, and then you get to put on display what having a robust snow-making system can do for you.\" Artificial snow-making — which involves using machines, or \"guns,\" to spray a mixture of water and compressed air that then freezes into snowflakes — has been used by the Canadian ski industry since its development in the 1950s. But with climate change now posing an existential threat to an industry that depends on winter weather, snow-making is expected to become more important than ever. A study by the University of Waterloo in partnership with the University of Innsbruck in Austria suggests snow-making production requirements by the Canadian ski industry will increase between 55 and 97 per cent by 2050, as climate change brings warmer winters and less natural snowfall. In Ontario alone, for example, changing weather patterns due to climate change could shorten the average length of the ski season by up to 60 per cent. Already, in an average winter, Canadian ski resorts produce an estimated 42 million cubic metres of machine-made snow. But making snow is not as simple as hitting a switch and blasting flakes wherever and whenever you want them. For one, the weather must be cold enough for water to freeze, so all the snow-making capability in the world won't help in an extended plus-zero-degreesstreak. \"There is a bit of a conundrum there,\" said Tara Lovell, spokeswoman for Ontario's Blue Mountain Resort, where an exceptionally mild December meant a very limited number of runs were open over the holiday season. \"I would say that our (snow-making) system hasn't been able to get up and running as much as we would have liked.\" Snow-making is also expensive. It requires the installation of water pipes and pumphouses, hydrants and snow guns across significant swaths of terrain. This year, Blue Mountain committed to a \"multi-year, multi-million-dollar\" investment in snow-making infrastructure improvements that includes enhancing the system's automation capabilities, Lovell said. These kinds of investments are meant to help the resort navigate increasingly erratic weather patterns, she added. \"Decades ago, you could kind of guarantee that winter will eventually come and we can make snow when it's here. But now, those snow-making windows can come in the middle of the night for just an hour here, an hour there,\" she said. \"So the more efficient our system is, the better off we are at making sure we're maximizing what we can, despite the volatility of Mother Nature.\" But while snow-making may be the ski industry's answer to climate change, it has also been criticized by activists for contributing to it. The University of Waterloo study found artificial snow production at Canadian ski resorts consumes 478,000 megawatt-hours of electricity annually and an estimated 43.4 million cubic metres of water. And as the demand for artificial snow grows, so too will ski resorts' demand for water and power. Waterloo professor Daniel Scott said the sustainability of snow-making varies greatly from location to location, depending on the source of the water and how green the local electricity grid is. He said the ski industry will need to ensure snow-making is being done in a responsible way — in particular, limiting negative impacts on downstream watersheds and conflict with other water users. \"(Snow-making) can be very unsustainable, or it can be very sustainable,\" Scott said. For her part, Lovell said she believes there are few industries more concerned about sustainability than the ski industry. \"I can’t forecast what is yet to come when it comes to climate change, but we do see those changes happening,\" she said. \"For our business to be sustainable, we need to make sure that we can continue to provide a snow-related product to our guests, despite what we're seeing and the trends that may be coming.\" Back at Cypress Mountain in Vancouver, Wentzel said the resort likely would not have been open at all over the holidays if it didn't have its snow-making system. He said making snow is a way for the ski industry to take back some control from Mother Nature. \"Snow-making has been a huge investment priority for us,\" he said. \"It's a pretty big insurance policy for the mountain, because it allows you to manage your own fate, if you will.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 5, 2024.

    "title": "Calor extremo na Antártica: temperaturas sobem 10°C acima da média | Exame",
    "text": "Nos últimos meses, a Antártica , conhecida por seu frio extremo, tem enfrentado uma situação atípica: uma onda de calor que elevou as temperaturas médias em 10°C acima do normal, com picos de até 28°C a mais do que o esperado em alguns dias de julho. Este fenômeno climático alarmante reforça as preocupações sobre os impactos das mudanças climáticas nas regiões polares, tradicionalmente consideradas como termômetros das transformações globais no clima. As informações são do The Guardian .\nEnquanto o inverno no hemisfério sul normalmente cobre a Antártica em escuridão e temperaturas negativas extremas, as condições climáticas deste ano desafiaram as expectativas. Nos últimos 12 meses, o mundo tem experimentado recordes consecutivos de calor, com temperaturas consistentemente acima do limite de 1,5°C em relação aos níveis pré-industriais. Esse limite é amplamente considerado pelos cientistas como crucial para evitar os piores impactos das mudanças climáticas.\nMichael Dukes, diretor de previsão do tempo da MetDesk, destacou que, embora os picos diários de temperatura sejam impressionantes, a elevação média ao longo do mês é ainda mais significativa. Segundo Dukes, os modelos climáticos há muito preveem que as regiões polares seriam as mais afetadas pelas mudanças climáticas antropogênicas, e a atual situação na Antártica é um exemplo claro disso.\nCausas da onda de calor Os cientistas apontam que o aquecimento contínuo durante o inverno antártico pode levar a um colapso dos mantos de gelo, o que teria implicações catastróficas para o nível do mar em todo o mundo. Embora julho de 2024 não tenha quebrado todos os recordes de temperatura anteriores, ele ainda ficou 0,3°C acima de qualquer outro mês de julho registrado anteriormente.\nZeke Hausfather, pesquisador da Berkeley Earth, afirmou que a onda de calor na Antártica foi um dos principais fatores por trás do aumento das temperaturas globais nas últimas semanas. Segundo ele, a Antártica tem aquecido junto com o resto do planeta nos últimos 150 anos, o que significa que qualquer onda de calor já parte de uma base mais elevada de temperatura.\nA causa imediata dessa onda de calor foi atribuída a um enfraquecimento do vórtice polar, uma faixa de ar frio e baixa pressão que gira na estratosfera em torno dos polos. Esse fenômeno, combinado com um forte evento El Niño, contribuiu para o aquecimento em toda a região. Cientistas como Amy Butler, da Administração Nacional Oceânica e Atmosférica dos Estados Unidos (NOAA), observaram que ondas atmosféricas interferiram no vórtice polar, elevando as temperaturas em altitudes elevadas.\nPreocupações científicas A onda de calor deste ano é a segunda a atingir a região em dois anos consecutivos, com a anterior ocorrendo em março de 2022, quando houve um aumento de 39°C nas temperaturas, causando o colapso de uma porção do manto de gelo do tamanho de Roma. Além disso, o aumento das temperaturas na Antártica em julho segue um evento El Niño particularmente forte, que é conhecido por causar aquecimento global, além de um efeito retardado das temperaturas mais altas causadas pela crise climática. Jamin Greenbaum, geofísico do Instituto Scripps de Oceanografia da Universidade da Califórnia em San Diego, expressou preocupação com o futuro da região, observando um aumento no derretimento das geleiras durante suas expedições de campo ao longo dos anos.\nEmbora ainda não esteja claro o quanto a crise climática contribuiu especificamente para este evento, cientistas como Jonathan Wille, pesquisador de ciência climática da ETH Zürich, sugerem que as ondas de calor na Antártica estão se tornando mais frequentes. No entanto, ele ressalta que serão necessários estudos de atribuição para determinar com precisão o papel das mudanças climáticas na criação dessa onda de calor específica.\nAcompanhe tudo sobre: Antártica Clima Mudanças climáticas",

    "text": "By Jorge Fitz-Gibbon ,\n4 hours ago\nThey could be ticking timebombs.\nWestchester County health officials are imploring a pair of good Samaritans who dropped a rabid cat off at a Yonkers animal hospital to come forward — because they could be infected with the fatal disease.\nThe anonymous pair was caught on surveillance video pulling off their good deed last week, but left without giving shelter workers their names — and could now face a lethal health hazard.\nHealth officials said this woman carried an injured cat to the Yonkers Animal Hospital last week and could now be infected with rabies. Westchester Gov P’Nut the squirrel can’t rest in peace in NY — his headless body held by the state as ‘evidence’\nThis man and a woman may have been infected after dropping a rabid cat off at a Yonkers animal hospital. Westchester Gov “Rabies is fatal, but it is also 100% preventable with post-exposure treatment,” county Health Commissioner Dr. Sherlita Amler said in a statement this week .\n“If you see an injured or sick animal, call police,” Amler said. “Teach your children to not approach or handle animals they don’t know, even if they appear young, injured or friendly, and to tell you right away if they are bitten or scratched by any animal.”\nRabies expert says NYS’s own data reveal why it was ‘insane’ to kill, decapitate P’Nut the squirrel\nBut the cautionary advice comes too late for the Yonkers do-gooders, who county officials said were only trying to help the year-old feline after it was possibly struck by a car.\nThe cat, which was left at the Yonkers Animal Hospital on Saw Mill River Road shortly before 4:30 pm on Dec. 12, later tested positive for rabies, the health department said.\nSecurity camera footage from the site showed a man wearing a red checkered jacket, khaki pants and a black hat, and a woman in a black jacket who carried the cat in a beige tote bag.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR METRO DAILY NEWSLETTER\nRabies is a viral infection carried by animals that can prove fatal to humans without treatment with a rabies vaccine. Steve Heaslip/Cape Cod Times / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 60,000 people in the US receive medical treatment every year after exposure to rabig animals.\nRabies is a viral disease transmitted to humans by animals and can be fatal if untreated.\nWhile there is no indication the Yonkers good Samaritans were infected, the county wants to make sure.\n“Unusual behavior may be the first sign of rabies in an animal,” the county said in a press release. “A rabid animal may become either abnormally aggressive or unusually tame.\n“It may lose fear of people and become excited and irritable, or appear particularly passive and lethargic,” the release said. “Staggering and frothing at the mouth are sometimes noted.”\nFor the latest metro stories, top headlines, breaking news and more, visit nypost.com/metro/\n9",

    "text": "Alabama is set to execute an inmate with nitrogen gas. How does it work?\nBy Lauren Mascarenhas, CNN\n(CNN) — At some point during a 30-hour window that will close at 6 a.m. CT on Friday, the state of Alabama is set to carry out the nation’s first execution by nitrogen gas on death row inmate Kenneth Smith.\nSmith, who was sentenced to death for his role in a 1988 murder for hire and already survived a botched execution attempt by lethal injection, is at the center of a heated debate over whether the execution method constitutes cruelty.\nSmith’s lawyers have made several eleventh-hour attempts to prevent the execution.\nThe US Supreme Court on Wednesday denied Smith’s request for a stay of execution this week.\nA separate federal appeals court ruling on Wednesday evening also declined to halt the execution. Smith’s team appealed to the US Supreme Court again Thursday morning.\n“Execution is a very specific kind of punishment, and no punishment, according to the US Constitution, can be carried out in a cruel fashion,” Dr. Joel Zivot, an associate professor of anesthesiology and surgery at Emory University, told CNN. “And so the only real question is: Is execution with nitrogen gas cruel?”\nWhy nitrogen gas?\nOfficials started using lethal injection to kill people on death row about 40 years ago, and it’s since become the most widely used execution method across the 27 states where capital punishment is legal.\nAround 2009, the drugs used to carry out lethal injections became harder to access, and states began turning to alternative drugs – a shift that has been tied to a\nsurge of complications with the procedure.\nThat’s what happened when Alabama first tried to execute Smith in November 2022, and officials were unable to set an intravenous line before the execution warrant expired.\nOnly three states – Alabama, Oklahoma and Mississippi – have approved the use of nitrogen gas for capital punishment, and experts say there is no real blueprint for the execution method. Alabama has published a protocol for the procedure, though it contains redactions the state says are meant to maintain security.\nHow does it work?\nAlabama officials plan to use a mask to administer the nitrogen to Smith. Zivot says Smith will likely be strapped down when this occurs.\nNitrogen hypoxia will occur when a high concentration of the gas is inhaled, replacing oxygen in the body and causing death.\nThe process essentially disables the respiratory system, said Dr. Jonathan Groner, a professor of surgery at The Ohio State University College of Medicine.\nSome officials say that a person will likely lose consciousness shortly into the procedure, making it more humane than other execution methods. However, doctors say that they cannot pinpoint if or when a person will lose consciousness when exposed to high concentrations of nitrogen gas.\nBecause the circumstances of Smith’s planned execution are so specific and unique, it’s hard to draw comparisons to instances where nitrogen gas played a role in accidental or suicide deaths, Groner said.\nIs the procedure painful?\nThis month,\nUnited Nations experts raised the alarm that Smith’s execution could constitute torture, saying in a news release, “We are concerned that nitrogen hypoxia would result in a painful and humiliating death.”\nWhile doctors can’t say definitely what will happen to Smith, the possibilities have left many concerned.\nIf the mask is not secured tightly enough, oxygen could leak in, prolonging the death, experts say.\n“When we put 100% non-rebreather face masks on our patients, they never get 100%, because there’s some leakage,” Groner said. “I feel pretty confident that he’s not going to just take a deep breath and go to sleep. I think that’s unlikely.”\nDoctors say the lack of oxygen could lead to seizures, which have been observed in patients experiencing hypoxia.\nThere’s also a possibility that Smith could vomit into the mask, which could cause choking or asphyxiation if inhaled into the lungs.\nThe Department of Corrections altered Smith’s last meal schedule after concerns were raised that he had been “vomiting repeatedly.”\nEven if a person is fasting, they can still vomit water or stomach fluids, experts say. If stomach acid is aspirated, it could burn the lungs, Zivot noted.\nThe stress, anxiety or flat-out fear that a person might feel before execution shouldn’t be ruled out, Groner said.\n“When we have an operation and someone’s totally terrified, they actually respond differently to anesthetics, so a lot of times we’ll give them a sedative before we even go into the operating room,” he said. “There’s no talk anywhere of giving (Smith) anything to relax him.”\nWith\nmost lethal injections, a person is first given an anesthetic to render them unconscious.\nIncreased stress has been linked to\nheart attacks and other medical events.\nIn a botched 2014 execution, Oklahoma death row inmate\nClayton Lockett was declared dead of a heart attack more than an hour after being strapped to a gurney for an attempted lethal injection.\nOfficials say Smith’s execution is likely to take place on Thursday evening, and what happens in that Alabama execution chamber could set a precedent for other death row prisoners in the state and beyond.\nIf the procedure does not kill Smith, complications could leave him injured or with serious brain damage, experts say.\n“If they produce a corpse, then the states that want to do this will start doing it,” said Zivot.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
