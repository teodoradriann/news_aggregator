    "title": "The rise of Morgan Rogers: 'Unai Emery drags the best out of you - he battered me over one little thing'",
    "text": "The rise of Morgan Rogers: ‘Unai Emery drags the best out of you – he battered me over one little thing’\nThe Aston Villa attacking midfielder goes from one demanding coach to another as he joins up with Thomas Tuchel at England\nA manager imported at considerable expense tends to be demanding, his high standards and attention to detail rendering him a perfectionist. So Morgan Rogers can testify. The Aston Villa attacking midfielder is a rookie at international level, but 14 months under Unai Emery could serve as a fine grounding for his time playing for Thomas Tuchel and England.\nEmery has enabled a footballer who was relegated from the Championship two years ago to score a Champions League hat-trick this season. He has taken Rogers to levels few envisaged; certainly not Manchester City when they sold him in 2023. He has done it, a grateful Rogers grins, by always wanting more.\n“Never a moment’s rest,” he said. “When you probably least expect it is where he'll catch you out, telling you about yourself. For me personally, I wouldn't change it. It's what you need sometimes, when you've had a few good games, sometimes you might not be as at it, that 1 per cent. He will make sure that 1 per cent is nipped in the bud straight away. He always drags the best out of you.\n“Probably when you first come into the dressing room you don't take it the best way, you don't know how to handle it. You come in the changing room really happy, and then he'll just have a go at you about something.\n“I can think of the best games I've had, and he'll come up to me and batter me for one little thing I did in the 20th minute... I go home annoyed, and I'd thought I'd played pretty well. That's how he is.”\nAnd so to life under Tuchel. The German introduced himself by video call a month or two ago and kept in regular touch, letting Rogers know which Villa games he would be at. The 22-year-old won his first two caps under the caretaker Lee Carsley. He made the cut for Tuchel and the German has made quite an impression on him as England prepare to face Albania at Wembley in Friday’s World Cup qualifier.\n“The presence is a bit different,” he said. “Certain managers have different ways about them. Certainly his aura is one I’ve not experienced before. He has that level of confidence, that level of respect already. You can see the way he is, the way he acts. He has been so chilled and calm. But when it is time to work, it is time to work.”\nRogers is a good talker, engaging and interested, thoughtful and witty. Tuchel believes England need to get better at talking, especially in difficult moments. “The communication aspect,” Rogers highlighted, detailing Tuchel’s early message. “When momentum shifts in a game, we stick together. It’s not going to go perfect. We’re playing the best teams in the world, the best players in the world; we’re not going to be on top every game. We’d like to be, but that’s not how football works, regardless of how good you are and what team you’re in.”\nThat explains in part Tuchel’s most controversial choice, the recall of the vocal veteran Jordan Henderson. Rogers is encountering the 2019 Champions League-winning captain for the first time. “There is a massive level of respect and that sense of how much of a leader he is,” he said. “You can see how he pushes people on. Squads are all about balance. You can’t have a group of 25 young players who’ve never had any experience before.”\nHe is better acquainted with another who was brought out of the cold. Marcus Rashford is back on international duty, reaping an early reward for joining Rogers at Villa. “I think he has always got that confidence and belief he would get back here, maybe not as quick because it feels like he has only been at Villa for a week,” smiled Rogers.\nHe welcomed the arrival of a man who he could have viewed as a rival for his place. “When we go into games, no one is worrying about me,” he said, self-deprecatingly given his own excellence. “It is nice because everyone is scared of everything he can do. He is a joy to play with and a joy to work with and for Villa to attract players of that level shows the level we are going.”\nThat journey has taken them to the Champions League quarter-finals. Get past Paris Saint-Germain and it could lead to a reunion in the second city, with Jude Bellingham, a friend for years. “That would be good... I don't think he'd enjoy going to Villa Park much,” said Rogers of the Birmingham prodigy.\nThey go way back, to a floodlit tournament, at Under-15 level, with Rogers representing West Bromwich Albion and Bellingham playing above his age group for Birmingham. The Real Madrid superstar was fast-tracked to the senior England team. Rogers took more of a roundabout route.\n“Some people can go straight to the top and fit in. I needed games in the EFL to mould me and improve me. I needed to go through those difficult periods to find out about myself as a person and as a player,” he said. “We've had a really good relationship. Our careers and paths have been completely different but [we have] always been in contact along the journey, which is really nice. It makes it a bit sweeter.”\nBellingham referenced that long-time friendship with a picture of the pair together in England youth teams. Rogers joked that his mate hasn’t changed. “He's always had a mouth on him,” he said. And if they do face each other again in the last of the Champions League, there may be a good omen for Emery and Villa if Bellingham plays. “He's never beaten me,” said Rogers.\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\n[Comments]",

Amministrazione locale russa offre ai bambini un viaggio-premio nella “affascinante” Corea del Nord.\nMYANMAR\nL’esercito golpista del Myanmar ha fatto irruzione ieri nel villaggio di\nHapakant, nello Stato settentrionale Kachin, fermando oltre 30 persone fra cui leader cristiani e adolescenti con l’accusa di sostenere un gruppo ribelle. Un centinaio di soldati hanno assaltato l’area prima dell’alba, radunando i residenti in una scuola. I fermati sono stati rilasciati dopo nove ore di interrogatorio. Almeno 20mila intrappolati nei combattimenti a Maungdaw, nello Stato occidentale Rakhine.\nLIBANO\nIn un decennio il\ntasso di povertà in Libano è triplicato, colpendo una persona su tre e inasprito dalla crisi economica divampata nel 2019 e dal conflitto a sud con Israele. Secondo un rapporto della Banca mondiale il dato è passato dal 12% nel 2012 al 44% nel 2022 e, in alcune zone rurali, il tocca il 62%. Per quanto riguarda i rifugiati siriani nove su 10 sono sotto la soglia di povertà.\nCOREA DEL SUD - CINA - GIAPPONE\nI leader di Corea del Sud, Cina e Giappone si\nincontreranno il 26 e 27 maggio a Seoul per i primi colloqui trilaterali in oltre quattro anni.

    "text": "SUBSCRIBE Our weekly email is chockful of interesting and relevant insights into Jewish history, food, philosophy, current events, holidays and more...\nThe Hamas massacre reminded me of Jean-Paul Sartre’s immoral defense of terrorism as a weapon for the oppressed.\n30 September 1956. Algiers. A young Muslim law student named Zohra Drif dresses up as a European and walks into an ice cream parlor full of French families enjoying the warm Sunday afternoon. She has a peach Melba at the bar, leaves a bomb in a bag and walks out. The bag detonates, killing three and maiming many others, including children.\nThe Age of Terror had begun.\nA still from the famous Milk Bar bombing scene in the film The Battle of Algiers (1966)\nThe question of Algeria’s independence from France instantly divided French and European intellectuals, with combat hottest between France’s two most prominent intellectuals Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. Sartre, long a champion of independence movements, was completely gung-ho for the cause of Algerian independence. The Algerian-born Camus, less so.\nThough Camus was sensitive to the plight of Algerians, who’d languished under French colonial apartheidism for nigh on 130 years (see his excellent journalism on the subject in the book Algerian Chronicles ), he was abhorred by the Algerian rebels’ use of terrorism, which was becoming more frequent, and gruesome. Homes were invaded. Throats slits. Buses machine-gunned. Civilians raped and mutilated.\nFor that reason, he never fully embraced the idea of Algerian independence. He famously said, referencing fears for the well-being of his mother, at that time still living in Algeria:\n“I have always condemned terrorism. I condemn the blind terrorism that strikes in the streets of Algiers, which could strike my mother or my family. I believe in justice, but I will defend my mother first.”\nCamus’ refusal to play freedom fighter for his own native, albeit colonized, land, irked much of the French intellectual establishment, and marked the end of his creaky association with Sartre, who would have few nice things to say of Camus thereafter. (See Andy Martin’s excellent book The Boxer and the Goalkeeper: Sartre vs Camus [2013].)\nMy disenchantment with Sartre deepened when I became aware that he was a dedicated socialist and, worse, a Stalin sympathizer. In May of ‘68, the aging revolutionary, who could barely walk by that time, showed up in the middle of the riots and, bullhorn in hand, led the charge against the faceless forces of oppression, an event which has been called Sartre’s renunciation of communism, which he’d come to view as innately “reactionary,” and heralded the start of his latest and, as it turned out, last, vanity project: dismantling the Police State, something he felt the Nation-State embodied. Thus, out with Israel, in with Palestine, a position he would soon make disturbingly clear.\nThough Sartre had supported Israel’s creation in ’48, and was friendly to Israel throughout the 50s and 60s, even condemning antisemitism against Israelis in a 1967 article, by the 70s he seemed to have moderated his stance somewhat, and seemed to be growing friendlier to the cause of “Palestinian liberation,” telling a biographer in the early 70s: “I have always supported counterterror against established terror. And I have always defined established terror as occupation.” Again, the Police State he so abhorred and felt was the enemy of Human Freedom.\nWhat should have worried Sartre was that the Palestinian cause was inextricably bound up with anti-Semitism, a fact of which he was most certainly aware judging from his prior statements, and which had been enough to keep another prominent French communist intellectual of the time Michel Foucault (Camus was dead by now), from embracing the Palestinian cause or the P.L.O. Foucault is said to have seen that the Palestinian liberation movement was bound up with pure anti-Semitism, and been disturbed by it. Thus, Foucault wisely kept his distance. As a result, Foucault, once a left-wing hero, is today something of a pariah on the left, as is Sartre, to some extent, for his steady early support of Israel.\nIn his final decade, in deep for the Radical Palestinian cause, Sartre made his infamous statement on the massacre of the Israeli Olympic team at the Munich Olympics, published in an obscure communist rag on October 15, 1972:\n“The Palestinians’ only weapon is terrorism. It is a terrible weapon but the oppressed poor have no other… This abandoned, betrayed, exiled people can show its courage and the force of its hate only by organizing deadly attacks. Of course these should be viewed politically, by assessing the intended results against those actually obtained... The principle of terrorism is that one must kill… We must in fact recognize that the Munich attack succeeded perfectly. It took place amidst an international sporting event that attracted hundreds of panelists from all countries; for this reason it assumed world importance, and, thereby, put the Palestinian question before the whole world.”\nWords that will live in infamy. A total abdication of morality and reason on the part of one of the 20 th century’s most lauded thinkers.\nI thought about Sartre and his immoral statement during the aftermath of Hamas’ barbaric attacks on Israelis on October 7, and marveled how, during the Israeli response to the attacks, the preponderance of condemnation fell almost exclusively on Israel, while Hamas’s gruesome murders and child rapes (even rapes of dead bodies, burnings alive) were treated as mere footnotes, as the Fog of War, or simply not mentioned at all, by opinionmakers in media and academe. I found myself empathizing with Camus’ position that while one may acknowledge the injustice of occupation, the use of terrorism against civilians, whether “blind” or strategic, is always immoral, and there is no justification for it ever . Calling it “counterterror,” as Sartre did, does not wash. Nor is foreign occupation itself an act of terrorism, but rather one of theft and greed, which requires remedies that do not involve, or require, the slaughter of innocents.\nIn addition, the October 7 mess made me less inclined to think a two-state position for Israel-Palestine is possible, or even desirable, since no civilized people will, or should, negotiate with the likes of Hamas, not while they’re carrying off children to be drugged, molested and murdered.\nSadly, the cold-hearted position of Sartre, and Ms. Drif, the Milk Bar Bomber, who’s still alive and expresses no regret for her murderous action (in 2017 she even published a memoir of her “freedom fighting” years), has pretty much become the default position of the media, academe, the Left, globally, and, perhaps most disturbingly, our youth. A Harvard/Harris poll taken earlier this month found that 66% of Americans ages 18-24 said what Hamas did on October 7 was genocide, yet 60% said such actions were justified.\nWhat a bright future we have to look forward to.
