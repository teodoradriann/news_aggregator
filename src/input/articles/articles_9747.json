    "text": "DENVER — Coloradans who had a vehicle or catalytic converter stolen in 2023 may be able to get money to help offset some of the costs of dealing with theft thanks to new funds made available through the state. SB23-257, or the [Auto Theft Prevention Cash Fund,](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/SB23-257) made available roughly $5 million of general funds to support victims who need help with secondary costs. “The secondary costs aren’t things like vehicle replacement, or vehicle repair, those would be primary costs. These are secondary things that may be unknown to folks when their vehicle is stolen or recovered that we can assist with,” said Cale Gould, Public Outreach Coordinator with the [Colorado Auto Theft Prevention Authority.](https://csp.colorado.gov/services-we-provide/colorado-auto-theft-prevention-authority) Fees covered include money to help offset the costs of towing and storing a stolen vehicle. Gould said some of the fees covered are part of dealing with theft that people might not consider. “Generally if it is either operable or part of a larger investigation, it is taken to a tow yard or a police impound lot. And there's fees associated with that,” said Gould. When [auto theft victims in Colorado](https://www.denver7.com/news/state-news/colorado-car-thefts-are-down-after-pandemic-surge-state-crime-data-shows) do get their vehicle back, they often find it to be in a less than desirable condition. There is assistance to help cover some of the costs of getting the stolen ride back into better condition. “And this will include detailing, cleaning a vehicle to make it again, you know, usable in a comfortable way,” said Gould. Financial assistance might also be available to help cover the costs of temporary transportation like RTD passes and Uber fees when a vehicle is stolen. Catalytic converter theft in Colorado has skyrocketed over the last few years and the state has made available funds to help those victims with secondary costs. [ 3:20 PM, Jul 01, 2023 ](https://www.denver7.com/news/local-news/new-auto-theft-laws-take-effect-in-colorado) Local News New auto theft laws take effect in Colorado Gould said victims can apply for money to help cover hardening devices to protect your catalytic converter from theft. To qualify for assistance for either auto or catalytic converter theft, the vehicle must have had current registration when the theft occurred. An important date to remember is July 1, 2023. Coloradans can apply for help only if they had their vehicle or catalytic converter stolen after July 1. Coloradans who want to get financial help to cover secondary costs due to auto or catalytic converter theft must apply at [lockdownyourcar.org](https://lockdownyourcar.org/) and visit the [victim’s assistance page.](https://lockdownyourcar.org/resources/victims-assistance/) The site details what is covered and how to apply. Gould said the grant application process is made easier by working through a local advocate. “We try and provide a personal response, personal touch to a single person to guide you through the process as it can be very challenging to understand how to apply,” said Gould. “We want to make sure that everybody applies and has guidance in doing such.” The website, through Colorado State Patrol’s Victim Services Unit [lists the various districts throughout the state and which advocate](https://csp.colorado.gov/services-we-provide/victim-rights) serves your local area. While auto theft in Colorado surged over the last couple of years, the state has seen a decline in 2023. [Data from the Colorado Auto Theft Prevention Authority](https://coloradocrimestats.state.co.us/tops/report/mvt/colorado/2023) showed 29,098 vehicles were stolen through October of this year. That's a significant decline from the 41,184 vehicles reported stolen in Colorado throughout 2022. The 2023 data does not reflect November or December thefts. The Denver Police Department also reported a [25 percent decline in auto thefts in 2023, showing 11,865 stolen vehicles](https://denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Police-Department/Crime-Information/Additional-Crime-Dashboards) which is down from the 14,813 reported in 2022. While auto thefts in Denver have declined, catalytic converter thefts continued to climb in data reported by DPD in 2023. [ 5:31 PM, Dec 11, 2023 ](https://www.denver7.com/news/state-news/colorado-car-thefts-are-down-after-pandemic-surge-state-crime-data-shows) State News Colorado car thefts are down after pandemic surge, state crime data shows DPD statistics showed 3,022 stolen catalytic converters this year compared to 2,676 thefts in 2022. To give context in those numbers, the vast majority of increases in catalytic converter theft in Denver happened at Denver International Airport at DIA's associated parking and rental car lots. There was a staggering 857 percent increase in catalytic converter theft at DIA in 2023. According to DPD's statistics, all other police districts showed a year-over-year decline in catalytic converter thefts.",

    "text": "Webb Space Telescope captures photos of asteroid that caused a stir\nThe Webb Space Telescope has captured pictures of the asteroid that caused a stir earlier this year when it topped Earth’s hit list.\nDiscovered late last year, the asteroid 2024 YR4 was predicted at one point to have a 3% chance of smacking Earth in 2032.\nAdditional observations prompted scientists to reduce the threat to virtually zero, where it remains.\nBut there is a slight chance it could hit the Moon then.\nThe asteroid swings our way every four years.\nNasa and the European Space Agency released the photos – showing the asteroid as a fuzzy dot – on Wednesday.\nWebb confirmed the asteroid is nearly 200ft (60 metres) across, or about the height of a 15-storey building, according to the two space agencies.\nIt is the smallest object ever observed by the observatory, the biggest and most powerful ever sent into space.\nJohns Hopkins University astronomer Andrew Rivkin said the observations by Webb served as “invaluable” practice for other asteroids that may threaten us down the road.\nGround telescopes have also tracked this particular space rock over the past few months.\nAll this “gives us a window to understand what other objects the size of 2024 YR4 are like, including the next one that might be heading our way”, Mr Rivkin, who helped with the observations, said in a statement.",

    "title": "Lawyers who sued Bears over anti-white discrimination allege double cross by ex-paralegal plaintiff",
    "text": "A Chicago law firm that secured a quick settlement from the Chicago Bears in a lawsuit accusing the organization of anti-white racial discrimination has now asked a federal judge for a time out in that case, saying they have filed suit against one of the firm's former paralegals, who served as the lead plaintiff in the action against the Bears, flagging their ex-employee for allegedly interfering with the deal, allegedly out of anger at the amount of legal fees the firm was claiming from the settlement.\nOn Oct. 22, the Trent Law Firm, of Chicago, asked a Chicago federal judge for a stay in the proceedings in the case against the Bears.\nIn that motion, the Trent Law Firm said more work may be needed to finalize the settlement with the Bears, as they pursue legal action against their former paralegal, Jonathan Bresser Jr.\nThe case against the Bears touched down in federal court in March, when attorneys from the Trent firm filed suit against the team on behalf of Bresser, the plaintiff.\nBresser, identified as a white male student at DePaul University's Law School, claimed in the action that the Bears had violated federal anti-discrimination laws by limiting a so-called \"diversity\" jobs program only to law school students who are \"people of color\" or female.\nIn addition to the Bears organization itself, the lawsuit also named as defendants the team's Chairman George McCaskey and members of the organization's human resources and \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" teams.\nAccording to the lawsuit, Bresser responded to a job listing through the program for a \"Legal Diversity Fellow\" position.\nAccording to the lawsuit, the Bears specifically listed in the job posting that applicants must be \"a person of colar and/or female law student.\" The job ad also listed other qualifications for the position, including \"a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale;\" \"demonstrated ability to maintain confidentiality;\" \"excellent research and writing skills;\" \"proficient in Microsoft Office ... and Adobe Acrobat;\" and \"demonstrated ability to effectively manage and prioritize multiple projects ..., deadlines and initiatives with minimal supervision.\"\nIn the lawsuit, Bresser claimed he met or exceeded every listed qualification for the position, except for being a white male.\nThe lawsuit sought a court order requiring the Bears to end hiring practices based on race and gender and directing the Bears and the individual defendants to pay him unspecified money damages, plus attorney fees.\nAccording to court documents and his Linkedin profile, Bresser worked at the Trent Law Firm at the time the lawsuit was filed.\nAfter just about five months at odds in Chicago federal court, Bresser and the Bears indicated at the end of August that the parties had clinched a \"binding settlement agreement.\"\nCourt documents have not disclosed the terms of any such settlement.\nHowever, according to the Oct. 22 filing, that settlement has allegedly now been jeopardized by alleged acts of potential sabotage by Bresser.\nIn the filing, the Trent Law Firm said it intended to file suit against Bresser in Cook County Circuit Court.\nAccording to the motion for stay, Bresser allegedly \"resigned abruptly\" from the Trent firm on Sept. 27. According to the motion, he had worked for the firm since 2021 after he was allegedly \"hired based on a recommendation and received extensive professional training and mentorship from Marc Trent, the firm's managing partner.\"\nThen, on Oct. 19, Bresser reportedly terminated the Trent firm as his attorneys in the case.\nAccording to the motion, this termination allegedly occurred after \"a settlement had already been reached, but before the disbursement of settlement funds.\"\nAccording to the motion, before he left the firm, Bresser allegedly also did not file a lien notice needed to ensure the Trent firm could secure attorney fees for their work in the case under the settlement.\nAccording to the motion, Bresser allegedly understood this lien notification to be a part of his job with the firm and allegedly \"falsely assured Trent that it had been completed.\"\n\"This omission jeopardized the Trent Law Firm's ability to recover its fees from the settlement,\" the Trent firm wrote in its motion.\nThe motion further accused Bresser of other alleged misconduct before he left the firm, \"including deleting digital files related to ongoing cases, altering office system passwords without providing the updated credentials, and misusing the firm's PACER account to print over 1,000 pages of unrelated documents.\" These actions allegedly resulted in the suspension of the firm's account to access the PACER system, which provides access to federal court documents.\nIn their motion, the Trent firm said it believes Bresser may have allegedly taken these alleged actions to \"retain a larger share of the settlement proceeds for himself.\"\nAccording to the motion, the Trent firm said it believes Bresser may have been dissatisfied with the amount of money the firm was extracting from the settlement as legal fees.\nAccording to the motion, the firm and Bresser have been unable to resolve their dispute outside of court.\nThe firm said it intends to file suit against Bresser in Cook County Circuit Court.\nThe Trent firm said that lawsuit \"is crucial to determining the validity of Trent Law Firm's fee claims and the extent of Bresser's alleged misconduct, which will directly affect the proceedings in this federal case.\"\nThe Trent firm asked the federal judge presiding over its case against the Bears to place that case on hold until it can resolve its dispute with Bresser.\n\"The stay would prevent any irreversible harm to Trent Law Firm’s interests if the Court avoids taking actions that could potentially undermine the state court’s resolution of key factual matters related to Bresser’s responsibilities and actions and avoid a premature adjudication of the case,\" the Trent firm said.\nNo notice of that termination has yet been filed on the case's docket in federal court, nor has any other attorney yet entered an appearance on Bresser's behalf.\nThe judge has not yet ruled on the stay request, but indicated on Oct. 23 that the parties were renewing settlement talks. The judge did not clearly state the new settlement conference was as a result of the Trent Law Firm's motion to pause proceedings.",

Support independent journalism by subscribing to our digital news package. Subscribe now In his defence,Tinos Ndebele said he was chasing a snake at the Telkom cellphone tower in Bloemfontein.\nImage: 123RF/ ALLAN SWART\nThe Bloemfontein regional court on Thursday sentenced a man who stole Telkom cellphone tower batteries worth R36,000 to 30 years imprisonment.\nTinos Ndebele was found guilty of tampering with essential infrastructure and theft from essential infrastructure.\nAn alarm was triggered at a Telkom cellphone tower in Roodewal in June last year. W hen Telkom officials went to investigate, they found fencing around the tower damaged, a container broken into and the door forced open. Twelve batteries worth R36,000 were stolen from the container.\nA police forensic team lifted fingerprints from the crime scene and matched them to Ndebele's.\n“In his defence during the trial, the accused gave a version that he was a snake catcher and on the said date he was chasing a king cobra. The snake went into the container, thus explaining his fingerprints found at the crime scene,” National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Mojalefa Senokoatsane said.\nProsecutor Petro van den Berg argued that the court should impose the maximum sentence on Ndebele as tampering with essential infrastructure offences was on the increase and harming the economy.\n“The accused was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment on a charge of tampering with infrastructure and 15 years’ imprisonment on a charge of theft from infrastructure.”\nThe court ordered that five years of the sentence for theft from infrastructure run concurrently with the 20-year sentence.\nTimesLIVE",

    "text": "The friendship between China and Bangladesh is expected to be enhanced after the two countries established a comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership on Wednesday during the latter's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to Beijing, experts say.\nThe visit, at the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Qiang, is \"a renewal of all the excellent relations of cooperation and friendship\" between the two countries, said Munshi Faiz Ahmad, Bangladesh's former ambassador to China.\nAhmad stressed the significance of Hasina's visit, her first to China since her new term began in January, and five years after her last visit to the country, saying Bangladesh's cooperation and friendship with China are continuously improving.\n\" (Bangladesh-China) cooperation has always been based on mutual benefit, mutual respect and mutual trust,\" Ahmad said. \"When countries in the region continue to prosper and do well, it is always a positive thing for regional peace and stability.\"\nMustafizur Rahman, a distinguished fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka, said the Bangladesh-China relationship \"is one of our defining partnerships\".\nIn the 49 years since establishing diplomatic ties, China and Bangladesh have achieved significant cooperation in various fields.\nChina has been Bangladesh's biggest trading partner for 13 consecutive years, and as of last year, Chinese investments in Bangladesh totaled $3.2 billion, ranking China as the country's second-largest source of foreign investment.\nAccording to the Chinese embassy, nearly 1,000 Chinese companies operate in Bangladesh, creating more than 550,000 job opportunities.\nBangladesh is keen to attract Chinese investment, Rahman said, adding that he believes a special economic zone for Chinese investors and a free-trade agreement between the two countries will be conducive to Bangladesh's economy.\nIn 2016, Bangladesh was the first country in South Asia to join China's Belt and Road Initiative.\nRahman said Bangladesh is also interested in key projects such as the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor, investment and trade and technology transfer.\nShahab Enam Khan, a professor of the Department of International Relations at the Jahangirnagar University in Dhaka, said not only will Bangladesh profit from Chinese investment, but other regional countries will also benefit from the shared economic effect and infrastructure connectivity.\n\"The Bangladesh-China relationship should not be seen through the myopic prism of geopolitics,\" Khan said. \"It should be seen through the prism of development and growth of the 170 million population in Bangladesh.\"\nPeople who criticize Bangladesh for falling into the \"debt trap\" of China need to see Bangladesh's growth momentum, Khan said.\nBilateral relationship will continue to grow because of common economic and market interests, Khan added.\nAbdus Salam Aref, president of the Association of Travel Agents of Bangladesh, said he hopes to see more investment from China in the tourism sector.\nIn May, ATAB co-organized a \"China Tourism Day\" promotion event. Aref said an increasing number of people in Bangladesh are becoming more interested in traveling to China.\nDuring Hasina's visit, the two countries agreed to designate next year as the \"China-Bangladesh Year of People-to-People Exchanges\".\nAref said people-to-people exchanges between Bangladesh and China will further grow with improved connectivity and more business cooperation.",

    "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. — The Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region (HSPPR) is only accepting emergency dog intakes for the next week after several dogs at its Colorado Springs location tested positive for strep zoo.\nAccording to the HSPPR, streptococcus zooepidemicus, also known as strep zoo, is a type of bacteria that can affect dogs. Symptoms typically include coughing, nasal discharge, vomiting, labored breathing and coughing blood.\nThe shelter said several dogs have tested positive for the bacteria. The infection was caught early, according to HSPPR, and there have been no fatal cases.\nHSPPR said the bacteria is spread through direct contact between dogs and contaminated objects, like shoes and bowls. It can be treated with antibiotics.\nDue to the presence of the bacteria, HSPPR is only accepting emergency dog intakes until Feb. 27. Emergency intakes include urgent medical cases or cases involving public safety.\nThe shelter is being deep cleaned, and all dogs at HSPPR are receiving prophylactic antibiotics. The Colorado Springs Wellness Clinic will also be closed for dog appointments for two weeks, according to HSPPR.\nThe shelter said owner surrender euthanasia services will continue.\nHSPPR said adoptions are still open. All adopted dogs will receive preventative treatment before leaving.\nIn the meantime, HSPPR is asking for donations to offset the \"significant\" cost of antibiotics. Donations can be made through this link.\nIf you find a stray, do not bring it to HSPPR. Instead, check for a microchip at a vet or the shelter's admissions entrance, but be sure to call ahead. The shelter is also asking people to house the stray and file a report on its website to reduce intake.\nBeloved brewery patio cut in half for parking as Denver eyes bigger changes\nLafayette's Rock Creek Curling hosts US Olympic Trials\nColorado lawmakers introduce bill to address misconduct at CBI crime lab\nCDPHE investigation reveals errors in water testing impacting five schools, child care facilities\nNew History Colorado exhibit will honor victims of United Flight 629 bombing\nDenver7 is committed to making a difference in our community by standing up for what's right, listening, lending a helping hand and following through on promises.
