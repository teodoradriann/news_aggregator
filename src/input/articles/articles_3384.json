    "title": "Everything you need to know about the betting scandal rocking the general election",
    "text": "Westminster has been rocked by allegations that senior Tories bet on the date of the general election before it was announced by Rishi Sunak. The Gambling Commission, an independent watchdog, has launched an investigation into whether party figures illicitly used insider knowledge. So far five Conservatives have been named as under investigation, as well as one Labour candidate who bet on the result in his own seat. Here The Telegraph walks you through the developing scandal. When did it start? The issue first came to public attention on June 12 when The Guardian reported that Craig Williams had placed a bet on the timing of the election. Mr Williams, who is the Prime Minister’s parliamentary private secretary, admitted having a “flutter” on the fact that the snap poll would be called in July. He reportedly placed a £100 wager on that fact at a bookmaker in his Welsh constituency three days before Mr Sunak announced the election date. The Conservatives have since withdrawn their support for Mr Williams, who will now appear on the ballot paper on July 4 as an independent candidate. Who is involved? It has since emerged that four other Conservatives are being investigated for betting on the election. The Gambling Commission is investigating Tony Lee, the party’s director of campaigning, and Laura Saunders, his wife who was the Tory candidate in Bristol North West. Like Mr Williams, the party has since removed its support from Ms Saunders. Nick Mason, its chief data officer, has taken a leave of absence following the Gambling Commission to investigate him. Allegations have also been made against Russell George, a Tory member of the devolved Welsh parliament. Three other Conservatives are reported to have bet on the election. But they are not under investigation by the watchdog because they are not accused of using inside information to do so. Alister Jack, the secretary of state for Scotland, has admitted that he placed three bets on the date of the election earlier this year, winning one and losing two. Kevin Hollinrake, the business minister, said on Thursday that he had bet on the Tories winning the election but not on the seat where he is running. Meanwhile, Sir Philip Davies, who is standing for re-election in Shipley, has not denied placing an £8,000 bet that he would lose the seat at the election. Liam Booth-Smith, Rishi Sunak’s chief of staff, has been interviewed as a witness by the Gambling Commission but he is not suspected of placing any bets himself. Is anyone else involved? The Labour Party has also been dragged into the scandal after suspending a candidate who wagered that he would lose his seat. Kevin Craig, who was due to stand for Sir Keir Starmer’s party in Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, said he had planned to give the winnings to local charities. The Metropolitan Police has also confirmed that the Gambling Commission is looking at five more police officers over election bets after one from Rishi Sunak’s close protection team was arrested. Who is investigating? The Conservatives are conducting an internal investigation into their own candidates. But probes are also being carried out by the Gambling Commission and the Metropolitan Police. Scotland Yard has taken control of a number of criminal investigations into the scandal. The force said on Wednesday that it will take charge of a small number of cases where offences such as misconduct in public office are alleged to have been committed. The Gambling Commission is continuing its own investigations into offences which are alleged to have breached the Gambling Act, under which it is illegal to use inside information to place a bet. Inside information is information which is known by an individual or individuals as a result of their role in connection with an event, and which is not in the public domain. “If someone uses confidential information in order to gain an unfair advantage when betting, this may constitute an offence of cheating under Section 42 of the Gambling Act, which is a criminal offence,” the act says. What is the punishment for using inside information? It is therefore a potential criminal offence to place a bet on something when you already know the outcome thanks to information that is not in the public domain. Those found guilty could face up to two years in prison, a fine, or both. In many cases, the Gambling Commission deems sanctions imposed by a sports governing body or the confiscation of winnings by a betting operator to be proportionate.",
