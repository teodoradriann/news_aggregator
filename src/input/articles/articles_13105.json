    "title": "Florida is no place for a pediatric conference, when DeSantis is hostile to gender-diverse youth",
    "text": "Florida is no place for a pediatric conference, when DeSantis is hostile to gender-diverse youth\nA member of the American Academy of Pediatrics asks why an organization that calls itself an advocate for all kids would have its convention in Florida when Gov. Ron DeSantis supports legislation hostile to LGBTQIA+ youth.\nThe\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, headquartered in suburban Chicago, has historically positioned itself as an advocate for all kids, including LGBTQIA+ (also referred to as gender-diverse) youth. It is, therefore, unacceptable that this organization, with more than 67,000 members, would choose to hold its 2024 annual convention in Florida — a state whose governor sits at the forefront of supporting legislation hostile to gender-diverse youth.\nAs a professor of pediatrics, I train pediatric residents on how best to care for all children and adolescents. We know that some youth become aware of discordance between their assigned gender at birth and how they view themselves as early as age 8. Once they decide to share their gender identity, these youth are at increased risk of parental rejection, stigmatization, homelessness, interpersonal violence and bullying. Some of this bullying is perpetuated by those with significant power, including governors and a U.S. president.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis touted his legislative “accomplishments” throughout his failed run for president. Some even attributed his early aggressive positions against gender-diverse youth as advantaging him in the Republican primaries. As a father and pediatrician, I find it abhorrent for any politician to build their campaign on the hurt and suffering of others, particularly kids.\nSEND LETTERS TO: letters@suntimes.com. To be considered for publication, letters must include your full name, your neighborhood or hometown and a phone number for verification purposes. Letters should be a maximum of approximately 375 words.\nAs harshly as history may judge him, such criticism may appropriately come to those who are aware of the many challenges gender-diverse youth face, and have even historically advocated on their behalf, only to then support the very institutions that perpetuate the challenges against which their advocacy efforts are targeted. To that end, it is glaringly inconsistent that the AAP will hold its annual conference in Orlando.\nBecause I serve as one of the editors of AAP’s flagship journal Pediatrics, I am obligated to attend this conference. But I do so with deep sadness and anger. We must ask ourselves a tough question — whether we wish to be complicit in throwing our gender-diverse youth under DeSantis’ bus.\nAs we commemorate Pride month, how we answer that question will say a great deal about our own moral integrity and, more importantly, may have implications for how trusting our gender-diverse patient population is of us.\nDavid Myles, M.D., board-certified general pediatrician, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and fellow, American Academy of Pediatrics\nEasy to avoid billboards\nWith regard to the spot-on\nSun-Times editorial about the possible pollution of the Chicago River by digital advertising billboards, I have a solution I have adopted: I never l patronize any business that uses billboards, digital or otherwise.\nSandra Minor, McHenry\nNot the Chicago many remember\nAs a resident of Chicago since the age of 6 who never officially left the city or state (I’m currently 51), I can say that the city is at one of the lowest points I ever remember.\nThe murder of that precious\n7-year-old child was the breaking point for me. I had to speak up after hearing Mayor Brandon Johnson ask the questions that he broached to the inhabitants of this great city: “What kind of city do you want to live in?” I couldn’t help but think to myself, “That kind of city that used to exist here.” Then, my question became, “What happened to that city that I and so many of friends and associates grew up in?”\nThe worst part of this for me was that I couldn’t pinpoint one particular thing. I guess it is correct that you need an entire community to keep a neighborhood together, and when we lose all of the aforementioned things, community, neighborhoods and families, then we lose society as a whole.\nTangela Swain, Austin\nWe have a cleaning problem\nLast week, around 50,000 design professionals descended on downtown Chicago for NeoCon and Fulton Market Design Days, two of the largest and most prominent design events in the world. On the tail of NeoCon, we convened a workshop representing suppliers, manufacturers, designers, scientists and policy advocates, and everyone unanimously agreed: we have a cleaning problem.\nFollowing COVID-19, people are still fanatical about cleaning. Although this sounds like a good thing, the improper use of cleaning and disinfection products is bad for humans, the environment and even the products we’re trying to clean.\nFirst and foremost, cleaning is not disinfection. While health care teams might be aware of this, most people are not. And, we have heard repeatedly from designers that clients don’t listen. Even when professionals make recommendations for how to clean furniture and indoor surfaces, people rarely follow those instructions.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides guidance on\ncleaning vs. disinfecting. In the vast majority of cases, surfaces need to be cleaned, not disinfected. Using a disinfectant will likely do more harm than good.\nImproper use of cleaning and disinfection products can lead to\nimmediate, acute harms (including skin burns, eye irritation, organ damage and even death) to the people applying them and possibly others who later make contact with the residual disinfectant. Overuse can lead to antimicrobial resistance. And it likely damages the integrity of the surface they are applied to, particularly textiles.\nAll surfaces,\neven textiles with added antimicrobials, need to be cleaned. One might think that using the strongest cleaning product or disinfectant makes our surrounding environment safer and healthier. Instead, it causes unnecessary exposure to hazardous chemicals and results in excessive damage to surfaces, especially upholstered furniture.\nIf you’re a designer headed home with visions of beautifully finished interiors, make sure you check with the manufacturer on the best cleaning practices and communicate that to your client. And all of us, whether at work or at home, need to\ngo easy on the harsh disinfectants and always read the label.\nErica Hartmann, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering, Northwestern University\nSuzanne Drake, senior designer and director of sustainability, Revel Architecture & Design",

    "title": "Castellón, Teruel y Tarragona estarán hoy amenazados por tormentas muy fuertes, según Meteored",
    "text": "MADRID, 1 (EUROPA PRESS)\nCastellón, Teruel y Tarragona están amenazados por sistemas de tormentas con lluvias muy fuertes, que podrían dejar más de 40 o 60 litros por metro cuadrado (l/m2) en una hora en algunos sectores entre la confluencia de estas tres provincias, según la previsión del divulgador Samuel Biener en Meteored.\nTal y como ha detallado Biener, Castellón ha amanecido este jueves con un sistema convectivo estático que está repartiendo precipitaciones y tormentas muy intensas, regenerándose continuamente, algo que ya ha sucedido en estos pasados días en otros puntos de España. De acuerdo con las últimas actualizaciones del modelo de referencia del portal meteorológico, el sistema convectivo seguirá dejando lluvias torrenciales durante las próximas horas en las comarcas del norte de Castellón y se propagará hacia el noreste de Teruel y el sur de Tarragona.\nDe cara a la tarde, Biener ha indicado que las precipitaciones tenderán a concentrarse en este último punto. Tras eso, a últimas horas del día y de cara a la próxima madrugada, crecerán una vez más nuevas células tormentosas que de nuevo golpearán a las comarcas del norte de Castellón. En este sentido, el experto ha advertido de que el modelo de cabecera de Meteored avisa de que en esta nueva tanda localmente podrían pasar de los 100-150 l/m2.\nCon el paso de las horas, estas lluvias tan intensas tenderían a desplazarse hacia el delta del Ebro y a otras zonas de la provincia de Tarragona. Además de las fuertes lluvias, Biener espera varios fenómenos adversos como rachas de viento asociadas a estas estructuras convectivas pueden ser localmente intensas. Asimismo, señala que el Laboratorio Europeo de Tormentas Severas avisa de una pequeña probabilidad de que pueda caer granizo grande (de dos centímetros) en el entorno del golfo de Valencia.",
