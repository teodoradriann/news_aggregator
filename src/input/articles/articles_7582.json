(KAIT) - A tree planted in Poinsett County honors cancer patients, survivors, and loved ones who lost their lives fighting the disease.\nA proclamation from Mayor Jay Paul Woods deems April 23, 2025, as Arbor Day to support efforts to protect trees and woodlands in the city of Trumann.\nStudents, teachers, and city officials gathered around a new tree planted at Trumann Elementary School, where fourth-grade teacher Chea Palmer is actively going through breast cancer treatment.\nPalmer said doctors caught it early, but she encourages all women to get mammograms regularly.\n“I was diagnosed with stage one breast cancer in January, and I had a double mastectomy at the end of February,” Palmer said. “And so far, I’m showing cancer-free.”\nGrown with gratitude and never forgotten, the city said the tree symbolizes strength in the face of struggle, healing through hope, and love that never fades.\nTo report a typo or correction, please click here.\nCopyright 2025 KAIT.

This is reported by ISW, UNN reports. Details Ukrainian forces were forced to retreat from their limited positions in the Pokrovsk sector after a recent advance by enemy troops. Although the occupiers captured Ptyche and advanced further south, they were unable to reach the tactical encirclement of Ukrainian forces as planned.

The Baltimore Ravens quarterback's career-best rushing performance propelled his team to a crucial victory in Week 17 in the NFL. Steelers make final decision about Russell Wilson's contract and future Bengals' Joe Burrow might be without a key weapon against the Broncos By Santiago Tovar\nDecember 26, 2024 04:39PM EDT\nDecember 26, 2024 04:39PM EDT\n© IMAGO / ZUMA Press Wire Owings Mills, Md, USA: Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson (8) during a practice session at the Under Armour Performance Center on Dec 23, 2024, in Owings Mills, Maryland. By Santiago Tovar\nBaltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson , renowned for his electric speed that disrupts game plans, outdid even himself during their recent matchup against the Houston Texans . Jackson, a player who stands out for his mobility among NFL quarterbacks, clocked the fastest speed of his career on the field.\nWhile official figures weren’t immediately available from the Ravens, reports suggest Jackson surpassed 21 miles per hour during his electrifying 48-yard touchdown run against Houston . This impressive feat not only shatters his personal record but further cements his status as one of the league’s fastest players, regardless of position.\nThe media, naturally intrigued, bombarded Jackson with questions about his record-breaking speed and its significance. However, his response was laced with humor, catching everyone by surprise. “I was jogging,” Jackson chuckled, then playfully redirected the question back to the reporters, “I didn’t have to do anything, but that was cool.”\nAdvertisement Advertisement This performance raises a crucial question: can Jackson maintain this explosive level of athleticism throughout the season? Given the grueling nature of NFL competition, staying healthy is absolutely critical.\nRavens Nation 𝙇𝙄𝙑𝙀\n@LIVERavenNation · Follow\nLAMAR JACKSON. MVP IS OVER.

    "title": "How two scientists are using language models to democratize climate data in Morocco",
    "text": "Beginning with an inquiry on Morocco, two German scientists developed ClimSight, a tool based on language models to assist in quickly and inexpensively summarizing, aggregating, and communicating localized climate-related data to people. They say that a straightforward proof-of-concept prototype could support the claim that the method of combining language models with crop-related climate predictions has the potential to effectively democratize climate information. “Consider an individual who owns a parcel of land in Morocco and contemplates its use for wheat cultivation. They are aware of changes in the climate, and concerned regarding potential impacts on their agricultural venture,” said the scientists in the research published in Nature Science magazine. What might sharing climate information look like in the future? [@JungAwi]and I are experimenting with an AI-based approach that could potentially bring local climate information from projects like [#DestinE]to everyone. Published today in [@CommsEarth]: [https://t.co/aOWB7Vv1Co] 1/3 [pic.twitter.com/TBC7rSA71Y] — Nikolay Koldunov @ [[email protected]](@oceanographer) [January 5, 2024] They set ClimSight to work on a query about a specific geographical point, “I intend to cultivate wheat. What are the implications of climate change?” With the help of a large language model (LLM), ClimSight serves as a localized decision-making assistant that evaluates the impact of climate change on specific activities, after providing a thorough answer to the query. Despite being a scientific breakthrough, ClimSight is still rather basic; it only collects a limited amount of information about the area of interest, relies solely on the output of a single, low-resolution climate model simulation, and ignores uncertainty estimates. The two scientists, Thomas Jung, and Nikolay Koldunov believe that it is likely that the majority of users will be curious about climate impacts over the next ten to thirty years, which is why the tool tries to foresee future climate scenarios. ClimSight links user queries to climate change information and demonstrates a high degree of proficiency in conveying and summarizing climate data. In response to the test on Morocco, the tool gave insights on temperature, precipitation, wind, policy, and regulatory implications as well as recommendations aligning perfectly with the climate predictions it offers. It also delves into potential risks and helps the inquirers to figure out their next step. As the technology used to provide information to the tool isn’t free of constraints, the scientists hope to expand the scope of their system and transition to open-source models instead of the large language models they are currently using. ClilSight’s creators, very aware of the risks that come with using AI in such a project, said “ Arguably more important than expansion, is the task of ensuring that users are aware of the degree of reliability of the information they receive. Large language models can occasionally generate erroneous information and fabricate facts, and climate projections are subject to their own set of inherent uncertainties and potential biases. It would be important to make the reliability of the system’s output intuitively transparent, for example by providing a range of possible future scenarios rather than just one recommendation. Furthermore, incorporating information on local model biases, drift, and ensemble spread would add confidence and trustworthiness to the recommendations communicated to the user.”",

    "title": "'Nuvens arco-íris' coloriram os céus do Ártico por 3 dias",
    "text": "No frio intenso do Ártico um espetáculo raro de nuvens estratosféricas polares (PCSs, na sigla em inglês) transformou os céus em uma explosão de cores, iluminando a região por três dias consecutivos, entre 18 e 20 de dezembro. Conhecidas como 'nuvens nacaradas', essas maravilhas celestiais, que parecem saídas de um sonho ou de um filme, surgiram devido a uma onda de frio incomum na atmosfera superior.\nAs nuvens, feitas de minúsculos cristais de gelo que refratam a luz solar, criaram um arco-íris deslumbrante que se estendeu pelos céus da Noruega, Suécia, Finlândia, Alasca e o sul da Escócia. O fenômeno, capturado pelas lentes talentosas da fotógrafa norueguesa Ramune Šapailaite, revelou uma paleta de cores iridescentes (coloridas, como um arco-íris), proporcionando um evento espetacular.\nNuvens brilhantes Céu no Círculo Polar Ártico ficou extremamente brilhante no final de dezembro. (Fonte: Ramune Šapailaite - Facebook/ Divulgação)\nAs nuvens nacaradas são uma raridade, formando-se entre 15 e 25 quilômetros acima da superfície terrestre. Em climas extremamente frios, pequenos cristais de gelo se agrupam, dispersando a luz solar e criando essas maravilhas cintilantes. Para a formação desse fenômeno, a temperatura tem de estar extremamente baixa, algo próximo a -85 °C.\nRamune Šapailaite, que testemunhou e fotografou o fenômeno sobre Gran, no sul da Noruega, descreveu as cores como \"espetaculares\", enfatizando que a explosão de tons acontecia especialmente nos momentos que antecediam o pôr do sol .\nOs especialistas dizem que as nuvens nacaradas que brilharam nos céus do Ártico são classificadas como sendo do Tipo II. Essas nuvens, do Tipo II, são compostas por cristais de gelo puros, resultando em cores mais vibrantes do que as nuvens do Tipo I, que são perigosas e podem afetar a camada de ozônio.\nEl Niño e Mudanças Climáticas Nuvens estratosféricas polares são extremamente coloridas e fazem um belo espetáculo. (Fonte: Ramune Šapailaite - Facebook/ Divulgação)\nA formação excepcional dessas nuvens está intrinsecamente ligada a condições climáticas específicas. A estratosfera seca normalmente não permite a formação de nuvens, mas em temperaturas extremamente baixas, o Ártico se transforma em um palco para esse espetáculo raro.\nDe acordo com os especialistas, a recente onda de frio que desencadeou a aparição precoce das nuvens nacaradas possivelmente teve influência do já conhecido El Niño . Contudo, eles apontam também para a influência de outro agente: a mudança climática gerada pelo homem.\nNormalmente, as nuvens estratosféricas polares costumam ocorrer em raros dias no inverno, tendo o início das aparições ocorrendo no mês de janeiro. No entanto, os cientistas acreditam que como esse fenômeno aconteceu antes do previsto e por três dias seguidos, deve ser um sinal de que haverá mais eventos magníficos como esse durante o ano.\nA beleza efêmera dessas nuvens adiciona uma dose extra de magia à temporada, já que o Ártico é um ponto turístico importante para aqueles que querem ver de perto o fenômeno da aurora boreal.",
