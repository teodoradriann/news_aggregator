    "text": "On Sept. 12, Brentwood Assistant Police Chief Jim Colvin graduated from the elite FBI National Academy in Quantico, Virginia. The 291st session of the National Academy consisted of 254 men and women from 47 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam. Colvin was only the third person from the Brentwood Police Department (BPD) to attend the academy, and he joined some of the best police officers from around the world for the 10-week program. The class included members of law enforcement agencies from 26 countries, seven military organizations, and seven federal civilian organizations. Colvin joined the BPD in December 2004, serving over the last 20 years as a patrol sergeant, a detective, a patrol lieutenant, and a captain over the City’s Patrol Division. In 2022, he was named assistant chief of police. On March 1, 2025, Colvin will become the city’s fifth Chief of Police. He will take over the role from Richard Hickey, a fellow FBI National Academy alumnus, who is retiring on Feb. 25, 2025. Internationally known for its academic excellence, the National Academy offers 10 weeks of advanced communication, leadership, and fitness training. Participants must have proven records as professionals within their agencies to attend. On average, these officers have 21 years of law enforcement experience and usually return to their agencies to serve in executive-level positions. FBI Director Christopher Wray (pictured with Colvin) delivered remarks at the ceremony. FBI Academy instructors, special agents, and other staff with advanced degrees provide the training; many instructors are recognized internationally in their fields. Since 1972, National Academy students have been able to earn undergraduate and graduate credits from the University of Virginia, which accredits all the National Academy courses offered. A total of 55,440 graduates have completed the FBI National Academy since it began in 1935. The National Academy is held at the FBI Training Academy in Quantico, the same facility where the FBI trains its new special agents and intelligence analysts. Please join our FREE Newsletter",

    "title": "VICTOR DAVIS HANSON: Stop The Ukrainian Meat Grinder?",
    "text": "Nearly eleven months ago, in August 2023, The New York Times reported that U.S. officials had estimated that some 500,000 Russians and Ukrainians had been killed, wounded or missing in the then 18-month Ukrainian War.\nBoth Russia and Ukraine underreport their losses. Hundreds of thousands of additional casualties have followed in the 28 months of fighting.\nIn the West, the mere mention of a negotiated settlement is considered a dangerous appeasement of Russia’s flagrant aggression. In Russia, anything short of victory would be seen as synonymous with the collapse of the Putin regime.\nYet as the war nears two and a half years this summer, some facts are no longer much in dispute.\nControversy still arises over the circumstances of the 2014 overthrow of Ukraine’s pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych.\nRussia charges that the West engineered the “Revolution of Dignity” — an effort to Westernize the former Soviet republic, to expand the borders of Europe right to the doorstep of Russia and eventually to fully arm Ukraine as a member of NATO.\nWesterners counter that most Ukrainians wished to be part of Europe and independent from Russian bullying — and they had a perfect right to ask to join either NATO or the E.U. or both despite anticipated escalating tensions.\nAfter the heroic Ukrainian defeat of the 2022 Russian bid to take Kyiv, there have been few significant territorial gains by either side.\nLike the seesaw bloodbath on the Western Front of World War I, neither side has developed the momentum to force the other to negotiate or grant concessions.\nAs nuclear Russian threats against Europe mount, NATO is seeking to regain deterrence capabilities by boosting defense budgets, incorporating robust frontline nations Sweden and Finland and uniting over shared concerns about Russian aggression.\nMany in the U.S. cheer on the conflict as a necessary proxy war to check Russian aggression and bolster NATO’s resistance.\nBut unlike third-party wars during the Cold War, now the Western client, Ukraine, is fighting directly against the chief antagonist of European NATO members.\nArming a proxy in a war waged against the homeland of a nuclear adversary is a new and dangerous phenomenon.\nThe West counts on supplying Ukraine with more and better weapons than a richer, larger and more populous Russia.\nBut Ukraine’s problem is not so much weapons as manpower. Nearly a fourth of Ukraine’s population has fled the country.\nUkraine may have suffered some 300,000 causalities. The average age of its soldiers is over 40 years. It already lacks sufficient forces to replay the failed 2023 counter-offensive. The Russian plan of attrition is to wear down and bleed out the Ukrainian people.\nIn a geostrategic sense, the new alignment of Russia, China, Iran and North Korea is starting to gain opportunistic support from illiberal Middle East regimes, Turkey and the Islamic world in general.\nThe Biden administration’s respective approaches to the Ukraine and Gaza wars continue to be utterly incoherent.\nIt lectures our strongest ally Israel on the need for a ceasefire, proportionality, a coalition wartime cabinet and the avoidance of collateral damage. The administration considers the terrorist group Hamas almost a legitimate state.\nHowever, Biden and the American diplomatic establishment urge Ukraine to keep fighting without negotiations. They urge Kyiv to seek critical disproportionality through superior weaponry, including hitting strategic targets inside Russia.\nThe U.S. has overlooked the cancellation of Ukrainian political parties and elections by the Zelenskyy administration. America does not seem to care about Ukrainian collateral damage to the borderlands. And it considers the Russian government a near-terrorist state.\nNo one in the West, at least prior to the Russian February 2022 invasion — neither the prior Obama, Trump, and current Biden administrations or the Ukrainian government itself — had considered it even possible to regain by force Crimea and the Donbass absorbed by the Russian invasion of 2014.\nAdd up all these realities, and the only practicable way to avoid another near-one million dead and wounded would be a settlement, however unpopular.\nIt would entail the formalization of the 2014 Russian absorption of Crimea and Donbass.\nRussia would then agree to withdraw all its forces to its pre-2022 borders. Ukraine would be fully armed but without NATO membership.\nBoth sides would agree to a demilitarized zone on both sides of the Russian-Ukrainian border. Russia would brag that it prevented its former province from joining NATO while finally institutionalizing its prior incorporation of the Donbass and Crimea.\nUkraine would be proud that, like heroic 1940 Finland, it miraculously stopped Russian aggression. It would remain far better armed than at any time in its history and soon enjoy a status similar to that of non-NATO Austria or Switzerland.\nThe deal would anger all parties. But it would make public what most concede privately — and stop the ongoing destruction of Ukraine and the further slaughter of an entire generation of Ukrainian and Russian youth.\nVictor Davis Hanson is a distinguished fellow of the Center for American Greatness.
