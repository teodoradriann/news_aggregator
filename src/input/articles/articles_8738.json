    "text": "le parole\nUcraina: il Papa elogia “chi ha il coraggio della bandiera bianca”\n\"Quando vedi che sei sconfitto, che le cose non vanno, occorre avere il coraggio di negoziare\", ha detto il Pontefice in un'intervista a RSI, ricordando di essersi proposto come mediatore: \"Io sono qui\"\n\"Credo che è più forte chi vede la situazione, chi pensa al popolo, chi ha il coraggio della bandiera bianca, di negoziare. E oggi si può negoziare con l'aiuto delle potenze internazionali. La parola negoziare è una parola coraggiosa\". Lo ha affermato Papa Francesco in un'intervista rilasciata a Radio Televisione Svizzera (RSI), che andrà in onda il 20 marzo, riferendosi al\nconflitto in corso fra Russia e Ucraina.\n\"Quando vedi che sei sconfitto, che le cose non vanno – ha aggiunto Francesco – occorre avere il coraggio di negoziare. Hai vergogna, ma con quante morti finirà? Negoziare in tempo, cercare qualche Paese che faccia da mediatore. Oggi, per esempio nella guerra in Ucraina, ci sono tanti che vogliono fare da mediatore. La Turchia, si è offerta per questo. E altri. Non abbiate vergogna di negoziare prima che la cosa sia peggiore\".\nPer Francesco non bisogna perdere la speranza di provare a mediare: \"Guardiamo la storia, le guerre che noi abbiamo vissuto, tutte finiscono con l'accordo\". Poi Papa Francesco ha ricordato che lui stesso si è proposto per negoziare: \"Io sono qui, punto. Ho inviato una lettera agli ebrei di Israele, per riflettere su questa situazione. Il negoziato non è mai una resa. E' il coraggio per non portare il Paese al suicidio. Gli ucraini, con la storia che hanno, poveretti, gli ucraini al tempo di Stalin quanto hanno sofferto...\".\nin francia\nParigi si fa centro della strategia militare europea, anche con l'IA\nLo stato dell'Unione\nChe fierezza, Mr Biden\nIl presidente americano lancia un messaggio limpido e battagliero: difenderà la democrazia e la libertà in America e nel mondo. I duelli improvvisati con i repubblicani (pareva di stare ai Comuni di Londra), le smorfie dello speaker del Congresso e la frase più bella detta agli eversori del 6 gennaio: \"Non puoi amare il tuo paese soltanto quando vinci\"",

    "text": "You’ve probably come across olive oil on a salad or drizzled over a fresh pizza.

Keep reading to learn some fun facts about olive oil!\nOlive oil is produced on six continents.\nMediterranean countries are the main homes of olive oil, but many other countries produce it, too.\nSome olive oil is produced in New Zealand, South America, and Australia, where the climates are warm and dry.\nOlive oil is even produced in the United States, thanks to the warm weather in California .\nThis U.S. state has the perfect conditions to grow delicious olives, like Mission olives, that are used to make olive oil.\nHowever, the most popular producer of olive oil is Spain, followed by other Mediterranean countries, such as Greece and Italy.\nOlive oil has been used for more than 6,000 years.\nPeople discovered olive oil in the Middle East and started using it for medicines, skin treatment, and lighting their oil lamps.\nThe first written records of olive oil emerged in 400 B.C. when traders began keeping track of their goods in ancient Europe. Some records show that olive oil was being traded across borders in ships.\nThe olive oil trade has grown considerably over the years to become one of today’s most popular oils.\nIt takes 3-5 years for an olive tree to begin producing olives.\nIf you want to start making your own olive oil, you’ll need the right weather and a lot of patience! It will take a few years after planting an olive tree before you see any olives.\nOlives grow throughout the summer and fall. Unlike many other plants that are ready in the summer, olives are usually ready for harvest from fall through to winter.\nThey are completely ripe when they begin to turn black and fall off the olive tree naturally.\nOlive oil inspired a character in Popeye the Sailor.\nPopeye’s girlfriend, Olive Oyl, became a popular character in the Popeye universe.\nOlive was created by Elzie Crisler Segar in 1919 but didn’t become well-known until the 1930s when the Popeye the Sailor cartoons began.\nIn the long-running cartoon shorts, Olive Oyl was voiced by Mae Questel.\nThe character’s voice and mannerisms were based on American silent movie actress and comedienne ZaSu Pitts, who was famous for her big eyes and dramatic hand gestures.\nThere are more than 800 million olive trees!\nThere needs to be a lot of olive trees to keep up with the massive global demand for olive oil! Around the world, millions of olive groves support the mass production of this popular product.\nOlive trees cannot be planted close to each other, however, so you need plenty of space to grow them.\nYou should leave around 20 feet (6 meters) of space in between the trees , as they will grow outwards and take up more space as they get bigger.\nThe name “Kalamata Olive” has protected status in the European Union.\nIf you’re an olive fan, you’ve probably tucked into a bowl of tasty Kalamata olives at some point in your life.\nThese dark purple and black olives are among the most well-known and are produced in the city of Kalamata, Greece.\nThey are so special that the European Union gave them “Protected Designation of Origin” status.\nThis means that olives can only be called Kalamata olives if they have come from this specific region of Greece .\nOlive oil soap could help reduce acne and skin conditions.\nPeople with sensitive skin or conditions like acne could see benefits from using olive oil. As well as being full of vitamins like A, D, K, and E, olive oil can also kill bacteria.\nSince acne is caused by bacteria on your skin, using soaps and shampoos made from olive oil can help combat this.\nIt will also keep your skin moisturized and hydrated, preventing dryness that could lead to further skin problems.\nItaly and the United States are the biggest importers of olive oil.\nOlive oil from other countries is hugely popular in Italy and the United States. Italians import around 22% of global olive oil supplies in a year, while Americans import around 18.5%.\nThese sales convert to billions of dollars spent on olive oil, with Italy spending more than $2 billion and the United States over $1.8 billion.\nAround the world, more than $10 billion is spent every year on olive oil imports!\nOlive oil is used for massage therapy.\nOlive oil might be thought of as a kitchen product, but it can also be used for a relaxing massage!\nLike many oils, olive oil can help to soothe your skin after a long day. The ancient Greeks used this oil to help relax their muscles and prevent sports injuries!\nOlive oil may help to promote healthy skin and make you look younger.\nIt can encourage your skin to stay more elastic and firm as you age, reducing the appearance of wrinkles or sagging skin.\nOlive oil is mentioned in the Bible.\nThere are accounts in the Bible of olive oil being used to anoint kings, priests, and prophets.\nChristians believe it represents the blessing of God since it was used in religious ceremonies and rituals.\nIn the Biblical story of the Good Samaritan, a kind-hearted person stops to help a wounded traveler.\nHe uses olive oil to soothe and heal his wounds before taking him to an inn where he is cared for.\nThere is an international prize for writing about olive oil.\nOlive oil superfans can try their hand at winning the Ranieri Filo della Torre prize in Italy. This annual international prize was first awarded in 2017 and aims to promote extra virgin olive oil in literature.\nIt is named after the late Ranieri Filo della Torre, the general manager of a large Italian olive oil company.\nThe competition is open to anybody who wants to write about extra virgin olive oil. Writers can submit poems, short stories, and even scientific papers on the subject.\nMakeup can be removed with olive oil.\nIf you ever need to remove your makeup and don’t have your usual products, check your kitchen for olive oil! This versatile oil can easily wipe your makeup off after a long day.\nOlive oil can quickly remove even the toughest makeup products, such as thick mascara and eyeliner.\nJust remember to fully cleanse your face afterward to avoid a build-up of oil that could clog your pores.\nThe International Olive Council is a group of governments that discuss olive oil.\nFounded in 1959, the original members of the International Olive Council include Spain, Greece, Italy, France , and the United Kingdom. Until 2006, it was known as the International Olive Oil Council.\nToday, more than 20 countries are members of the Council. They meet to discuss the challenges facing olive oil production and how to contribute to responsible trade.\nThey even run campaigns to encourage more people around the world to consume olive oil!\nExtra virgin olive oil is the purest olive oil you can find.\nThe reason why some olive oils are called “virgin” or even “extra virgin” is because they are the least processed.\nThis means that they have kept as many of their natural vitamins and antioxidants as possible. Extra virgin olive oil is the highest and best quality grade of olive oil available.\nAs a result, these olive oils are purer and healthier than others. They also come with a higher price tag, so if you wonder why you’re paying a few extra dollars, check the label carefully!\nOlive oil is 100% fat.\nIf you’re trying to diet, you might be put off by this olive oil fact. Fear not, though, as olive oil is full of healthy monounsaturated fats.\nStudies have shown that people who ate diets high in monounsaturated fats had more success losing weight compared to people on other diets.\nJust one tablespoon (0.5 oz) of olive oil has 120 calories, and this rich food goes a long way when drizzled over your salad or pasta .\nYou don’t need to eat much of it to enjoy its rich and nutritious benefits!\nDid you ever think that olive oil was so popular? This oil has been around for thousands of years and has found its way to kitchens, massage tables, and makeup cabinets!\nThere are millions of people who eat it, write about it, and promote it around the world.\nNext time you add some olive oil to your salad, you might remember some of these surprising facts.",

    "text": "El emotivo mensaje de despedida de Juanfer Quintero a Racing: \"Gracias por convertirme en el campeón de América\"\nA poco más de una semana de su conflictiva salida, el colombiano le dijo adiós a la Academia y los hinchas con un sentido video en su cuenta de Instagram.\nJuan Fernando Quintero fue uno de los mejores jugadores de Racing en 2024, habiéndole aportado una cuota de calidad que muy pocos futbolistas pueden dar en el fútbol argentino o sudamericano. Sus rendimientos fueron clave para la obtención de la Copa Sudamericana (especialmente en la semifinal ante Corinthians) y, cuando no pudo jugar, sus ausencias se hicieron notar.\nSu salida en este 2025 para volver a Colombia y estar más cerca de su familia fue de las más sensibles que sufrió la Academia en este mercado de pases. De hecho, la forma en la que se fue terminó siendo un tanto problemática y generó cierto malestar entre los hinchas y los dirigentes. Como una historia breve pero tan linda no podía terminar de esa manera, el volante de 31 años decidió despedirse este jueves del club con un emotivo video en su cuenta de Instagram.\nLa despedida de Juanfer Quintero a Racing\n\"Querida familia de Racing, ha llegado el momento de despedirme de ustedes. Cada partido en el Cilindro fue especial, esa pasión única que se vive en Avellaneda, la llevaré con cariño a todos lados que viva. Los goles y las victorias las vivimos como uno solo. Pero sin duda alguna, el apoyo que me dieron durante los momentos más duros de mi vida, es algo que nunca me voy a olvidar. Y jamás encontraré las palabras para agradecerles por tanto\", comienza a relatar Juanfer en off mientras de fondo se ven muchas de sus mejores jugadas con la camiseta blanquiceleste.\n\"Me voy con la frente en alto, orgulloso de haber defendido estos colores y donde sea que me lleve el fútbol, seré un embajador de la grandeza de Racing\", asegura a continuación. Y cierra con un último agradecimiento: \"Ah, sí, una última cosa, gracias por convertirme en el campeón de América\", concluye el colombiano, con una imagen suya levantando la Sudamericana.\nQuintero llegó a Avellaneda a mediados de 2023 bajo la dirección técnica de Fernando Gago, proveniente de Junior de Barranquilla. En el año y medio que estuvo en la Academia, llegó a disputar unos 54 partidos, en los que convirtió 13 goles y dio 11 asistencias. A partir de ahora, continuará su carrera en el América de Cali.",

    "text": "La selección ecuatoriana de fútbol le ganó 3-0 a Colombia, en el primer partido del Preolímpico, gracias a los goles de Yaimar Medina (doblete) y Cristopher Zambrano.\nEcuador arrancó con pie derecho su participación en el\nPreolímpico ante un rival durísimo, que complicó durante los 90' con un jugador menos.\nLos dirigidos por Miguel Bravo tuvieron un buen inicio de partido, con aproximaciones y transiciones rápidas de defensa a ataque.\nPedro Vite fue el motor de Ecuador en el mediocampo. Atrajo marcas y liberó espacios. Fue el más movedizo y desequilibrante.\nAunque la Tricolor generó ocasiones de gol, el delantero Justin Cuero no estuvo fino a la hora de concretar.\nMientras que en el segundo tiempo, Colombia se adelantó en la cancha y fue mucho más agresivo de tres cuartos de cancha hacia adelante.\nPero el arquero ecuatoriano\nAlexis Villa respondió con mucha solvencia y tuvo atajadas clave.\nEcuador abrió el marcador a los 71 minutos, tras una asistencia impecable de Vite a Yaimar Medina, quien recibió en el área chica y, con mucha categoría, definió ante la salida del arquero.\nA partir del gol, la Tri manejó los hilos del partido y jugó con la desesperación del rival, que bajó la intensidad a su juego y se estiró demasiado en la cancha.\nEcuador se aprovechó de eso y amplió la diferencia con un tanto de Cristopher Zambrano, tras otra gran asistencia de Vite. Unos minutos después, Medina liquidó las acciones con un golazo.\nDe esta forma, la Selección alcanzó una victoria importantísima en el Grupo A. En la próxima jornada\nenfrentará a Venezuela, el martes 23 de enero, a las 18:00.\nEl Preolímpico se transmite en vivo a través de DSports y Ecuador TV.\nContenido Patrocinado\nLa excelencia arquitectónica y la sostenibilidad se fusionan\nContenido Patrocinado\nObtén en línea el permiso de funcionamiento de tu negocio\nContenido Patrocinado\nDP World Posorja, referente para Ecuador y el mundo\nContenido Patrocinado\nUNACEM Ecuador a la vanguardia en nuevos sistemas constructivos\nContenido Patrocinado\nDisfruta un Carnaval playero en la Costa ecuatoriana\nContenido Patrocinado\nLíderes con propósito: El enfoque de las escuelas de negocios\nContenido Patrocinado\nCultura empresarial contra la violencia de género\nContenido Patrocinado\nDelicias compartidas: La magia de reunirse alrededor de una pizza\nContenido Patrocinado\nCuida tus ojos con estos consejos prácticos\nContenido Patrocinado\nOMODA duplica su presencia global de SUVs",

    "text": "DENVER — The countdown is almost complete. In less than 24 hours the Montana Grizzlies will take the court against the Wisconsin Badgers.\nWednesday was media day at Ball Arena, as Montana will again be thrust into the spotlight as the underdog in a first-round East Region NCAA tournament game.\nRelated: Montana press conference with Travis DeCuire, Brandon Whitney, Joe Pridgen and Kai Johnson\n\"This is what I dreamt of when I was younger. To be in this position,\" Montana guard Brandon Whitney said. \"And I tried to do it for four years before this and finally got it this year. I think it's settled in.\"\nThe road back to the Big Dance for the Grizzlies in the 2024-25 season has been all over the place, as a team with plenty of unknowns beginning the season to becoming a Big Sky juggernaut come tournament time in Boise, Idaho.\n\"I think the most important thing for us is to remember how we got here,\" UM coach Travis DeCuire said. \"We grew as a team, our aggression, our cohesiveness have made us a good team. The lights are going to be bright today. Tomorrow they won't. They'll be normal. And we just need to be ourselves.\"\nRelated: Wisconsin press conference with Greg Gard, Steven Crowl, Max Klesmit and John Tonje\nThe mood was high and focus was clear for the Griz on Wednesday, as the bright lights became official in Denver.\n\"We're still playing and we want to win,\" said Montana's Kai Johnson. \"So I think it's easy for us and I think that's why we're so good is we enjoy each other off the court and have a good time and like to hang out with each other. But then when it's go time it's go time, and everyone kind of knows that.\"\nDeCuire knows his team has the ability to block everything out and lock in on the task at hand.\n\"They're not afraid,\" DeCuire said. \"If you're concerned about your opponent, how big they are, how fast they are and how good they are individually, you might not bring your best game to the table. We've never been concerned with our opponent. We've played good opponents.\"\nIt's not the first time DeCuire has seen this platform. Even he had a takeaway from the last time the Griz were here in 2018 and 2019.\n\"The only thing I would carry over from back then is let it RIP,\" he said. \"There won't be any second thoughts during this game tomorrow.\"\nThe eyes of the country will be on Montana as the Griz are the third game to tip off Thursday and the first in Denver with an 11:30 a.m. start.\nDeCuire has one thing he wants people to know about his program and to take away when they take center court.\n\"The University of Montana has been a staple in college basketball for 50 years,\" DeCuire said. \"And nobody talks about it. And so for us, every time we get on the stage, it's an opportunity to earn that respect and demand that respect. And so we just need to go out and play good basketball and create that conversation.\"",

    "text": "14/03/2024 - 15:47\nO Ambulatório de Sexualidade do Hospital do Câncer II (HC II), do Instituto Nacional de Câncer (Inca), promoveu nesta quinta-feira (14), no Rio de Janeiro, a Oficina Resgate da Autoestima, em razão do Dia Internacional da Mulher. A meta foi criar um ambiente de cuidado e valorização pessoal no qual as mulheres em tratamento possam desfrutar de atividades para elevar a autoestima.\nSegundo o Inca, para muitas mulheres em tratamento, enfrentar a doença [câncer] pode afetar não apenas o corpo, mas também a autoconfiança e a sensação de feminilidade.\nNotícias relacionadas:\nCampanha Março Azul prioriza a prevenção do câncer de intestino. SUS pode gastar R$ 7,84 bi em 2040 com tratamento de câncer, diz Inca.\nA diretora do HC II, Priscila Marietto, destaca a importância de auxiliar pacientes nesse resgate. “A jornada do tratamento pode impactar negativamente a imagem corporal, a confiança e a identidade. Fortalecer a autoestima, promover o bem-estar emocional, melhorar a qualidade de vida e contribuir para a resiliência no tratamento podem proporcionar uma perspectiva mais positiva e encorajadora frente à doença”, afirma.\nMarço Lilás\nA coordenadora do Laboratório de Sexualidade do HC II, Carmen Lúcia de Paula, lembra que a oficina comemorou também na mesma data o Março Lilás, mês de mobilização social e prevenção do câncer de colo do útero.\n“Para chamar a atenção da sociedade de forma geral sobre as medidas de prevenção desse tipo de câncer, que é evitável e tem até 100% de cura, se for diagnosticado nas fases iniciais. Nós destacamos a importância da vacina contra o HPV (sigla em inglês para Papilomavírus Humano) para meninas e meninos de nove a 14 anos, a recomendação do Ministério da Saúde quando ao exame de Papanicolau para mulheres de 25 a 64 anos e o uso de preservativos nas relações sexuais”, diz. Essas são as medidas de prevenção para o câncer de colo de útero. “É chamar a atenção para a importância de promover a saúde da mulher”, frisa.\nPara isso, Carmen Lúcia sustenta que o Inca estava promovendo a Oficina de Resgate de Autoestima, em edição especial, com profissionais que estavam ali para ajudar nos cuidados com as mulheres, melhorar a autoestima e promover um dia diferente com presentes e leveza sobre como manter o bem-estar e a qualidade de vida, a partir do diagnóstico e dos efeitos adversos causados pelos tratamentos.\nLado emocional\nDurante as consultas na enfermagem, nas diferentes fases do tratamento, a coordenadora diz que as profissionais observaram como o lado emocional e a autoestima dessas mulheres ficam desestruturados. Por isso, além dos protocolos de tratamento, as enfermeiras identificaram a necessidade de haver um espaço de acolhimento e de comunicação, onde as pacientes possam, principalmente, verbalizar suas queixas em relação à intimidade.\n“Porque elas não encontram de uma forma fácil espaço para abordar a sua intimidade e falar sobre as suas queixas sexuais. Nós, profissionais, sabemos que os tratamentos causam diminuição da libido, menopausa precoce e um impacto grande na saúde e na qualidade de vida nessas mulheres. Então, como nós temos a proposta de cuidar do integral e abordar a sexualidade, promover a saúde dessas mulheres como um todo faz parte do cuidado do nosso Laboratório de Sexualidade de Ginecologia do Hospital do Câncer”, explica Carmen Lúcia.\nA equipe de voluntários – composta por maquiadores, cabeleireiras e floristas – é liderada pela estilista de vestidos de noiva Ana Carolina Caetano. Além das atividades de beleza, o evento contou com palestra sobre autoestima e promoção da saúde, seguida por apresentação musical, ambas realizadas pelos próprios funcionários do hospital.\nAbismo\nKênia dos Santos Bastos, 45 anos, dona de casa, é ex-paciente do HC II. Ela foi diagnosticada com câncer de colo do útero em 2016 e teve alta em 2021. Kênia era atleta, nadava, corria, pedalava, tinha uma vida normal e teve que parar com todas as atividades. “Quanto recebi o diagnóstico, mudou tudo. Meu mundo caiu. Eu não apresentava sintoma nenhum. Foi devastador. A sensação que eu tive é como se estivesse caindo em um abismo. A última coisa que eu esperava era uma notícia dessa”, recorda.\nToda a família ficou arrasada. Kênia acentua que recebeu todo o amor dos parentes e do marido. “Ele mostrou realmente que me amava. Eu posso dizer que só quem tem câncer sabe o que é. Toda a dor que eu senti ele sentiu por mim, mas nós superanos. Continuamos casados como se fosse o primeiro ano. Foram oito anos, porque foram cinco anos de tratamento e três de alta”, lembra.\nKênia recebeu grande apoio para enfrentar a doença também da parte do Instituto Nacional de Câncer e continua participando das atividades propostas pelo órgão, vinculado ao Ministério da Saúde.\nEla salienta que a dor costuma unir as pessoas. “E junto com a dor, também vêm os momentos bons de amizade e de troca de experiências. Somos uma grande família, uma apoiando a outra, na dor e na alegria”, sintetiza. Sobre o tratamento que recebeu, garante que “se eu não estivesse no Inca, não teria sobrevivido. Fui muito bem assistida em tudo. Eles me ampararam, me acolheram, me deram o melhor medicamento. Só tenho a agradecer”, finaliza.",

    "title": "Will Remote Work Continue To Work as We Head Toward 2024? A Look at the Post-Pandemic Years",
    "text": "Globally, workers have fallen in love with remote work, but according to reports, about 64% of executives believe it’s time to return to the office. It’s hard to be sure of what the future of work will look like. But there’s one thing we can do, and that’s to look at trends.\nLet’s take a closer look at some trending contrasting opinions and realities of remote work as we head into 2024.\nCEOs Say Remote Work Will End Soon\nAccording to experts, global executives believe that the time of remote work is almost up. As stated in the\nKPMG Global CEO Outlook, 64% of global executives believe 2026 will be the year the world will return to full in-office work. CEOs further say they are exploring incentives and perks to make on-site work more attractive than remote work.\nThis greatly clashes with what employees want. Unsurprisingly, workers who have been fully remote over the past three years don’t want to return to the office. Less commuting, no more strict\nwork outfits, personalized workspaces, flexible work hours, and enhanced work-life balance are just a few obvious benefits of working remotely.\nIn\na study by Gallup, 90% of workers say they don’t want to return to entirely on-site work. In fact, many employees are willing to let go of their jobs that don’t offer them the flexibility they want.\nSince the great resignation began in early 2021, employers have been worried about losing their biggest talents because of flexibility issues. However, with industries finding their balance and new talents aggressively developing, power seems to be shifting back to employers. It’s interesting to see how the next few years will play out.\nOne of the most vocal CEOs about his dislike for remote work is Elon Musk. Not only did the Tesla CEO send a notorious email to workers last year necessitating a minimum of 40 hours per week, but the recent 2023\nQ3 Tesla Earnings Call featured Musk labeling remote workers as “detached from reality.”\nMusk has a long history of disdain for remote work, but in recent times, several other CEOs have queued behind his narrative of ending remote work. In August 2023, in an ironic move, Zoom reversed its fully remote work culture to mandate employees within 50 miles of the company back to the office.\nIt doesn’t end there. Meta (formerly Facebook) also recently initiated a 3-day office workday policy. These hybrid setups have proven to be a feasible compromise between employers wanting to maximize work hours and employees who love the taste of remote work.\nAre All Companies Against Remote Work?\nThe short answer is ‘No.” There are global companies that remain supportive and invested in remote work. For instance, Gumroad has a fully remote work culture, with “no meetings” being one the company is known for.\nDrew Houston, the CEO of Dropbox, gives a contrasting view of the future of remote work. According to the CEO, “If you trust people and treat them like adults, they will behave like adults.” With his company’s 90/10 rule — 90% of the year for remote work and 10% for off-site events — Houston demonstrates trust in people staying productive irrespective of location.\nAnd he’s not the only one. More global companies are encouraging employees to work on schedules and systems that are flexible and convenient for them.\nWho Are Big Remote Work Advocates?\nRemote work and hybrid arrangements are excellent for companies that are all about employees getting their jobs done and not when such employees log on. Expectedly, different companies have slightly varying ways of handling this need for flexibility.\nAdobe\nOne of the established computer software companies that continue to support the remote work parade is Adobe. In the words of Gloria Chen, Adobe’s Chief People Officer, “While we believe in the value of in-person interaction, we know that in some cases, a remote work arrangement makes sense for Adobe…”\nThe company created a smart digital campus app called Adobe Life to make\nremote work more inclusive for employees. Thanks to the app, workers can keep up to date with company developments while also encouraging interpersonal relationships and communication.\nAirbnb\nFor a company that helps users find short lets around the world, it isn’t unprecedented to have its employees living and working from anywhere in the world. The company affirmed its work-from-anywhere policy in 2022 and hasn’t looked back since.\nAtlassian\nIn a\nblog post, Atlassian confirmed that about 300 of its 8000+ employees have moved to a new country since its fully remote work policy came into play. In the same vein, the company claims that more than 10% of its US-based workers relocated to a new state after the company established this policy. So far, Atlassian’s \"Team Anywhere\" initiative has enjoyed marked success, and the company continues to ship products that improve remote work efficiency for the world.\nHubSpot\nHaving a client list of 170,000 businesses relying on software created by the company hasn’t prevented it from sticking to its remote work resolve. The company has three work arrangements: working entirely remotely, going to the office twice a week, and going to the office three times a week.\nWhat Does the Future Hold for Remote Work?\nThere is more than one opinion on the future of work. With the remote work concept experiencing different realities in varying industries and diverse results, it posits not to be a one-size-fits-all model.\nHowever, trends like the rapid adoption of new tech tools, focus on employee well-being, hybrid work models, ease of remote onboarding and integration, emphasis on cybersecurity, and more are bolstering the development of a new culture. Even if remote work is not an option, companies can transfer its principles and benefits to the office environment. Business executives should embrace and adopt this work setup, which is vital to unlocking sustained productivity.",
