    "title": "Writ Raises $3.8M Seed Round Led By Gradient Ventures to Help Companies Better Use Data for Key Decisions",
    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO Writ , a startup rethinking how companies use data to make decisions, announced $3.8M in Series Seed funding today. The round was led by Gradient Ventures, with participation from Defy.vc, High Alpha, Toba Capital, and numerous angels.\nWrit Co-Founders Adam Weinstein (CEO) and Jason McGhee (CTO) previously started Cursor, a data catalog solution, which was acquired by DataRobot in 2019. Following the acquisition, McGhee spent his time at DataRobot building out the company's Deep Learning offerings while Weinstein served as Vice President of Product Management. Prior to Cursor, the duo held data and engineering roles at LinkedIn, Pandora, ExactTarget (now Salesforce), and Deloitte.\n\"For decades, data teams and the functions they support have shared a common mission without the tools to realize it. We're redefining how people work with data by using AI to eliminate manual work, uncertainty, and barriers to collaboration,\" said Weinstein.\nWrit is focused on building out the product's core functionality alongside a set of industry-leading design partners and thought leaders. The company is currently providing access to key partners and intends to open a beta program later this year.\n\"Data teams need to accelerate their communication and decision making to stay competitive. Classic dashboard and reporting tools simply don't offer what professionals need. We're rebuilding the experience from the ground up alongside domain experts, integrating bleeding edge ideas in design, collaboration, and AI,\" says McGhee.\n\"Companies are looking for solutions to explain and understand their underlying data because most customer data is messy, disorganized, and inaccurate. The team at Writ is building a much-needed solution to allow teams to ingest this disparate data and make sense of it in real-time,\" said Darian Shirazi , General Partner at Gradient. \"We're excited to partner with Adam, Jason, and the Writ team as they build a next generation intelligence platform for the AI era.\"\nDespite the cost of data storage continuing to plummet, teams struggle to get access to the answers they need to fuel growth. Writ solves this by making the process of sharing and discussing data a team sport. Whether helping a Board of Directors prepare for an earnings call or a Retail Store Manager manage inventory, Writ moves the discussion forward across an organization.\n\"When making decisions, many companies struggle to harness data's full potential. Writ's innovative approach transforms data into actionable insights, empowering teams to collaborate effectively and drive meaningful outcomes,\" said Bob Rosin , General Partner at defy.vc.\nTo get in touch with the Writ team, reach out at [email protected] .\nAbout Writ Writ helps its partners make informed decisions.

Daily exposures are increasing, especially for children. The American Academy of Pediatrics has [highlighted how ](https://ehtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/American-Academy-of-Pediatrics-letter-to-the-FCC-July-12-2012.pdf)children absorb proportionately higher RF radiation into their brain and bodies during sensitive stages of development.

Об этом сообщает издание Polygon.\nГод назад тот же игрок уничтожил свою первую золотую сковороду во время матча, и тогда этот момент попал на видео. Позже стало известно, что причиной стал алкогольный вечер, после которого Gregarious обратился в поддержку Steam с просьбой восстановить предмет. В тот раз сковороду вернули.\nНа этот раз мотив и причина неизвестны. Сообщество предполагает, что вернуть сковороду в этот раз будет практически невозможно.",

Ancelotti said he expected his team to play better together and blamed himself, insisting it his responsibility to make matters click. \"It is clear that we are struggling to find the soundness of last season,\" he said. \"But we must not look for excuses. The schedule is tight and we have to recover quickly, because on Sunday we have another game. \"I need to have a clearer strategy, to give the players more clarity in what I want. It's costing us more than we thought. We have to work and concentrate on the path we want to take.\" Kylian Mbappe endured another frustrating performance by his high standards, with the France star yet to score in LaLiga. Mbappe had a whopping nine shots, yet only hit the target with two of then. He has had 17 shots in total in LaLiga this term, making the 25-year-old the player to have had the most attempts in the top five European leagues, and the one with the worst expected goals (xG) underperformance (1.8 xG, no goals scored). Ancelotti, however, says the whole team, not just individuals, must improve. He added: \"Our game has been slow. There is not much mobility and the strikers are receiving the ball with the opposing teams already close. \"When we don't have the ball, we leave too many spaces between the lines.\" \"I don't think it's a mental problem, because the team trains well. It's just that sometimes you don't find the best way to play.... Things are not going well and we have to fix it soon.\"",

    "text": "A severe weather warning has been issued across the South West over New Year's weekend. Huge wind gusts are expected to cause disruption across the region, affecting transport services and potentially causing further power cuts.\nThe yellow wind warning is in place from 11am tomorrow (December 30) until 3am on December 31 and includes the whole of the South West, parts of western Wales, and the South coastline. The Met Office says: \"A spell of strong and gusty winds will move east across England and Wales, bringing some disruption to travel and services.\"\nThe forecaster adds: \"An active cold front will move east across England and Wales during Saturday and into Sunday and will be characterised by strong winds and some heavy rain. Gusts of 45-50 mph widely, but squally near the cold front with some gusts around 60 mph, whilst the strongest gusts are likely near coasts in the west and south, with 65-75 mph in places.\"\nBristol city centre set for radical change with seven major plans Moment police try to pull over white van blocking outside m-way lane - and he ignores them\nIt comes after Storm Gerrit brought major disruption across the country, forcing road bridges to close, sparking localised power cuts in Bristol, and bringing down scaffolding in the city. The storm whirled through the UK, causing a reported 'tornado' in Greater Manchester, where it damaged around 100 properties.\nThe warning is in place until the early hours of Sunday (December 31) and the Met Office has said the forecast on New Year's Day is expected to be calmer, with breezy but weaker winds predicted. Steven Ramsdale is a Met Office Chief Forecaster. He said: “This system is likely to bring a range of\nweather including hill snow. Heavy rain will spread across all but the far north on Saturday affecting similar areas previously affected by Storm Gerrit. However, this rainfall will be a step down from that seen during Storm Gerrit.”\nRead about the full New Year's Day forecast in Bristol\nhere.\nWhat to Expect\n- Some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport are likely\n- It’s likely that some coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities will be affected by spray and/or large waves\n- Probably some bus and train services affected, with some journeys taking longer\n- Some short term loss of power and other services is possible\n- Delays for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges likely",

    "text": "A four-year-old California boy who wandered away from a campground in the Sierra National Forest was found safe after spending 22 hours alone in the wilderness, authorities said. A search-and-rescue team of about 50 officers and volunteers set out around 11am on Thursday after the child was reported missing from the camping site surrounded by dense forest north of Fresno. The boy, from Torrance near Los Angeles, was last seen wearing shorts and a T-shirt, the Fresno County Sheriff’s Office said. Around 8am on Friday, the boy was discovered in good condition “nestled under a tree” near a lake about a quarter mile (0.4 km) from the Rancheria Campground where his family was. “He was hungry and exhausted, but otherwise in good health. We got him a sandwich and then carried him out to be reunited with Mom and Dad,” the sheriff’s office said on Saturday. Officials say the boy simply wandered away and lost his sense of direction. The sheriff’s office thanked members of the public who volunteered to join the search, “kept their eyes peeled, spread the word on social media and sent prayers up”. “All of this undoubtedly helped to bring (him) home safely,” the department said.",

Il fenomeno, alimentato da una serie di espulsioni di massa coronale (CME) dal Sole, potrebbe portare l’aurora boreale a danzare anche nei cieli d’Europa.\nLa Grande Macchia Solare AR3664, paragonata alle famigerate macchie solari di tipo Carrington, ha recentemente scagliato 5 potenti CME in direzione della Terra.
