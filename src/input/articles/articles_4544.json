    "text": "The Canadian government launched an online visa waiver service for eligible countries in 2015. Citizens of the Czech Republic are among those who do not need a visa to enter Canada for travel, business, or transit. Czech nationals can use the Canadian eTA as an official online travel authorization when visiting Canada. Czech citizens, on the other hand, must apply for a Canada eTA visa if they intend to visit Canada for travel, business, transit, or medical reasons. This visa allows Czech nationals to stay for a maximum of 6 months per visit and is valid for 5 years. When an eTA is accepted, it is digitally linked to the traveler's passport. Those who wish to visit Canada for other purposes, such as study or employment, should get in touch with the Canadian embassy or consulate in their area for more details. Czech travelers who meet all Canadian eTA requirements can start completing the eTA application form online. The form is a simple online questionnaire that takes 20 minutes to complete. Requirements of Canada Visa for Czech Citizens - A valid travel document or passport in order to apply for Canada eTA. - A valid credit or debit card or PayPal account to pay for the Canada eTA. - A valid email address, to receive the Canada eTA in their inbox. Those who already run a successful business in their home country can use the Canadian Business Visa to expand operations or start a new business in Canada. Canada has a plethora of business opportunities. Because of its collection of some of the world's most prestigious cities, developed financial and healthcare systems, and expanding industry, Canada offers excellent business opportunities. Canada is widely regarded as one of the best places in the world to establish a business. Expert entrepreneurs from all over the world are migrating to Canada because of the country's combination of European advantages and a higher standard of living. After having a successful business career in their home country, individuals can expand their current businesses or start new ones in Canada with the help of a special category of visa known as the Canada Business Visa. Your initial length of stay will be determined when you apply for a business visa. The Canada business visa is valid for up to three years and can be extended for an additional two years as long as your business remains active. This period can be extended up to six years. Canada offers a great opportunity for entrepreneurs' businesses. To be eligible for this visa, the applicant must be employed by a Canadian company or work in Canada. DOCUMENTS REQUIRED - A valid Passport & travel history - Background documentation - Documents from your company - A formal invitation from a respected company in the country where you do business is required. - You must have enough money to support yourself and your dependents during your stay. - Documents proving you will not be staying beyond the stipulated time. - Completed application & consulate fees. - Adequate medical insurance CANADA ETA FOR LITHUANIAN CITIZENS The Canadian government implemented this online permission in 2015 to promote foreign travel and visits. Residents of Lithuania and the other 58 countries and territories can visit Canada for a short period of time without a visa. A visa is not required for Canadians to enter Lithuania. Citizens of Lithuania must obtain a Canadian Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) in order to enter the country. However, if you are a Lithuanian traveling by air, you must apply for a Canadian ETA. You can travel to Canada using this program without obtaining a traditional visa or visiting the Canadian Embassy. Lithuanians must enter Canada with a valid eTA. It allows foreign citizens of select countries to enter Canada for tourism, business, or short-term transit purposes. It is a multiple entry permit, each granting a maximum stay of 180 days. The eTA for Canada is electronically linked to the Lithuanian passport and is valid for 5 years, except for passports that expire earlier. In this case, the Canadian eTA expires at the same time as the passport. Once Lithuanian citizens have confirmed that they meet the eTA requirements, they can proceed to completing the Canadian eTA application form. This is a simple questionnaire that will take you a few minutes to complete. WHAT DOCUMENTS DO I NEED FOR A CANADIAN ETA? - Valid passport – to apply for a Canada ETA, your travel document needs to maintain valid for six more months from your arrival date in Canada. - E-mail – provide a correct email address because we will send your ETA by that email. Besides, we recommend that you print your ETA. - Payments – to pay your request, you can use a credit/debit card or PayPal account. CANADA ETA FOR LATVIAN CITIZENS Latvian citizens wishing to visit Canada must first obtain a Canadian Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA). The Canadian government introduced the eTA in 2015 to alleviate the complications associated with traditional visas. Canada's visa policy allows citizens of a variety of countries, including Latvia, to cross the border without a visa. The Canadian eTA is mandatory for all Latvian citizens who visit Canada for a short period of time. The Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) is a computerized system that allows certain travelers to legally enter Canada. It is only available to residents of certain countries whose citizens (including Latvians) are allowed to enter Canada for short-term tourism, business, or transit purposes. The Canadian eTA is an online multiple entry visa waiver. It is valid for 5 years and allows Latvian visitors to stay in the country for 6 months on each visit. The electronic travel authorization is linked to the traveler's passport and is not transferable to a new document. This means that if a passport expires before the allowed 5 years of the Canadian eTA, then this travel permit expires as well. Latvians who meet the requirements can proceed to the eTA application form for Canada. This form is a simple questionnaire that takes approximately 15 to 20 minutes to complete. WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS? - Valid Passport: You cannot apply for an ETA from Canada if you do not have a valid passport. This document must be valid for at least 6 months from the date of flight. - Email address: You must provide a valid email address as the ETA confirmation will be emailed in PDF format. The ETA is electronically linked to your passport, but you still need to keep a physical copy. - Payment Methods: You can use a credit or debit cards, but you can also use PayPal to pay for the eTA fees. CANADA ETA FOR BULGARIAN CITIZENS If Bulgarian citizens intend to visit Canada for a short period of time, they must obtain a Canadian eTA visa. The Canadian government launched this online visa waiver service for qualifying countries in 2015. It should be noted that any other mode of transportation will necessitate a separate travel authorization. Bulgarian citizens, on the other hand, do not require a visa for leisure, business, or transit purposes. The Canadian eTA applies only to international flights landing in Canada. Bulgarian citizens can enter Canada multiple times for stays of up to six months each by obtaining a Canadian Electronic Travel Authorization. The eTA is valid for five years and is available online. The eTA is electronically linked to Bulgarian visitors' passports and cannot be transferred to a new travel document. This means that if a passport with an approved eTA expires within 5 years, your travel authorization will expire as well. Bulgarians who confirm that they meet the requirements can start the Canadian eTA application process online. The application form is a simple questionnaire that takes less than 30 minutes to complete. CANADA VISA WAIVER REQUIREMENTS FOR BULGARIA - Valid Passport: Your travel document must be valid for six months from your arrival on Canadian territory. - Email address: Please make sure you have access to the email address you provided, as all the information we have about your ETA will be communicated to you through this email. - Payment Methods: You can use a credit or debit cards, but you can also use PayPal account to pay for the eTA fees.

    "text": "Scientists Develop Non-Invasive, Pain-Free Method to Reprogram Canine Stem Cells New method generates canine-induced pluripotent stem cells in dogs from urine samples without using feeder cells Scientists at Osaka Metropolitan University have devised an efficient, non-invasive, and pain-free method to reprogram canine stem cells from urine samples, bringing furry companions one step closer to veterinary regenerative treatment. Their [work has been published](https://www.cell.com/stem-cell-reports/fulltext/S2213-6711(23)00458-7?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2213671123004587%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) in Stem Cell Reports. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been widely employed in studies on human generative medicine. With the growing importance of advanced medical care for dogs and cats, there is an expectation that new therapies utilizing iPSCs will be developed for these companion animals, just as they have been for humans. Unfortunately, canine somatic cells exhibit lower reprogramming efficiency compared to those of humans, limiting the types of canine cells available for generating iPSCs. IPSC induction often involves using feeder cells from a different species. However, considering the associated risks, minimizing xenogeneic components is often advisable, signifying the need to improve the efficiency of reprogramming various types of canine cells in dogs without using feeder cells. A research team led by Shingo Hatoya, PhD and Masaya Tsukamoto, PhD, from the Graduate School of Veterinary Science at Osaka Metropolitan University has identified six reprogramming genes that can boost canine iPSC generation by about 120 times compared to conventional methods using fibroblasts. The iPSCs were created from urine-derived cells using a non-invasive, straightforward, and painless method. Additionally, the researchers succeeded in generating canine iPSCs without feeder cells, a feat that had been impossible until now. The team aims to disseminate their findings in the global research community, contributing to advances in regenerative medicine and genetic disease research in veterinary medicine. “As a veterinarian, I have examined and treated many animals,” explained Hatoya. “However, there are still many diseases that either cannot be cured or have not been fully understood. In the future, I am committed to continue my research on differentiating canine iPSCs into various types of cells and applying them to treat sick dogs, hopefully bringing joy to many animals and their owners.” This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP18K19273, JP18H02349, JP19J22851, and JP22H02525.

    "text": "One dumpster diver just uncovered an ugly truth digging through Ulta's trash to find foundations, scrubs, and serums tossed without a second thought. In a recent video shared by Dumpster Diving Mama (@dumpsterdivingmama), the diver rummages through discarded goods behind an Ulta store. After going through a few bags in just a few minutes, she uncovers a haul of cosmetics, skincare, and haircare items, many of them from big-name brands like Tarte and Mally. These were tossed out in bulk and mostly destroyed with foundation spills or sticky residue. \"This is what it's like diving at Ulta most of the time... not glamorous,\" said the caption of the video. Despite the mess, she manages to salvage a handful of products — headbands, towels, even a few untouched foundations. \"I got a decent little bag of stuff that I could salvage,\" she says. But the tone remains bittersweet, underscoring the sheer volume of potentially usable products thrown away, and how much more could've been saved. Dumpster diving is a great way for people to recover edible, usable, or wearable items from retail trash bins. While not everyone is up for rooting through garbage, it actually benefits consumers and the environment. Recovering discarded goods diverts waste from landfills , reduces demand for new production, and gives items a second life . This means the materials that go into the creation, shipping, and packaging of the product are not immediately wasted. Commenters under the post were upset with the wastefulness displayed by Ulta .

But it makes me angry to see how wasteful these companies are,\" another added.

    "title": "Massive California waves injure some onlookers and bring flooding, treacherous beach conditions up the West coast",
    "text": "(CNN) — A powerful offshore storm is driving towering waves into the California coastline, triggering flooding and warnings of dangerous and damaging swells after several people were injured by a wave along Ventura beach on Thursday. The wave crashed over a barrier along the southern California beach, tossing a wall of fast-moving water at a group of onlookers who rushed to escape the deluge, witness video shows. Seawater quickly knocked some people off their feet and pummeled cars as drivers tried to speed away. Nearly 20 people were briefly swept away in the incident and eight people were taken to the hospital, Ventura officials said. High water and dangerous rip currents will churn along some of California’s beaches through the weekend as much of the West coast – spanning from the US-Mexico border to southern Oregon – is under coastal flood and high-surf alerts, the National Weather Service said. Waves as high as telephone poles – about 40 feet – could slam into San Francisco through Friday morning. Fifteen to 20-foot waves are expected along the central coast. The dangerous conditions pose an “exceptional risk” of ocean drowning and damage to structures like piers and jetties, the National Weather Service said. The spectacular waters have enthralled some surfers and onlookers, but weather officials are cautioning that the waves and strong rip tides can be perilous for those nearby. “Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore,” the National Weather Service warned. At least one fisherman fell overboard in a harbor off Oxnard and later came ashore uninjured, the Ventura County Fire Department said. The conditions have already caused some road closures and evacuations in coastal California communities and prompted the rescue of five campers along the San Luis Obispo coast. Crews in Ventura worked through the night to reinforce a mile-long sand barrier that was damaged by powerful waters on Thursday, the local fire department said. Standing about seven feet tall, the raised wall helps protect beachside communities. Hoping to discourage spectators, local officials closed a main access point to Ventura Pier, which saw a swell of about 20 feet on Thursday. Some coastal streets in the area have also been closed as a precaution. In central California’s Santa Cruz, the sheriff’s office issued an evacuation warning for some areas on Thursday, which included areas of Rio Del Mar, where seawater filled beachside roadways and pushed against some homes, CNN affiliate KION reported. The warnings were lifted later in the day. The most extreme impacts were expected along the central and Ventura County coasts, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches, the weather service in Los Angeles said Thursday. Tempestuous waters are also battering Northern California, where the Bay Area could see waves of 28 to 33 feet, the weather service advised. A high wind alert is also in effect for the Bay Area on Friday as wind gusts of up to 50 mph are expected. Rainfall is likely to stretch northward from the Bay Area throughout the day Friday before shifting south into the weekend. Despite safety warnings, the massive waves are a welcome sight to surfers hungry to tackle the legendary swells at Mavericks Beach, about 25 miles south of San Francisco. Pro surfers and spectators flocked to the beach on Thursday for a competition at the site known for having some of the biggest waves in the world, CNN affiliate KGO reported. Local resident Ion Banner told the affiliate that surfers from Brazil, Tahiti and Hawaii were out in the water. “It’s pretty gnarly, it’s super big,” he said. “The waves looked absolutely massive and it was everything that we expected,” said Miguel Blanco, who told KGO he flew in from Portugal to surf the waves. “It was really big, I’d say 40-60 foot waves.” Mavericks’ jaw-dropping waves – caused by unique underwater rock formations – reach their biggest heights in the winter, when big wave surfers from all over the world make pilgrimages to face the swells. The legendary waves and the surfers who brave them have been the subject of several films and documentaries, including the 2012 biopic “Chasing Mavericks” about American surfer Jay Moriarity’s journey to surf Mavericks as a teen. On Thursday, the conditions were prime for surfers like Blanco. “If it’s your turn, you just gotta go,” Blanco said. “When you see a big wave, you’re kinda scared but at the same time you’re feeling like you should go and you just go and enjoy the ride.” CNN’s David Williams contributed to this report.

    "text": "VENICE, Italy — Angelina Jolie confessed she was afraid of not being able to \"live up\" to Maria Callas' legend in her new biopic about the great diva's extraordinary yet tragic life that premiered Thursday at the Venice Film Festival.\nIn \"Maria,\" the American movie star tackles the tormented final years of the 20th century's most celebrated opera singer who mesmerized audiences around the world.\n\"The bar in this... are the Maria Callas fans and those who love opera,\" Jolie told a press conference ahead of the premiere of the movie by Chilean director Pablo Larrain. \"And my fear would be to disappoint them.\"\n\"I really came to care for her so I felt I didn't want to do a disservice to this woman,\" she added.\nJolie said she hoped to honor the \"legacy\" of the diva, who died nearly alone in 1977 aged 53, after a whirlwind life and career that was nevertheless marked by great sadness.\nThe much-anticipated highlight of the festival's second day was the last in Larrain's trilogy of movies about iconic women — after 2021's \"Spencer\" about Princess Diana and 2016's \"Jackie\" on Jacqueline Kennedy.\nThe director has said only a larger-than-life star in her own right could play the role of the American-born Greek singer, whose successes at La Scala, La Fenice, Covent Garden, and New York are the stuff of opera legend 100 years after her birth, \"This movie would not have existed without Angelina.\"\nAbsent from the screen since 2021, the 49-year-old American actress and director has kept a relatively low profile even as her lengthy, acrimonious divorce from Brad Pitt continues to make headlines.\nRelated: Shiloh Jolie, daughter of Angelina and Brad, officially drops Pitt name\nThe public's fascination with Jolie's private life has parallels with Callas, whose stormy life and loves — including her relationship with the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, who left her for Jacqueline Kennedy — were similarly fodder for the tabloids.\nBut while the paparazzi were out in full force Thursday for Jolie on the red carpet — in a camel gown with matching faux-fur shrug — the actress will not cross paths with Pitt during her visit.\nPitt's action comedy \"Wolfs\", in which he and George Clooney play rival professional fixers, is playing out of competition on the Lido on Sunday, as purposely planned by festival organizers to avoid awkward encounters.\nLiving up to Callas\nOne of 21 films in competition for Venice's prestigious Golden Lion prize, \"Maria\" opens with a whirlwind edit of the highlights of Callas' life as seen through the eyes of the paparazzi, with Jolie singing \"Casta Diva\" in Paris in her red silk wrap, accepting ovations at La Scala or frolicking with Aristotle Onassis on his yacht.\nIn reality, the frail artist is popping sedatives and remembering those heady days of her life — most of them onstage — through drug-induced flashbacks, in the tour-de-force performance by Jolie.\n\"Music is born of distress,\" says Callas, as she vainly struggles to find her faltering voice yet again, sheltering at home in the company of her trusted butler and housemaid (played by Pierfrancesco Favino and Alba Rohrwacher) and occasionally breaking the monotony to sit alone in cafes to \"be adored.\"\nJolie said she studied for nearly seven months ahead of filming, training herself to mimic the great artist's cadences and tones as the film mixes in her own singing voice with that of the celebrated soprano.\nRelated: Ghouls, Gotham and Gaga as Venice film festival opens\n\"I was terribly nervous,\" Jolie said. \"I was frightened to live up to her.\"\nJolie said she related to Callas's gentler side, \"the part of her that's extremely soft and doesn't have room in the world to be as soft as she truly was, and as emotionally open as she truly was.\"\n\"I share her vulnerability more than anything.\"\nLoneliness and pain\nWhile some critics found flaws with Callas' voice, it was nevertheless deeply expressive, able to impart dramatic intensity to any role, which combined with her beauty and presence often brought frenzied standing ovations.\nA towering talent with a tireless work ethic, Callas was often portrayed as a \"temperamental\" star, a label she rejected, defending herself as a disciplined perfectionist with high standards.\nShe single-handedly revived the 19th-century bel canto operas of Donizetti, Rossini, and Bellini — whose \"Norma\" was one of Callas' signature roles.\nBut the diva's voice began to fail and even as she struggled to rekindle it, the \"critics were so cruel,\" said Jolie.\n\"I don't know if she passed knowing that she did her best and she was appreciated and loved. I think she may have died with a lot of loneliness and pain.\"\nRELATED: Jenna Ortega honors original 'Beetlejuice' on Venice Film Festival red carpet\nDaniel Radcliffe, Angelina Jolie win their first Tony Awards Lav Diaz, Janine Gutierrez film screening at Venice Film Festival",

    "text": "Striking teachers with the FAE union march through the streets to press their contract demands Tuesday, Dec. 12, 2023 in Montreal.\nQuebec could be seeing the beginning of the end of a long-lasting labour conflict between the province and hundreds of thousands of public sector workers.\nAfter weeks of striking, the provincial government and a major teachers’ union had a breakthrough at the bargaining table.\nThe Federation autonome de l’enseignement (FAE), which represents some 66,000 teachers, has reached a tentative deal with the province over collective agreements late Wednesday.\nThey’ve reached a consensus regarding working conditions and salaries, according to the offices of Treasury Board Chair Sonia LeBel and Education Minister Bernard Drainville.\n“Yes, there is relief,” said Sylvain Martel, head of the Regroupement des comités de parents autonomes du Québec, which represents parents of about 200,000 francophone and anglophone students. “I heard from parents in the week before Christmas and there was a lot of despair.”\nThe details of the proposed agreement are not being shared, though.\nVideo: School administrators want Quebec to consider back-to-work legislation amid ongoing teacher’s strike\nThe union says it first has to bring it to its council. If the council approves it, then it becomes an agreement in principle that will have to be submitted to all union members for a vote.\n“We will leave it to our council to determine if this is an agreement in principle that responds to the pressing needs of teachers as well as their students,” FAE president Mélanie Hubert said in a news release.\n“The 66,500 members of the FAE have just spent 22 days in the streets, without pay, to be heard. We will respect our democratic process before saying more.”\nFor Marc Ranger, a former union leader, this development means the worst is over.\n“I’m very confident that we will be able to put that unlimited general strike behind us,” Ranger said.\nThe proposed deal comes after an unlimited strike since Nov. 23 and a four-day negotiation blitz. The FAE represents nearly 40 per cent of teachers in the province.\nThe strike forced the closure of hundreds of schools across Quebec and students were out of class for about four weeks before the holidays.\nThe FAE is negotiating separately from other unions. Last week, the FSE — the province’s largest teachers union that represents some 100,000 teachers — reached its own agreement over working conditions.\nCommon Front inks deal on salaries Striking teachers weren’t the only ones to see some movement in ongoing negotiations Thursday.\nThe Common Front, a labour alliance of four major unions representing about 420,000 public sector workers in the education and health sectors, said in the afternoon there is a proposed deal with the government on salaries.\nMore on Canada\nIt says the tentative deal will be presented over the coming days to its member groups, which will decide whether to take the agreement to workers for a vote.\n“On the salary front, the objectives of the common front were based on two key principles: protecting our 420,000 workers against inflation and securing a certain overall catch-up of wages for all workers. And that’s what guided us throughout this negotiation blitz to reach a tentative agreement proposal,” the Common Front said in a news release.\nQuebec’s treasury board president also confirmed the news on social media, but stopped short of revealing any details.\n“The details of the agreement will remain confidential until union members have decided on its content,” LeBel wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\nThe latest announcement comes one day after the Common Front confirmed all of its unions had come to a tentative agreement over working conditions.\nThe Common Front held 11 strike days over the past two months to put pressure on the government. Before Christmas, leaders maintained their members were ready to undertake an indefinite walkout in the new year.\nNo agreement of any kind with nurses There is still no deal in place for some 80,000 health-care professionals, ranging from nurses to respiratory therapists.\nThe Fédération interprofessionnelle de la santé du Québec (FIQ) confirmed Thursday that talks with the government are in progress.\nThose negotiations have reached an impasse and a conciliator has been appointed.\nRanger says that will be a tough battle.\n— with files from The Canadian Press",
