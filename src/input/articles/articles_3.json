Les [Girondins de Bordeaux](../infos/article-girondins-bordeaux-prend-une-decision-terrible-et-renonce-a-son-statut-de-club-professionnel-452783.html) traversent la période la plus sombre de leur histoire. Fondé en 1920, le FCGB va perdre son statut de club professionnel. Un monument du football français qui est en totale perdition. \"Le Tribunal de Commerce prononcera, très prochainement, l’ouverture d’une procédure collective qui entraînera automatiquement la perte du statut professionnel du Club. Dès lors, au vu des délais très courts avant le début de la saison de National 1, le Club a dû renoncer à demander le maintien de son statut professionnel faute de quoi il aurait dû se présenter à nouveau devant la DNCG avec un budget ne correspondant pas à la réalité à venir du Club, ce qui aurait pu le conduire à des sanctions supplémentaires lourdes.\", peut-on lire dans le communiqué publié par le club. Par conséquence, le centre de formation va fermer ses portes et les contrats des joueurs vont être rompus.

    "text": "Fair Acres Geriatric Center has done it again.\nFor the second consecutive year, the county-owned and operated facility in Lima has ranked as one of the country’s top nursing homes while getting a five-star federal rating and being found deficiency free.\nAnd, this time, they did it on top of\na federal lawsuit against the county for a death that occurred there during the pandemic. The case was closed last summer after a confidential settlement was reached.\nHaving been serving county residents for 200 years, Fair Acres is the largest skilled nursing unit in Delaware County and provides long-term care for any adult, regardless of age, with a demonstrated need for 24-hour-a-day nursing care. The facility also offers short-term rehabilitation stays and serves as a geriatric training site for local colleges, universities and nursing schools.\nThe Fair Acres Geriatric Center was lauded by Delaware County Council for recently garnering a trifecta of accomplishments, all for the second time in a row.\nFirst, Newsweek named Fair Acres Geriatric Center as one of America’s Best Nursing Homes for 2024.\nOut of 12,273 nursing homes across the United States, Newsweek picked the top 750 for this distinction based on performance data, peer recommendations, the handling of COVID-19, the facility’s accreditations and resident satisfaction.\nSecondly, the Pennsylvania Department of Health did a four-day unannounced visit to assess operations and found no deficiencies at the 435-bed facility.\nAnd, thirdly, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that oversees nursing homes, gave Fair Acres another five-star rating.\nA team effort\n“We’re very happy and I couldn’t do it without my staff,” Fair Acres Administrator Bill D’Amico said of the 850 employees there. “They all play a part in that. You can’t drive the ship if you don’t have people working on the engines.”\nDelaware County Council agreed.\n“Congratulations and thank you for all your work,” Council Chair Dr. Monica Taylor said. “You and the team — there’s a massive team at Fair Acres that makes all of this happen — Thank you for all that you’ve done for our residents and for your work to keep us at this high level of rating in the state and across the country.”\n“I and all of council congratulate our hard-working team at Fair Acres led by its Administrator Bill D’Amico … for this truly well-earned distinction,” Councilwoman Christine Reuther said. “We all know that the last few years have been extraordinarily challenging for those in health care so the physicians, the nurses, the therapists, the custodial staff, maintenance, the dietary staff, the plumbers, the security, the whole team that makes Fair Acres hum … thank you and congratulations.”\nD’Amico said the facility plans a Recognition Day for employees next week as banners have been ordered to display these achievements.\nReuther also addressed the Newsweek ranking.\n“Out of over 12,000 nursing homes analyzed across the country, Newsweek selected the top 6%,” she said. “That’s just 750 nursing homes for recognition … Fair Acres ranked 26th among Pennsylvania’s nursing homes and the only nursing home in Delaware County to receive the honor. That is pretty impressive”\nD’Amico noted that the peer recommendations are made by people outside of the facility and added that Fair Acres does not know who is chosen to give those recommendations.\nHe also spoke to the state Department of Health evaluation, which granted a zero deficiency survey to Fair Acres last month.\n“440 beds are occupied and there’s not a single deficiency in the audit,” Reuther said.\nWhile thanking council members for their continued support, D’Amico explained that that’s a challenging achievement to reach.\n“The average 100-bed nursing home gets an average of seven deficiencies from the state when they come out,” he said. “We received zero deficiencies this survey and zero deficiencies last year.”\nAnd, then, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services sorted through submitted data to bestow Fair Acres with its five-star rating.\n“We have to report whatever happens to a resident: an ulcer, a fall, etc.” D’Amico said. “As long as there’s the right intervention, there’s no deficiencies.\nHe said even delays to doctors’ appointments are part of this evaluation, as is a full kitchen inspection, assessing cleanliness and temperature of food.\nThe lawsuit\nThis second round of accolades comes following a settlement reached last summer on behalf of Christopher Beaty Jr. and Nichole Garcia, who alleged Delaware County failed to design or enact policies to limit the spread of COVID-19 in Fair Acres, leading to the death of 63-year-old Christopher Beaty Sr. after he was exposed to the virus through his roommate.\nLast summer, U.S. District Court Judge Paul S. Diamond issued an order dismissing the action after the family members and Delaware County entered into a confidential agreement.\nAsked about how the accomplishments fare against this court action, D’Amico said, “It’s how you react.”\nHe noted that many times, nursing homes are only noted for bad things as evident by advertisements asking the public about suing nursing homes.\n“For years, county homes were known as the last stand,” D’Amico said. “We were known as this is the last place to go. We changed that dynamic in Delaware County.”\nHe gave special notice to his staff for making that happen.\n“They worked very hard to get to where we are today,” D’Amico said.\nReuther noted the vulnerable populations served by the facility and all those who work at Fair Acres.\n“It’s 98% Medicaid,” she said. “That’s 98% of people who aren’t private pay or eligible for Medicare. It’s paid for out of medical assistance for the elderly. It is a huge part of our safety net and to have such a tremendously competent facility doing that kind of work is really important and impressive.”\nFair Acres is licensed for 774 beds but has been limited as renovations have been occurring on the top three floors of Building 8 on its campus. On Thursday, county officials plan to host a ribbon cutting to symbolize the completion of renovations to meet the updated fire code and allowing for another 110 beds to open.",

    "title": "Robot Dogs Protect Lives Through Innovation",
    "text": "BARKSDALE AIR FORCE BASE, La. — “These robot dogs not only have the potential to save Airmen’s lives, but they also serve as a reminder of how valuable your voice is, regardless of rank.” Master Sgt. Dominic Garcia, the emergency management flight chief from the 2nd Civil Engineer Squadron, devised the concept of robot dogs and while he advanced his idea into building and testing the robots, he learned some valuable lessons along the way. Garcia is originally from Denver, enlisted in the Air Force in 2006 and spent most of his career working under Air Force Global Strike Command. In 2017, Garcia deployed to Syria from his home station at Dyess Air Force Base, Texas. After returning from his deployment Garcia reflected on his time in Syria. “I had a really hard time adjusting back, and when you’re trying to adjust back, you replay a lot of things in your head,” said Garcia. “You replay certain situations, you think; what could I have done better? What could I have done differently?” While reflecting on his deployment he remembered seeing canine teams on some of the chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear missions. He said while he considered the things he would improve; he wondered if there was a way to arm the dogs with detectors instead of sending an entire team into a potentially hazardous environment. In 2019, Garcia was one of six AFGSC Airmen of the Year award recipients and met people from across AFGSC. His networking led to the opportunity to bring the concept of robot dogs to life through the Air Force Work Project. AFWERX is an Air Force innovation program that connects Airmen with technology developers to turn creative ideas into a reality. While Garcia worked on his concept with AFWERX, he connected with the company Ghost Robotics who agreed to build the robot dogs. In 2022, Garcia and his team applied for the Silver Award Grant and they were awarded 1.25 million dollars for the project. Garcia said he was delightfully surprised as he discovered opportunities and programs as he progressed in his journey to make his robot dog idea possible. “All I knew up until 2018 and 2019 was, if you want something done, you have to wait for policy or requirements,” said Garcia. “I didn’t know that there’s this whole other side of the Air Force that allows you to fast track and get what you need, kind of at the speed of relevancy to the tactical edge.” Once the robot parts were ready and delivered Garcia and his team assembled the parts into two user-friendly robotic canines. The team tested the functionality of the newly assembled robot dogs before advancing to test their capabilities to tackle Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear materials incidents. The team tested the dogs’ CBRN readiness by putting them through radioactive sites at the Defense Nuclear Weapons School at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. While it might seem odd to build expensive equipment and then immediately expose it to extreme situations, this testing is necessary. Garcia created the robot dogs to replace Airmen in life-threatening situations and withstand dangerous environments. He also armed the robotic canines with detectors capable of simultaneously detecting various threats. Garcia and his team went to the Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah to test the detectors, sensor data feedback, communication, and terrain performance. Garcia’s focus while developing the dogs was to design equipment that could save Airmen’s lives both here in the United States and when deployed overseas. He said in addition to preventing Airmen from risking their lives, the robots could fill operational gaps and increase the manpower in hazardous specialties. Persistent to meet these goals, Garcia and his flight continue to test the robotic canines through further research and development. Throughout the development of his robot dog concept, Garcia discovered a new passion for empowering Airmen to share their perspectives. He emphasized the importance of listening to and encouraging different perspectives of his teammates. “We need to be able to say yes more and listen more,” said Garcia. “We need to be able to allow our Airmen, our sergeants, our lieutenants, whoever, to be able to give those ideas and support them because if you say no you’ll never know the return on investment. But a simple yes can have so many positive effects that we don’t even see sometimes.” Prior to his innovative journey Garcia said he didn’t know he could come up with a concept and receive the support to make it a reality. Going through this process opened his eyes to the value of involving Airmen at every level, encouraging them, and supporting their ideas. Garcia said that is the reason he wanted to involve his teammates in the testing and evaluation of the robot dogs. “This is one of the few times that we get to build by the end user, for the end user. Yes, end users test certain pieces of equipment, but very rarely do they get to build it out for an entire career flow for an entire mission,” said Garcia. “That’s why I wanted to create an exposure for these guys to show them that it doesn’t matter what rank you are, it doesn’t matter how much experience you have in the Air Force, we all bring something to the table.” One of Garcia’s flight members, Airman 1st Class Daisy Slater, an emergency management specialist from the 2nd Civil Engineer Squadron, has been learning from Garcia while they work with the robot dogs. She said she is grateful for the opportunity to work with Garcia and learn about the dog’s performance and capabilities. “I feel like getting to this flight, I’ve been given the opportunity to hit the ground running, so to speak,” said Slater. “There are so many NCOs and especially Airmen coming out of this flight that are making waves in the career field. And when you situate yourself next to people doing great things, it opens a door for you to also do great things.” Garcia said he is inspired by the adaptability and eagerness displayed by the newer generation of Airmen and he hopes he has paved a path for the many Airmen who have innovative ideas. “The robot dogs are amazing. I love them, and I believe they’re going to save lives,” said Garcia. “What we’re doing for the career field, I think is awesome because we’re the first ones in the whole emergency management career field doing this, but the more important message is, we need to be able to be more open.” By Airman Rhea Beil & Master Sgt.
