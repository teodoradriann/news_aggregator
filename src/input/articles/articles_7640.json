    "text": "O Dallas Cowboys lidera o ranking das 20 equipes esportivas mais lucrativas do mundo em 2025, segundo a Forbes. Com um lucro operacional de US$ 564 milhões, equivalente a aproximadamente R$ 3,4 bilhões, o Cowboys se consolidou em 2024 como o time mais valioso do planeta, alcançando um valor de mercado de US$ 10,32 bilhões, tornando-se a primeira franquia esportiva a ultrapassar a marca de US$ 10 bi.\nOutras duas agremiações da NFL, o Los Angeles Rams e o New England Patriots, completam o top 3. registrando lucros operacionais de US$ 286 milhões e US$ 261 milhões, respectivamente. Esses números reforçam a força da liga de futebol americano no cenário global dos negócios esportivos.\nDe acordo com a Forbes, as 20 equipes mais lucrativas do mundo acumularam, juntas, US$ 3,9 bilhões em lucros operacionais, representando um crescimento de 12% em relação a última lista. O ranking deste ano tem nove franquias da NFL, cinco da NBA, três da NHL e três da Premier League, destacando a diversidade de ligas que conseguem maximizar seus retornos financeiros.\nNFL x Futebol\nAs equipes da NFL conseguem receitas significativas através de contratos de mídia e patrocínios, que, em média, rendem US$ 323 milhões antes mesmo da venda de ingressos. Essa vantagem coloca as franquias do esporte em uma posição privilegiada em relação aos clubes de futebol.\nO Dallas Cowboys, em particular, não se destaca apenas por sua receita de mídia. O time também se beneficia de uma robusta geração de receita local, que ultrapassa os US$ 800 milhões, vinda de vendas de ingressos, concessões e produtos licenciados. Em contraste, clubes como o Barcelona e o Paris Saint-Germain enfrentaram perdas operacionais no último ano, mostrando um cenário desafiador para as ligas de futebol.\nAs 20 equipes esportivas mais lucrativas de 2025, segundo a Forbes\n1 Dallas Cowboys\nLiga: NFL\nValor: US$ 10,1 bilhões\nProprietário: Jerry Jones\nLucro: US$ 564 milhões\n2) Los Angeles Rams\nLiga: NFL\nValor: US$ 7,6 bilhões\nProprietário: E.

    "text": "Things Happen to Good People? By Tunji Olaopa No amount of condolences, prayers, sympathies and commiseration could ever fathom the depth of the grief of Papa Shyngle and Mama Stella Wigwe. And the reason is simple: no parents should ever have to bury any of their children. The reverse should always be the case. And this is a deep principle of humanity that is not restricted by culture or society. It is just simply the natural order of things. It is fundamental—and indeed a thing of joy for all parents—that they would be buried by their children. When the reverse happens, and one loses a child, then the entirety of one’s existence is shrunk into that indissoluble vacuum of pain and grief. The depth of that sorrow becomes bottomless when one loses more than one child. Since I heard about the terrible calamity that befell this beautiful octogenarian couple, I have come to fathom the depth of what Aeschylus, the ancient Greek tragedian, meant when he said, “There is no pain so great as the memory of joy in present grief.” This brief statement sums up the depth of the bereavement of Papa and Mama Wigwe: their minds would be clouded simultaneously with remembrances of the births of their sons, their upbringing and naughtiness while growing up, their struggles to raise them as godly as God would permit, their collective memories of moments of joys and happy events and incidences, their family traditions and Christian values, the successes of their children, and many more. All this while their entire being register as starkly as it can the fact that a second child just died with his family when they had barely dealt with the pain of losing the first one. But there is more. Papa and Mama Wigwe are solid Christians. I can attest to that. And they have been serving God for as long as my memory of relating with them (albeit from a distance) could permit. Since this tragic incidence happened, the first verse of the first chapter of Job has run ceaselessly in my mind: “There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.” This is my summation of Papa and Mama Wigwe. And yet, they lost two children. The story of Job is one of the most challenging books of the Bible. And its challenge is purely because of demonstrating one of the cornerstones of a deep theological paradox: how could a good God create a world that is filled with evil, or even permit those committed to him to be ravaged by such evils? Since God created the world and certified that his creation is good, how did evil creep in? The problem of evil in a world created by a good God has troubled Christian theologians and apologetics, from St. Augustine to Ravi Zacharias, for centuries. Losing two fully grown children that one had trained to such a period in their lives does not square with the joy of bringing them into the world and the sacrifices of upbringing. And yet, Osita and Herbert left their parents in the world. The theological problem caused by the life and trauma of Job in the bible also raises a larger philosophical question I will like to touch in this lamentation. For anyone who has read the book of Job and has witnessed the tragedy that good people have encountered in life, the question is: why do bad things keep happening to good people? Papa and Mama Wigwe are good people. Both have been together for 56 six years, more than five decades of a love story sweetened by the birth of six children, including Osita and Herbert. When in an interview, Papa reminisced about Osita— “That boy was one in a million. He had the attributes of a daughter; he had the attributes of a son. He was a solution provider to all family problems”—I have a deep and intimate sense of what Papa Wigwe was talking about. I encountered Osita as a graduate student at the University of Ibadan (he was then a final-year engineering student), and I knew him deeply at many of his beautiful and humane personality. Pa Wigwe was then the DG at the Nigerian Television Authority, and that was how I met him and Mama for the first time. Osita was a very brilliant young man. I know this because we were both members of the University of Ibadan debating team, and I had a first-hand experience of how an engineering student could be so deeply knowledgeable and magisterial in a field usually dominated by students from the humanities and the social sciences. When I raised the issue of why he was an engineering student and not in, say, the humanities, his response gave me a solid insight into the deep flow of affection between father and son, and how that led to Osita’s desire to follow in the footsteps of his father the engineer. During a period when I was still searching for an intellectual enlightenment, rather than a spiritual one, I was immensely fascinated with Osita Wigwe, his intellectual brilliance, deep family values and pure spiritual commitment. It was essentially due to him that I visited the RCCG for the first time in 1986, and would eventually become a staunch member much later. Which was why I was baffled and very confused as to how such a spiritual father could experience the death of such a godly son—the same way I could still never wrap my head round the death of Pastor Enoch Adeboye’s son, Dare. And then twenty-seven years later after Osita’s demise, as if God still has some unfathomable purpose for Pa and Ma Wigwe, Osita’s kid-brother is taken. Questions and more puzzling questions. Who knows why the Almighty would allow Job to be tempted? Who knows why sit-tight African leaders, the very incarnate of the diabolical, who sit on the people’s democratic liberation, would just not topple over and be transited? Job imparted an everlasting lesson that each one of us increasingly come to internalize and try as much as we have it within us to live with: humans are born to troubles. In philosophical terms, for Fredrich Nietzsche, “To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering.” This is one juncture where the pastoral calling would be a heavy burden for Papa and Mama Wigwe to bear. This is a time when it would be justified for even a role model with a spiritual responsibility to give vent to his or her doubts and frustrations with life and with God. This is a Job moment. It is a moment to reflect back to June 5, 1997, drag that reflection to the fiery trauma of February 9, 2023, and then try to connect the dots in existential and spiritual terms. Where could the hands of the Almighty be in all this? How could the meaning and purpose be uncovered? Eventually, we all—believers, agnostics and non-believers alike—must bow before the inscrutable universe, and the denseness of the mystery that pervades all we have to deal with in life. For Christians, “great is the mystery of godliness” (I Timothy 3:16). Great is also the mystery of why good people like Papa and Mama Wigwe needed to suffer the death of two sons. We can theorize all we want about why terrible and traumatic things happen to good people. And yet we must eventually just accept that we are powerless against the Divine Mind that crafted a world where humans have survived—borne on the wings of faith—the harshest, cruelest and most challenging of all trials. Indeed, there are those who have passed through the excruciating valley of the shadow of death, but received grace and mercy to look back in gratitude for God’s deep wisdom in holding the world together, and holding us together at the critical moments of our needs. Now close to their nine decades in life, Papa Shyngle and Mama Stella Wigwe have walked with God for far too long not to be able to recognize His presence at this moment of unbearable sorrow—no matter how dim that presence might be now. No matter how intrusive and heavy the question of why the hand of the Almighty was heavy upon them, they must find comfort in Jesus’ sorrowful lamentation on the cross: “My Father, my Father, why have you forsaken me?” Papa and Mama Wigwe are knowledgeable about the purpose behind the crucifixion of the Lord; may they be able to find a good grip on God’s wisdom that mold us all in the fiery furnace of life. Let me conclude this difficult homily with William Blake, the English poet: “Can I see another’s woe, and not be in sorrow too? Can I see another’s grief, and not seek for kind relief?” But I ask: How much sympathy, weeping, lamentation or homilies can comfort one in perplexing loss? We can only drown our grief in the assurance that God—the owner of the universe and our lives—knows what he is doing. When peace like a river attendeth my way, when sorrows like sea billows roll; whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say, “It is well, it is well with my soul.” It is well with Papa Shyngle and Mama Stella; it is well with the entire Wigwe family. *Prof. Tunji Olaopa is the Chairman, Federal Civil Service Commission, Abuja ( [tolaopa2003@gmail.com](mailto:tolaopa2003@gmail.com))",

    "text": "Harford and Cecil counties saw flooding Wednesday after heavy rainfall swept the Baltimore metropolitan area, the National Weather Service reports. Erik Taylor, an NWS meteorologist, said the areas east of the I-95 corridor saw between one and a half to two inches of rainfall. At the same time, some counties within the state, including Harford and Cecil, experienced two and a half to three inches over 72 hours. In Joppa, a car was stuck in flood waters on Winters Run Road in Wednesday evening, the Harford County Fire Department said in a post to X, formerly Twitter. Taylor said there were no concerns for additional flooding as “it looks like most of those smaller streams and creeks that were up are slowly coming back down.” On Thursday, there’s a high of 57 degrees expected in the afternoon and a low of 43 degrees at night. Friday will see a 20% chance of showers and a high of 51 degrees. Taylor said the New Year’s weekend will look relatively dry, with a rain shower popping up here or there. Temperatures will remain in the 40s and 50s.",

The announcement comes with a call for design and architecture consultation to create a trauma-informed, normative facility that incorporates centralized services and extensive program space.\nCommissioner Victoria L. Kuhn, Esq. emphasized the importance of this development, stating that the new facility will meet the modern needs of safety, security, and rehabilitation. The initiative follows Governor Phil Murphy’s 2021 announcement to close the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility and relocate its population to a more central and accessible location, which is projected to save the state approximately $166 million in deferred maintenance and future capital costs.\nAssistant Commissioner Helena Tomé highlighted the benefits expected from the new facility, which will foster a rehabilitative and dignified environment conducive to the reintegration of incarcerated women into the community. The facility’s strategic placement on a 33-acre site near major roadways and other correctional institutions aims to enhance family visits, staffing, and access to community resources.\nThe new correctional facility will share a location with the active Garden State Correctional Facility and is near the recently closed Albert C. Wagner Youth Correctional Facility. It is part of a broader state effort involving multiple agencies, including the Departments of Treasury, Environmental Protection, and Community Affairs.\nThe NJDOC’s commitment to improving conditions for incarcerated women has been supported by stakeholders like Bonnie Kerness, Program Director of the American Friends Service Committee Prison Watch, who expressed optimism about the positive impact of the new facility on the dignity and rehabilitation of its residents.

Upon arrival, officers found Manuel Flores conscious but lying on the floor of the northbound \"J\" platform.\nEmergency Medical Services were promptly called to the scene and transported Flores to NYC Health and Hospitals/Woodhull.

Flores lived Brooklyn. Further details about the investigation have not been disclosed at this time.\nGel Gun Drive-Bys Prompt Police Warning in South Jersey GLOUCESTER TOWNSHIP, NJ - Gloucester Township Police have been dealing with a surge of complaints involving juveniles and young adults using \"Orbeez Guns\" to shoot gel projectiles at people, animals, and properties. An Orbeez gun fires small, colorful, water-absorbing beads.\nOne notable incident occurred on Gloucester Township Day at Veterans Park, where juveniles reportedly used these guns to target animals. Another significant occurrence involved juveniles firing from a moving vehicle at pedestrians on Tuesday. The suspects, five in total, captured their actions on social media.\nToday, Wednesday, at 3 PM, police received additional reports of two males and a female using an Orbeez gun to shoot at unsuspecting pedestrians. This case is currently under investigation.\nIn response to these events, the Gloucester Township Police Department is urging parents and guardians to discuss the potential dangers of these toy guns with their children. Misidentification of these toys as real guns could pose serious safety risks.\nThe police are taking a firm stance on this issue, promising to identify, arrest, and charge those misusing the toys to instill fear or cause disturbance among the residents of Gloucester Township.\nArrest Made in Baltimore Homicide Cases BALTIMORE, MD - Following a detailed investigation into the homicides that occurred on June 2, Baltimore detectives have apprehended Munir Dawan Matin, a 36-year-old Baltimore resident, for his alleged involvement in two separate shootings.\nMatin is accused of the fatal shooting of 32-year-old Terrell Johnson-Smith on June 2, in the 900 block of Pennsylvania Avenue, and the murder of 34-year-old Jarmal Harrid on the same day, in the 500 block of West Mulberry Street.\nThe arrest occurred on June 10, when the Warrant Apprehension Task Force located and detained Matin in the 400 block of Fallsway. He was subsequently transported to the Central Booking Intake Facility, facing two counts of first-degree murder among other charges.\nThis arrest follows an earlier report of gunshots on June 2 around 5:02 PM, where police were alerted to the 900 block of Pennsylvania Avenue by both gunshots and a ShotSpotter activation. At the scene, they found a male victim, later identified as Johnson-Smith, with multiple gunshot wounds. Despite immediate medical attention, he was pronounced dead at the hospital.\nMonessen Couple Arrested for Child Endangerment MONESSEN, PA - A couple from Monessen has been arrested following the discovery of their children living in severely neglected conditions. The Monessen Police, in collaboration with the Westmoreland County District Attorney's Office, charged Jerimiah Roberts and Felicia Dugan with endangering the welfare of children, a felony.\nThe investigation began on June 10 when police were called to the couple's residence on Park Manor for a welfare check on two small children. Upon arrival, officers spoke with Roberts at the door, who stated that the children were staying at a relative's house and that Dugan was asleep on the couch.\nPolice subsequently made contact with Dugan, who led them to an upstairs bedroom where the children were found sleeping. The conditions in the bedroom were appalling, with feces and old food on the floor, along with flies and fleas. The two-year-old children appeared to have bite marks on their bodies and faces and were visibly dirty.\nA witness informed police that Dugan frequently locked the children in the bedroom to prevent them from roaming around the house.\nFollowing these discoveries, both Roberts and Dugan were arraigned and placed in the Westmoreland County Prison.\nThree Arrested in Kent County Drug Bust DOVER, DE - Delaware State Police have arrested three men from Magnolia, Delaware, following a prolonged drug investigation in Kent County. The individuals arrested include 19-year-old Algahgaa Ata, 23-year-old Maddyan Ata, and 52-year-old Khaled Ata, all facing multiple charges related to drug dealing.\nThe investigation, which began in November 2023, was conducted by the Kent County Drug Unit and Delaware Alcohol and Tobacco Enforcement (DATE). The focus was on three businesses: Ali Baba Smoke Shop and Ali Baba 2 Smoke Shop in Dover, and Liberty Happy Gas Station in Magnolia. These locations were suspected of being involved in large-scale drug distribution.\nOn June 11, detectives stopped a vehicle driven by M. Ata near Magnolia. A search of his car revealed a loaded handgun, about 17 grams of marijuana, and $5,915 in cash believed to be drug proceeds.\nSimultaneously, search warrants were executed at the aforementioned businesses and a residence on Ponderosa Drive in Magnolia. A. Ata and K. Ata were apprehended at the Liberty Happy Gas Station. Searches of the properties resulted in the seizure of approximately 1025.32 grams of marijuana and THC products, two handguns, ammunition, drug paraphernalia, and $158,523 in suspected drug proceeds.\nAlgahgaa Ata was taken to Troop 3 for processing, charged, arraigned by Justice of the Peace Court 2, and subsequently released on a $2,000 unsecured bond.\nprevious post Man Murdered Inside Brooklyn Subway Station Breaking News New Jersey Announces Plans to Replace Notorious and Dangerous Womens Prison June 13, 2024 Man Murdered Inside Brooklyn Subway Station June 13, 2024 Gel Gun Drive-Bys Prompt Police Warning in South Jersey June 13, 2024 Arrest Made in Baltimore Homicide Cases June 13, 2024 Monessen Couple Arrested for Child Endangerment June 13, 2024 Three Arrested in Kent County Drug Bust June 13, 2024",

    "text": "I was born and raised in Ghent, one of the bigger cities in Belgium. It’s a lively, cultural and very beautiful city.\\nWhen I was a kid, my dad had a side business as an antiques dealer, which eventually became his main job. He started out doing it from home and the furniture in our house was constantly changing as antiques and cabinets moved in and out.\\nHe often sourced objects from people who had passed away or were downsizing and he was an amazing storyteller. When he came back late at night with new things for his shop, I’d be the first to run down and hear his stories.\\nI think that’s where I got my love for objects with stories. I still laugh at my dad because sometimes he’d make up the stories. Later, dad got a shop, which was next to our house.\\n\\nDancing the night away\\nObserving art is something I grew up with. My younger sister and I went to a Catholic all-girls school. One day, when we were young, a nun overheard us commenting on a painting hanging in the church. We were criticising the quality of it. She told my mum she’d never come across kids discussing art like this.\\nFrom the age of five to 18, with a break in between, I was a dancer. I did ballet and modern dance and performed on stage. My favourite thing to do was improvisations on a Friday night; we’d put on music and one by one we’d improvise and dance away.\\n‘I thought I was god’s gift to China’: how Pearl Lam learned to be Chinese\\nAsian culture vulture\\nOne of my best friends was an adopted Korean girl. As a teenager, she had an identity crisis and wanted to study Korean. So, when I was 17, I joined a Korean language course with her.\\nThe professor told lots of fascinating stories about how he had travelled around Asia and slept on tatami mats. I was sucked into his stories. My friend didn’t stick with the course, but I did. I loved finding out about this whole new culture.\\nThat experience inspired me to do Asian studies at university. In 1992, I went to Ghent University to do a degree in Asian studies (language and culture), with my major in Japanese and my minor in Chinese. In the summer holidays I worked as a waitress in a cocktail bar and at a home for the elderly to save money to travel.\\n\\nBy the time I graduated, I’d been to China, Japan and around Europe. I loved to travel. It was a four-year degree and I took another year to write my dissertation, so I was 23 when I graduated.\\nDefinitely not Nick\\nMy first job was for a company helping move people in and out of Belgium, which made me want to move myself. In 1998, I landed a job in London as a shipbroker. I moved from a gentle world of mainly women to a male-dominated shipbroking world. It was a shock to the system.\\nI realised I’d never fit in – I wasn’t your typical British bloke called Nick – and decided to embrace being the outsider. Things got better in the second year, when a Chinese colleague saw potential in me and rescued me from a desk that I didn’t fit into. We worked well together and did a lot of business.\\nIn 2000, I was hired by a big Belgian shipowner and worked in Antwerp for two years. It wasn’t as much fun as working with my Chinese friend. I really wanted to go to Asia.\\n\\nWith a few years’ experience under my belt, I was able to knock on doors and get a position in Asia. China was going through a crazy building boom and shipping was at a historical high because there weren’t enough vessels to move the raw material fast enough to China to satisfy its appetite for iron ore and metals. The market was going crazy and they needed people.\\nIt was 2003, during the Sars outbreak, and no one wanted to go to Asia – except me. I had three job offers to choose from and I chose Hong Kong.\\nSpeed dating\\nA few months after I arrived in Hong Kong, I signed up for the first speed-dating events after Sars. I had a bottle of wine on my table for courage.\\nAfterwards, all the girls went to Lan Kwai Fong and on to Wan Chai. By that point in the evening my pickup lines were well honed, and that was when I met Jeremy, a journalist for the Jockey Club. He followed me to Carnegies.\\n\\nThe bar was giving free champagne to the ladies and by the time he got there I was dancing on the bar. He was impressed with my confidence.\\nWe got married in 2009, but after a few years we began to drift apart. His job didn’t work out and he had to move back to Ireland, and that was the final blow to our relationship. We still talk from time to time and are friends.\\nThe Blue Lotus is born\\nI worked for a shipping company for a few years, then had a short stint in Shanghai and came back to Hong Kong. I gave up shipping and went to work for an antique dealer, but I didn’t think there was a future in antiques.\\nOn Sundays, I painted at an artist friend’s studio in Fo Tan. He suggested I buy a space in Fo Tan. You could get a 1,500 square foot (140 square metre) unit for under HK$1 million at the time. So, with one of the first good bonuses I got from shipping, I bought one of the industrial units.\\n\\nIt was a time when galleries were mainly showing Chinese and Vietnamese artists and there wasn’t so much interest in Hong Kong artists. I decided to show the artists who were around me in Fo Tan and who were also starting out, like me. That was the start of Blue Lotus Gallery.\\nI had exhibitions for Hong Kong artists who are now quite famous, like Lee Kit, Casper Chan, Sarah Lai and the ink painter Koon Wai-bong.\\nGetting the ball rolling\\nArtists told me there was something called the “Blue Lotus luck”; that if you had a show or did something in my space it would give you good luck. Some artists even snuck into my space to photograph their work to submit to a competition.\\nPerhaps it was luck or maybe it was simply the lighting, but the ones who shot their pictures in my space all got into the competition. The ball started rolling for me and many of these artists.\\nI quit my job, ran the gallery for a while, then ran out of money and went back to shipping. That went on and off for a while. It took a few years before I figured things out and began to make a profit.\\nTeamwork makes the dream work\\nMy life is a string of serendipities. Things just happen, and I go with it. After a few years of working with Hong Kong artists in different media, I discovered the black-and-white photographer Fan Ho.\\nI hadn’t seen his work, and he hadn’t had an exhibition for many years. It took me some time to persuade the parties involved to let me show some of his work in Fo Tan.\\n\\nSoon after that, I had to let my space go and was showing the work at a Christmas fair. Peter Lau from Asia One saw it and said he really liked his work. He owned an industrial building and had converted the 14-floor staircase into a gallery space.\\nI teamed up with him from 2012 to 2015 and our first show was a Fan Ho show. It was huge and attracted 3,000 visitors, which was massive for a space in Chai Wan in an industrial staircase.\\nFeeling the loss\\nI met photographer Michael Wolf at Asia One. We became friends and later I became his studio manager. Photography was coming to me from all directions, so I decided to work with it.\\n\\nBy 2012, Hong Kong had moved from being an almost provincial art market to an international one. It made sense for me to focus on something no one else was focusing on.\\nIn 2015, I reestablished Blue Lotus Gallery in Chai Wan for a few years. I recorded Fan Ho’s life story in two books. He is the artist who changed my life and encouraged me to stick with photography.\\nThen tragedy came. In 2016, Fan Ho passed away and in 2019 Michael Wolf died. I was very close to both of them. It was a challenging time.\\nPhotographer whose images celebrated Hong Kong life dies aged 65\\nIn 2018, I found a fantastic space on Pound Lane, Sheung Wan, which was everything I wanted, with a big gallery space, back room and outdoor space. Pound Lane isn’t a commercial location, but I’ve made it work and we’ve had some great shows that have had people queuing all the way down the steps and around the corner.\\nThe gent in Ghent\\nMy dad is in his 70s now and still has the antique shop in the centre of Ghent beside an old church. For the past two summers, I’ve taken an exhibition to Ghent and done a pop-up in the square next to his store. It has given me so much love and joy to be doing that with him for a few weeks each year.\\nIn 2022, Blue Lotus Editions published our first book, Thirty-six Views of Lion Rock. The books I’m publishing are part of a collection of Hong Kong visual stories. Each features a different photographer telling a different visual story related to Hong Kong.\\nHong Kong’s Lion Rock inspires French photographer’s homage to Hokusai\\nWe’ve done one on the MTR, another on abandoned villages and we hope to do one on neon signs, and we have a vintage project in mind. The books are from old Hong Kong and new Hong Kong. If you put them together, you will have a big picture of what Hong Kong is all about.\\nMany local people have told me they are glad I am still here and to keep going. That really motivates me. I am committed to staying in Hong Kong for as long as possible.\\n",

Los jóvenes no deben ser instrumentalizados para poner en práctica ideas ya decididas por otros o que no responden realmente a sus necesidades. No. Hay que responsabilizar a los jóvenes, implicarlos en el diálogo, en la planificación de actividades, en las decisiones. Debemos hacerles sentir que son parte activa y plena de la vida de la Iglesia; y sobre todo que ellos mismos son los primeros anunciadores del Evangelio a sus coetáneos\\\", ha señalado.\\r\\n\\r\\n Del mismo modo, ha asegurado que el discernimiento es \\\"un arte que deben aprender en primer lugar los agentes pastorales: sacerdotes y religiosos, catequistas, acompañantes, los propios jóvenes que siguen a otros jóvenes\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n Para el Papa, es un arte que no se improvisa, \\\"que hay que profundizar, experimentar y vivir\\\". \\\"Para un joven, encontrar a una persona capaz de discernir es encontrar un tesoro. En el camino de la fe y en el descubrimiento de la propia vocación, un guía sabio ayuda a evitar tantos errores, tantas ingenuidades, tantos momentos de desconcierto y de parálisis\\\", ha señalado.\\r\\n\\r\\n El Pontífice ha lamentado que hoy \\\"prevalece el individualismo\\\". \\\"Cada uno sigue su propio camino, cada uno atribuye sentido a la vida, cada uno establece sus propios valores, sus propias verdades\\\", ha argumentado.",

IMD scientist Soma Sen Roy said that this system is expected to bring significant rainfall to southern India. “Yesterday, rainfall measurements recorded 11 cm in Tamil Nadu, 6-7 cm in Kerala, and 9 cm in coastal Karnataka. Heavy to very heavy rainfall (12-20 cm) is likely in interior Kerala and south interior Tamil Nadu due to a deep circulation in the Gulf of Mannar area,” stated Roy, as cited by ANI.\nShe added, “In the rest of the country, weather will remain clear. Strong winds are expected in northern India over the next 2-3 days, with no temperature changes anticipated until November 3. After November 3, temperatures may drop by 2-3 degrees Celsius due to north-westerly winds.”\nIMD Advisory According to IMD’s regional office, the heavy rains could result in waterlogging, which may disrupt traffic and cause minor damage to some weak structures.\nRainfall Warning : 01st November 2024\nवर्षा की चेतावनी : 01st नवंबर2024 #rainfallwarning #IMDWeatherUpdate #stayalert #staysafe #tamilnadu #karnataka #kerala @moesgoi @ndmaindia @DDNational @airnewsalerts @tnsdma @KarnatakaSNDMC @KeralaSDMA pic.twitter.com/UZRDWcX7Pl\n— India Meteorological Department (@Indiametdept) November 1, 2024\nThe IMD advised residents to remain indoors, avoid unnecessary travel, and ensure that children and pets are safely indoors.
