(...). Consideramos que vuestra implicación puede ser de gran ayuda para mejorar las coberturas vacunales y, por tanto, la salud de la población», continúa la circular remitida a la institución colegial. [«Es fundamental resaltar que la vacunación contra la gripe ](https://www.diariodemallorca.es/mallorca/2023/10/11/vacunas-gripe-covid-mallorca-fechas-93217075.html)(...) está [abierta a toda la población balear](https://www.diariodemallorca.es/mallorca/2023/12/18/vacunar-gripe-poblacion-baleares-95986415.html).

Es conveniente recordar que, en la actualidad, a los menores de entre 2 y 17 años la vacuna de la gripe se administra de manera intranasal». Por todos estos motivos, las citadas direcciones generales instan a las farmacias comunitarias a recordar a las personas que entren en sus establecimientos para adquirir antigripales que pueden pedir cita telefoneando a Infosalut Connecta (971 22 00 00) o «directamente a su centro de salud» (sic). Desde la Conselleria añadieron que se intentará vacunar de forma oportunista a todos los pacientes que tengan una consulta con su médico de cabecera. Consejos Con la bajada de temperaturas y el aumento de los encuentros sociales, debido a las fiestas navideñas, suben también los casos de virus respiratorios, como son la gripe o la covid-19. Por ello la conselleria de Salud, a través de la dirección general de Salud Pública, recuerda a la ciudadanía la necesidad de tomar una serie de medidas eficaces para preservar la salud individual y colectiva. Por ello, este departamento recuerda que: Las vacunas son seguras. Previenen las infecciones y protegen nuestro entorno. Seguid las recomendaciones de vacunación ante microorganismos respiratorios. Hay que cubrirse la nariz y la boca al toser o estornudar. Usad pañuelos desechables para contener las gotitas respiratorias o las secreciones y tiradlos después a la papelera. Lavaos las manos con agua y jabón o con un gel que contenga alcohol, de manera frecuente y especialmente si estáis resfriados. Usad mascarilla si tenéis síntomas respiratorios. Evitad ir al trabajo si tenéis síntomas de enfermedad, siempre que sea posible. Os recordamos que podéis pedir cita para la vacunación en Infosalud Connecta al teléfono 971 220000.

    "title": "Low visibility as fog envelopes Kashmir - Hindustan Times",
    "text": "Fog continued to envelope Kashmir for the fifth consecutive day on Friday, effecting the normal life in the Valley. The India Meteorological Department, however, has forecast improvement in visibility from Saturday (December 30) because of a feeble western weather system.Parts of the Valley, including summer capital Srinagar, were seen covered with fog in the morning, disrupting traffic movement and business activities.The MeT said that the weather would continue to be cloudy with dry with moderate to dense fog over plains of Kashmir and Jammu division.“There will be slight improvement in visibility during December 30 and 31 due to approaching feeble western disturbance,” said MeT’s Srinagar centre director Mukhtar Ahmad.He added that they expect light snowfall at isolated higher reaches on January 4.“Fog likely to continue till January 4 due to absence of any major wet spell. Overall, no significant weather activity till the January 4,” he added. Independent weather observer Faizan Arif posed on micr-blogging platform “X” that the approaching Western Disturbance was set to influence Jammu and Kashmir over Saturday and Sunday, but was unlikely to bring any precipitation.“Despite the chance of a slight improvement in foggy conditions over the next 48 hours, ...the forecast indicates that Jammu and Kashmir will continue to experience foggy weather, whether it’s shallow or dense, for the next seven days,” he said.Kashmir’s harshest winter period, “Chilla-i-Kalan”, began last week with the mercury dropping several notches below the freezing point at many places.While the day temperatures remain between 8°C to 12°C, the minimum night temperatures continued to remain below zero on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday in the valley.The southern Konibal area and Pahalgam tourist resort were the coldest at minus 6.5°C and minus 5.4°C, respectively. The ski resort of Gulmarg in the north recorded temperature of minus 2.5°C, the only place with temperature about 3.7 notches higher than the normal at this time.In Srinagar, the temperature was minus 3.3°C, about 1.2 notches below normal for the summer capital.The MeT update further added that the gateway to Kashmir in the south, Qazigund recorded a minimum of minus 4.2°C and the southern area of Kokernag observed a minimum of minus 2.6°C. In north Kashmir, Kupwara recorded a low of minus 4°C.Kashmir’s winter pans out in three stages, starting with the 40-day intense period from December 21, followed by 20 days of comparatively less intense chill (Chilla-i-Khurd), and final 10 days of mild cold (Chill-e-Bache).",

Le 15 janvier 2024, Charles Bordais, 44 ans, vient d'aller chercher sa fille Soane, 8 ans, à l'école. \"Je fais prendre le gouter à ma fille et je sens cette douleur dans le bras, l'épaule, des fourmis\". Charles est victime d'une crise cardiaque. \"Je prends le téléphone fixe de la maison et je compose le 115. J'essaie de donner mon adresse et je fais signe à Soane de prendre le relais. La suite, je ne m'en souviens pas\". L'émouvante conversation entre la fille de la victime et les secours Soane saisit le téléphone. Et commence à échanger avec Sophie Doledec, l'assistante de régulation médicale, qui prend en charge l'appel depuis les Urgences l'hôpital Yves Le Foll à Saint-Brieuc. Elle témoigne ici au micro de France bleu Armorique. Un sauveteur volontaire de SauvLife dans le secteur Soane pose le combiné sur la bouche de son papa pour savoir s'il respire. Elle demande à son papa de se battre. Au même moment, à 600 mètres de là, Philippe Le Du reçoit un SMS sur son portable. Cet habitant de Plouhran est inscrit sur SauvLife, une application qui rassemble des sauveteurs volontaires, mobilisables par les secours en cas d'arrêts cardiaques, près de chez eux. \"J'étais sur place en deux, trois minutes, je suis arrivé juste après les gendarmes\", se souvient Philippe qui est également pompier volontaire. \"Monsieur Bordais est là, en arrêt, au sol. On se relaie au massage\". Une équipe du SMUR est en route. Chaque minute compte. \"Le fait d'intervenir rapidement permet aux pompiers puis à l'équipe médicale d'apporter des secours qui donnent plus de chance au patient\", souligne Philippe. Deux mois après son infarctus, Charles a rencontré tous ses sauveurs ce jeudi 14 mars à l'hôpital de Saint-Brieuc et en a profité pour leur offrir des chocolats. Cette histoire est \"l'occasion de rappeler que les bons réflexes et la formation des citoyens aux premiers secours font partie intégrante des secours d'urgences\", insiste la direction de l'hôpital.

    "text": "Great River Honor Flight marks 15 years of honoring veterans with 68 missions and counting QUINCY (WGEM) - In a remarkable milestone, the Great River Honor Flight is celebrating its 15th year of operation, having successfully completed 68 missions to date. Since Veterans Day in 2009, this local Honor Flight hub has been dedicated to providing free trips to Washington, D.C. for veterans from across Illinois, Missouri and Iowa. Carlos Fernandez, Chairman of the Great River Honor Flight Board, expressed gratitude for the continuous support from the public, emphasizing that the program’s longevity is a testament to the unwavering support it has received. “The reason it’s lasted 15 years is because the public has been very supportive of that,” Fernandez said. The program has made a significant impact by honoring nearly 2,200 veterans over the past 14 years. The breakdown includes 430 WWII veterans, 525 Korean War veterans, 1,098 Vietnam veterans, and 61 Armed Forces veterans. Veterans from 69 counties across Illinois, Missouri, and Iowa have been recognized, with some expressing that it’s the first genuine “thank you” they’ve received. Marine Vietnam Veteran Leslie Lair shared his perspective on the emotional experience. “When you go out as a veteran, it’s a whole new ballgame,” Lair said. “It’s something you don’t realize the emotions are there until you do it with other veterans.” The Great River Honor Flight has served as a unique opportunity for veterans to receive the appreciation they may not have felt upon returning home. “Many of them don’t think they deserve to go on an Honor Flight, which is foolish. They served their country, and that’s what we are here to honor,” Fernandez said. Looking ahead to 2024, the Great River Honor Flight is gearing up for six missions, continuing its tradition of honoring and celebrating the heroes who have served. The success of the program is not only measured in sentiment, but also in numbers. Over the past 14 years, the Great River Honor Flight has covered 120,904 air miles, visited 544 memorials, chartered 140 buses, served 11,694 meals, and distributed over 30,000 bottles of water. Additionally, more than 15,000 letters were handed out during mail calls. Vice-chair Sharon Lake emphasized that the mission is far from over. “Our number one goal is to ensure that all local veterans are aware of this opportunity and sign up for a future flight,” Lake said. Veterans who have served prior to July 1, 1985, are encouraged to visit the Great River Honor Flight [website](https://www.greatriverhonorflight.com/) and fill out an application to be added to the list for upcoming trips.
