    "title": "Friends and family mourn the loss of Canadians killed by Hamas in Israel",
    "text": "Friends, family and government officials have confirmed that at least seven Canadians were killed when Hamas militants conducted a series of attacks in Israel on Oct. 7.\nGlobal Affairs Canada has said an eighthperson who was not a citizen but had deep ties to Canada also died in the ensuing conflict. Another Canadian, who has not been identified, died in Lebanon during the hostilities.\nThe Hamas attacks killed an estimated 1,200 people and militants took another 240 hostage, 105 of whom were released during a temporary pause in the violence at the end of last month.\nAs Israel continues its retaliation on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, authorities there say more than 20,000 Palestinians have now been killed.\nHere's what we know about the Hamas victimswith ties to Canada:\nJudih Weinstein Haggai\nJudih Weinstein Haggai, 70, was out on an early-morning walk when Hamas started its attack, her family says.\nShe told members of her Nir Oz kibbutz that a militant on a motorcycle shot her husband and she was less severely wounded. The community was unable to dispatch an ambulance before militants arrived there.\nLast week, the kibbutz confirmed Gadi Haggai, Judih's husband, died on Oct. 7, and on Thursday they confirmed Weinstein Haggai also died that day, and her body is being held in Gaza.\nWeinstein Haggai was born in New York state but arrived in Toronto at the age of three, and moved to Israel 20 years later to live with her husband. She held Canadian, Israeli and American citizenships.\nWeinstein Haggai was an artist and a volunteer who the kibbutz said \"pursued many initiatives to advance peace in the region.\"\nHer brother Larry Weinstein said the family is distressed by Israel's offensive in Gaza and the rise of hateful speech in Canada toward both Jews and Muslims.\n\"We're inspired by my sister, who believed in peace and believed in harmony,\" he said. \"There can't be any kind of resolution when people are at each other's throats.\"\nVivian Silver\nVivian Silver, 74, was in her home on Kibbutz Be'eri near the Gaza border and talking on the phone with her son Yonatan Zeigen when they learned of the incursion by Hamas into Israel.\n\"We couldn’t grasp the incapability of the Israeli army to defend the civilians … we started to say goodbye because we realized this is probably our last words to each other,\" Zeigen later told a news conference organized by the Jerusalem Press Club.\nHe said they shifted their conversations to text messages so his mother could stay silent, and someone broke into her home. They said they loved one another before the messages stopped coming.\nZeigen said he had received information that she was taken hostage, and her phone had been geolocated in Gaza.\nOn Monday, his brother Chen Zeigen confirmed their mother's death. He said Israeli authorities told him the remains found earlier in the kibbutz had been identified as Silver.\nHe said his mother was born in Winnipeg and moved to Israel in 1974.\nShe dedicated her life to peacebuilding and fostering understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, he added.\nShe also volunteered to help children in Gaza access medical care in Israel.\nTiferet Lapidot\nTiferet Lapidot, 22, was a few days shy of her 23rd birthday and attending a music festival when the Hamas attack began.\nHer cousin Oran Zlotnik remembered Lapidot as a charismatic and compassionate person who had travelled the world, taught in Africa and spent time in Australia before she returned to Israel in the fall.\nHer uncle Harel Lapidot said she called her mother the morning of the attack to say she was hiding in a bush and to ask whether she should flee. Her cellphone was later tracked to the Gaza Strip, leading family to believe she was being held hostage. They then mounted a campaign to secure her freedom.\nZlotnik said that when the cellphone of one of Lapidot's friends, confirmed deceased, was also traced to Gaza, the family realized it was possible she wasn't a hostage.\nHarel Lapidot said his niece's body was later identified and the family held a funeral.\n\"We know for a fact they were hunted,\" he said. \"They ran away and they were hunted and killed.\"\nTiferet Lapidot was an Israeli citizen but her family was from Canada, including her father, Ohad, who was born in Saskatchewan.\nHarel Lapidot thanked the Jewish community in Canada and MPs who had reached out to help and offer support. The family had a meeting with Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly while she was in Israel.\nNetta Epstein\nIsraeli-Canadian Netta Epstein, 21, died when his home, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, came under attack.\nHis mother, Ayelet Shachar-Epstein, said he loved life. She learned the circumstances of his death from text messages he sent her in the moments before he was killed, and from his fiancée, Irene Shavit, who survived.\nNetta Epstein was inside a safe room with Shavit, and he jumped on a grenade thrown in by the attackers.\nShachar-Epstein, who also lost her mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law in the attacks, described it as a terrorist invasion.\nShe said her son, who had worked with special needs youth, had returned home two months earlier after completing military service.\nHe was born in Montreal and was a Canadian citizen. Shachar-Epstein said many members of the family still live in that city.\nShir Georgy\nIsraeli Canadian Shir Georgy, 22, was killed by Hamas militants who ambushed the music festival near Kibbutz Re'im.\nGeorgy's aunt Michal Bouganim confirmed the death.\n\"We are currently a mess, heartbroken,\" Bouganim said in a Facebook message.\nBouganim shared a 22-second clip on her social media in which a terrified Georgy was seen sitting on a floor, with her back against a wall and surrounded by other festival attendees — some of them injured.\nGeorgy's funeral was held in Israel.\nAdi Vital-Kaploun\nAdi Vital-Kaploun, 33, was killed by Hamas militants in her kibbutz near the Israeli border with the Gaza Strip, said the Jewish Federation of Ottawa.\nThe group's CEO made a statement on behalf of Vital-Kaploun's family, saying the dual citizen has a large extended family in the Ottawa area.\nThe family said she died a hero, after convincing her killers to spare her two young children and warning her father and husband to stay hidden during the attack.\n\"Adi was a beautiful woman that brought love and lightness to the people around her, but also she was very focused and determined to make a beautiful life for her family,\" her cousin-in-law Aaron Smith said in an interview.\nThe family said she was an amazing mother and wife, always bringing love and laughter to their household.\nShe was also a talented dancer, saxophonist and basketball player.\nAfter completing her master's degree in engineering, Vital-Kaploun excelled in her cybersecurity career, they said.\n\"We are mourning trying to process this unconscionable act of terrorism in her kibbutz and across the country,\" said the family, adding that they wish her memory to be \"a blessing.\"\nBen Mizrachi\nCanadian Ben Mizrachi was one of at least 260 people gunned down by Hamas militants at the music festival in southern Israel.\nMizrachi, 22, from Vancouver, was described as \"larger than life with a big personality\" in a statement by his former high school in B.C.\nEzra Shanken, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver, said Mizrachi was about to start university in Israel after serving with the country's national defence force.\nHilit Nurick, a home economics teacher at King David High School in Vancouver, remembered Mizrachi as a \"kind, wonderful, and community-minded\" young man who had a positive influence on everyone around him.\nNurick said she and Mizrachi once put a large event together for more than 100 people at school.\n\"He was in charge of making Moroccan-style spicy fish stew. He brought his mother's recipe and shared it with everyone and taught us how to make it,\" said Nurick. \"He was incredible, just an incredible human being.\"\nAlexandre Look\nAlexandre Look, who had recently celebrated his 33rd birthday, was among those killed while attending the musical festival.\nLook, who lived in Montreal with his family before moving to Mexico, died a hero, his dad said in a Facebook post.\n\"Like a true warrior he left as a hero wanting to protect the people he was with,\" Alain Haim Look said.\nFriend Lior Horovitz described him as a \"once-in-a-lifetime person\" who became like family during their five-year friendship.\nIn a phone interview from a town outside Tel Aviv, she said she and her boyfriend met Alexandre Look in Mexico. They became fast friends and would organize their vacations to meet up, either in Mexico or Israel.\nHe was a proud Jewish Canadian and a generous person who would do anything for his friends, she said.\n\"He's a person who loves people,\" she said. \"He's the guy that's always going to help others, especially if they are Jewish.\"\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2023.\nThe Canadian Press",

    "text": "Puebla enfrenta una grave crisis ambiental debido a la contaminación del río Atoyac y la presa de Valsequillo, dos de los principales focos de atención. Estos cuerpos de agua, fundamentales tanto para el ecosistema local como para la agricultura, presentan un nivel de contaminación severo que afecta a miles de personas y pone en riesgo la salud pública.\nÚNETE A NUESTRO CANAL DE WHATSAPP. EL PODER DE LA INFORMACIÓN EN LA PALMA DE TU MANO\nEl río Atoyac, que atraviesa 70 municipios y abarca más de 4 mil km², es uno de los cuerpos de agua más contaminados de la región. Según un informe del Consejo Nacional de Humanidades, Ciencias y Tecnologías (Conahcyt), se han detectado metales pesados, así como microplásticos, los cuales están vinculados a enfermedades graves como la leucemia y complicaciones renales.\nSÍGUENOS EN EL SHOWCASE DE GOOGLE NEWS\nPobladores revelan cómo es vivir cerca del Atoyac\nFrida, Gonzalo y Andrea viven cerca del río Atoyac, uno de los más contaminados del país. La queja más recurrente entre los habitantes es el intenso olor que emana del afluente.\n“A partir de que yo empecé a vivir en esta zona, pues ya el río está muy descuidado, los olores son muy fuertes, además cuando hace calor es cuando los olores empiezan a salir, pero gentes anteriores o personas ya muy muy grandes que vivieron acá (dicen) que sí era un río muy bonito, pero desgraciadamente todo lo que echaron las fábricas que empezaron a hacer los desagües, pues descompusieron la zona”, relató Andrea Flores en entrevista con La Silla Rota. Ella lleva 23 años trabajando en una ferretería a dos cuadras del río en la Ciudad de Puebla.\nPor su parte, Gonzalo, de 50 años, ha vivido toda su vida en la zona y atiende su miscelánea \"La Conchita\", ubicada a una cuadra del afluente. Se queja no solo del olor, sino también de la proliferación de ratas en la zona.\nFrida, quien ha residido durante 18 años a orillas del río, ha experimentado dolores de cabeza constantes, además de enrojecimiento en la piel, sobre todo en brazos y espalda. Al principio, atribuyó estas molestias a su sudor, pero el Gobierno de Puebla ha advertido que la exposición al Atoyac puede provocar irritación cutánea y cefaleas recurrentes.\nOtros síntomas comunes entre los habitantes de la zona incluyen náuseas, fiebre repentina, mareos, vómito, dolor abdominal y diarrea. La combinación de estos malestares es motivo suficiente para acudir a una unidad médica cercana.\nAdemás del olor, Frida advierte otro peligro: la acumulación de basura y el aumento del nivel del río debido a la contaminación. Hace cinco años se instaló una alarma para alertar cuando el nivel del agua subiera, pero no funciona.\n¿Cómo afecta a la salud vivir cerca del Atoyac?\nLa doctora Dolores Pérez tiene una farmacia y consultorio cerca del río Atoyac, entre los límites de San Andrés Cholula y Puebla. Ha trabajado en la zona durante 10 años, pero ha vivido allí toda su vida. Recuerda que hace 40 años, cuando era niña, el agua del río aún era \"clarita\".\nSegún el informe del Consejo Nacional de Humanidades, Ciencias y Tecnologías, en la cuenca Alta Atoyac se han identificado metales pesados como cromo, cadmio y mercurio, así como microplásticos. Estos contaminantes están relacionados con enfermedades graves, como leucemia, especialmente en niños. Además, el simple contacto con el agua puede causar náuseas, fiebre, mareos, vómito, irritación de la piel y problemas gastrointestinales.\nLa doctora Pérez recuerda el caso de un joven de 17 años que vivía cerca del río y fue diagnosticado con leucemia. Aunque se recuperó, recientemente tuvo una recaída y sigue residiendo en la misma zona.\n“Cuando lo mandamos a hacer estudios nos dimos cuenta de que su hemoglobina andaba muy baja, entonces lo mandamos a hematología y ahí le detectaron que tenía leucemia. Y entonces ya se le dio el tratamiento, pero sí él vive por la orilla del río, pero no sé cuál fue la causa desencadenante de su leucemia. Como ya después lo empezaron a tratar en la oncología del Hospital General del Sur, entonces yo ya no supe cuál fue el origen de su problema”, relató la doctora Pérez.\nPor su parte, el doctor Benjamín Serena, quien atiende en una clínica cercana al puente vehicular de las Torres, explica que la leucemia puede desarrollarse por múltiples factores. Sin embargo, menciona que las zonas con alta marginación, donde el agua del río es utilizada para actividades diarias, presentan mayor riesgo.\n“La parte que comentas de la contaminación causa enfermedades como leucemia, sí tiene que ver porque, por lo que tiran al río. Uno como población, pues realmente no tira basura, pero eso viene más a grandes empresas, por ejemplo, este arreglado allá, viene creo que, desde San Miguel Canoa, ahí había muchas textileras, y tiraban sus desechos, tanto de la pintura como de la tinta. Eso se diluye en el agua, se evapora, y a la gente que vive aquí les puede causar a plazos, leucemia, insuficiencia renal, y es por esos desechos”, comentó el doctor.\nLa contaminación del Atoyac afecta a 3.7 millones de personas en 70 municipios de Puebla, Tlaxcala y el Estado de México, según la Secretaría de Medio Ambiente.\nLa doctora Pérez también ha atendido casos de alergias e irritaciones en la piel derivadas de la contaminación del río. “Sí, de la piel más que nada salen como honguitos, tiñas, todo ese tipo de lesiones en la piel. Más en los niños, como juegan cerca del río”, explicó.\nMientras que el doctor Serena advierte que quienes realizan ejercicio cerca del Atoyac sin usar cubrebocas pueden desarrollar enfermedades respiratorias y oculares. Además, la comida vendida en la vía pública y cercana al afluente se contamina con partículas suspendidas.\n“Por estar cerca del río, enfermedades respiratorias, rinitis alérgica, rinitis, conjuntivitis, porque acuérdate que toda esa agua que se evapora, por ejemplo, las personas que vienen a correr en la madrugada, bueno, muy temprano, ese rocío o esa neblina que está ahí también es por el río, entonces pueden tener conjuntivitis”, señaló.\nLas enfermedades que provoca el Atoyac\nDe acuerdo con el Conahcyt, en el 1er informe estratégico Cuenca del Alto Atoyac, este río “es uno de los más contaminados de México debido a las descargas de aguas residuales de más de ocho mil empresas, principalmente de las industrias química, textil y automotriz”.\n“En las últimas 4 décadas, enfermedades como la enfermedad renal crónica y las leucemias agudas han mostrado tasas de incidencia y mortalidad elevadas, en especial en jóvenes. Se trata de padecimientos con una fuerte carga asociada a la exposición de los tóxicos imperantes en la Cuenca del Alto Atoyac”, señala la dependencia.\nSegún el Conahcyt, entre las décadas de 1990, 2000, 2010 y en 2019, los estados de Puebla y Tlaxcala han tenido las tasas de mortalidad más altas en el país por enfermedad renal crónica en personas de 15 a 49 años.\nPor ejemplo, entre 2019 y 2021, la tasa de mortalidad por enfermedad renal crónica en jóvenes de 10 a 19 años en Tlaxcala fue de 2.7 por cada 100 mil habitantes, lo que representa un riesgo de muerte 4 veces mayor que el promedio nacional.\nMientras tanto, las tasas de mortalidad por leucemias agudas muestran una tendencia creciente en las poblaciones de 10 a 19 años y en los adultos mayores de las poblaciones de la Cuenca del Alto Atoyac.\nAdemás, “las tasas de mortalidad por enfermedades del sistema circulatorio, como los infartos de miocardio y los accidentes cerebrovasculares, se han incrementado en la última década en las poblaciones de adolescentes y jóvenes en un 23% y en 124% respectivamente”, indica el estudio.\nLos habitantes de esta vasta región se ven expuestos a estos contaminantes, los cuales, además de impactar la salud, han llegado a los pozos de agua potable, poniendo en riesgo la vida de quienes dependen de esta fuente para su consumo diario.\nGobernador promete el rescate del Atoyac\nEn este contexto, el gobernador de Puebla, Alejandro Armenta, ha anunciado un ambicioso plan de 500 millones de pesos para la recuperación del Atoyac y la presa de Valsequillo, que incluye la tecnificación de los procesos de riego en al menos 17 municipios y un sistema de filtrado avanzado para el agua.\nEste esfuerzo forma parte de una estrategia para limpiar el Atoyac y asegurar que el agua de Valsequillo se pueda utilizar de manera segura en la agricultura, especialmente en cultivos de hortalizas, con el objetivo de generar un mayor valor agregado para la región.\n“Más de 500 millones de pesos tenemos este año para la tecnificación, pero enfocados, focalizados a la limpieza del Atoyac, la recuperación del agua de Valsequillo y al aprovechamiento de los centros de riego, con esa agua que llegue a un proceso de filtrado con tecnología de punta. En lugar de sembrar maíz o trigo, vamos a sembrar hortalizas que le darán otro valor”, comentó en conferencia de prensa el mandatario poblano el 26 de enero.\nLa crisis de los rellenos sanitarios en Puebla\nLa contaminación del Atoyac no es el único problema ambiental de Puebla. La presa de Valsequillo y los rellenos sanitarios también requieren atención urgente.\nEl gobernador de Puebla ha señalado que los rellenos sanitarios son proyectos prioritarios, ya que solo una cuarta parte de los 94 existentes cumple con las normas.\nPara mejorar la gestión de residuos, la secretaria de Medio Ambiente, Sara Rebeca Bañuelos Guadarrama, informó que se están desarrollando Centros de Transformación de Sólidos Urbanos en municipios como Tehuacán y Tepeaca.\nEl 26 de agosto de 2024, se clausuró el relleno sanitario de Calpan por exceder los límites de basura permitidos. Un estudio de la UAM del 18 de marzo de 2024 encontró contaminación microbiológica severa en pozos y cuerpos de agua cercanos, incumpliendo la norma NOM-127-SSA1-2021. Sumado a los tiraderos clandestinos, esto ha agravado la contaminación del suelo, agua y aire en Puebla.\n¿Contamina Granjas Carroll en Puebla?\nEl 22 de septiembre de 2024, en el foro “Análisis sobre la problemática de la cuenca Libres-Oriental”, la investigadora de la UNAM, Miriam Lastiri, afirmó que Granjas Carroll contamina el agua con excretas de cerdos, en las que se han detectado virus, bacterias y hongos.\nLa empresa consume entre ocho y nueve millones de metros cúbicos de agua de la cuenca, lo que ha causado indignación en las comunidades cercanas. Sin embargo, el 9 de diciembre de 2024, la exsecretaria de Medio Ambiente, Norma Angélica Sandoval Gómez, aseguró que Granjas Carroll “no contamina ni el suelo ni el agua” y que “no tenemos ningún tipo de información ni denuncia por contaminación”.\nEl gobernador de Puebla, Alejandro Armenta, prometió reunirse con Medio Ambiente estatal para verificar si la empresa está contaminando y que “la ciencia lo determine”.\nPor otro lado, el 24 de febrero de 2024, la directora de Operaciones de Granjas Carroll, Magaly Tapia Santos, propuso reutilizar aguas residuales tratadas en la agricultura, destacando sus beneficios para el suelo y la reducción del uso de agua dulce y fertilizantes. También abogó por actualizar el marco regulatorio para fomentar prácticas sostenibles.\nSe intentó contactar a Granjas Carroll para conocer su postura, pero hasta la publicación de esta noticia, no se obtuvo respuesta.",
