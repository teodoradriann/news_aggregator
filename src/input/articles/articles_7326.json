    "text": "Elder Scrolls Online Xbox achievements made tougher with new Battlegrounds changes Players dipping their toes into Battlegrounds will have a tougher time with Update 44, as Elder Scrolls Online's Battlegrounds achievements are now much harder.Tom West Published 15 Nov 2024 FollowtopicsThe Elder Scrolls OnlineThe Elder ScrollsBethesda SoftworksLocal MultiplayerOnline MultiplayerXbox Series X|SAction-RPGTom West Players looking to embark on the monumental quest to collect all of The Elder Scrolls Online achievements will be in for a tougher time with a couple of the PvP-related challenges following Update 44's arrival. Alongside adding two new companions, fresh Scribing additions, and more, the core focus appears to be on PvP in Update 44, which makes some great changes for dedicated players but makes it a nightmare for achievement hunters, as it makes The Elder Scrolls Online's Battlegrounds achievements harder to unlock.The Elder Scrolls Online's Battlegrounds achievements will be a fight to unlockFor the uninitiated, Battlegrounds is a PvP mode in Elder Scrolls Online that sees small teams of players go head-to-head in objective-based game modes in dedicated arenas. Unlike the PvP zones in Cyrodiil and the Imperial City, Battlegrounds are entered via matchmaking, formerly pitting three teams of four against one another for round-based PvP fun. Update 44 adds a host of changes to The Elder Scrolls Online's Battlegrounds, which features round-based objective-focused PvP combat in arenas far removed from the massive all-out war found in Cyrodiil or the PvPvE experiences of the Imperial City. Since Battlegrounds was added with the Morrowind Chapter in 2017, the mode has always followed the Alliance War format of the other PvP modes, pitting the three alliances against each other with smaller teams for 4v4v4 bouts. With Update 44, ZeniMax is shaking the mode up, removing the 4v4v4 format (although we could see it return for in-game events) and replacing it with 4v4 and 8v8 game modes. The format change also sees a brand-new set of maps to replace the old ones, reflecting the two teams crashing into each other, instead of the hexagonal-shaped arenas we previously had to work with.There are only two Xbox achievements for The Elder Scrolls Online directly related to Battlegrounds: Most Valuable Combatant and Triple Threat, the latter of which is likely to become a massive pain in the butt to unlock for players uninterested in PvP and just looking to nab the achievements. Neither achievement was particularly easy to get before Update 44, demanding a good chunk of your time to get lucky, as there is a dedicated Battlegrounds community.The Most Valuable Combatant achievement in The Elder Scrolls Online worth 113 pointsEarn a medal score of at least 3,000 points in a single Battleground match.Following the changes, Most Valuable Player, which requires you to earn a medal score of over 3,000 points in one Battleground match, might be a little easier for support players and those rocking area-of-effect builds, especially in the 8v8 Team Deathmatch mode. With that in mind, the new map structure means the two teams hit each other head-on instead of a three-way frenzy of chaos, so your opponents will have a much easier time with resource management and managing buffs — the opportunities for picking off enemies during the three-way bedlams have fallen drastically!The Triple Threat achievement in The Elder Scrolls Online worth 156 pointsCapture three enemy Relics in a single Battleground match.As for the Triple Threat achievement for capturing three enemy relics during a single match of Capture the Relic, it is going to be far tougher now, especially as Capture the Relic is only available in the 8v8 playlist. Not only is there now a team of players defending the objective (instead of sneaking in to pick one up when a team was away fighting in the old 4v4v4 format), but you'll also have other game modes to play through while waiting for a Capture the Relic match. 8v8 makes it much easier for teams to attack and defend, so the likelihood of finding the relic undefended is very unlikely, indeed.Don't let the daunting achievement list put you off from trying ZeniMax's Xbox MMO, as it's a fantastic addition to The Elder Scrolls universe — check out my thoughts on why you should be playing The Elder Scrolls Online.More The Elder Scrolls Online stories: Claim your Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Perks for October 2024 Claim your Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Perks for September 2024 Elder Scrolls Online free Xbox DLC up for grabs in September Claim your Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Perks for August 2024 Free Play Days features three free Xbox games this weekend Xbox Series X|SXbox One Written by Tom WestTom has been playing video games since he was old enough to hold a controller, experimenting with a number of systems until he eventually fell in love with Xbox.

    "text": "Como una forma de contrarrestar la escasez de trabajadores para el sector agropecuario y la construcción, el presidente Luis Abinader ha planteado dominicanizar la mano de obra en el país, conjuntamente con la mecanización en esas dos áreas, para reducir al mínimo el uso de personas. Nos preguntamos, ¿Cuántos años se tomaría esa idea para hacerla realidad?, esto, debido a la cantidad de recursos económicos que hay que invertir para la compra de equipos que la mayoría de los agroempresarios y dueños de constructoras no tiene. Aunque el Gobierno diera préstamos a bajas tasas, se necesitarían varios años para mecanizar, porque esos equipos hay que mandarlos a hacer. Algunos agroempresarios tienen sus fincas mecanizadas y usan poca mano de obra.\nPuede leer: Pero no suelten la soga de la vaca\nCacao, igual a oro Con los altos precios que tiene el cacao en los mercados internacionales, algunos productores hacen la comparación de que cacao es igual a oro en este momento, debido a que ayer su precio a futuro (2025) era de 9,373 dólares la tonelada métrica. Especialistas en la materia sostienen que esos precios podrían mantenerse de 4 a 5 años más, por los problemas sanitarios ocurridos en África con las plantaciones de cacao. Para que los productores locales puedan aprovechar esos precios, tienen que mejorar la productividad de sus plantaciones, les aconseja el ingeniero agrónomo Víctor Hidalgo , director ejecutivo de la Comisión Nacional de Cacao. Eso se logra, dice, poniendo las matas que les faltan, con sistemas de riego, según lo permita la topografía del terreno y el acceso a fuentes de agua en las fincas y otras.",

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Madison County, Indiana from 1901-2000 was 29.7. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Madison County, Indiana experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Madison County, Indiana history.",

A equipa de Rúben Amorim esteve a perder até à reta final frente ao lanterna vermelha Southampton, momento em que o talento de Amad Diallo apareceu para resolver o jogo a favor dos homens da casa ( 3-1 ).\nInfelizmente para o treinador luso, a sua equipa voltou a mostrar as dificuldades habituais contra este tipo de adversários. É justo dizer, até, que foram os Saints quem fizeram mais pela vida no primeiro tempo.\nOs sinais foram dados e golo visitante chegou. Canto executado por Mateus Fernandes - mostrou qualidade em diferentes momentos da partida - e, após desvio involuntário de Manuel Ugarte, a bola acabou nas redes dos Red Devils , que seguem macios neste tipo de lances.\nInsatisfeito, Amorim mexeu rapidamente na equipa, contudo, melhorias só mesmo na reta final do duelo. Diallo, confiante e sem medo do risco, cavalgou e empatou a partida com alguma sorte nos ressaltos. Poucos minutos depois, o 2-1 chegou após combinação entre o costa-marfinense e Christian Eriksen.\nNa fase do risco, o Southampton facilitou em zona recuada e Diallo, atento, completou o hat-trick. Loucura em Old Trafford, palco rendido ao grande destaque individual da temporada.\nPrimeiro triunfo para o Manchester United na Premier League em 2025, com os Red Devils a subirem ao 12.º posto . Por sua vez, os Saints seguem com seis pontos e só um milagre e parecem condenados à descida.\nDestaques",

    "text": "Imagine a future where the bustling streets of Downtown Jamaica are not just a hub of commerce but a beacon of sustainable urban development. A future where affordable housing is not a distant dream but a tangible reality, thanks to the innovative Jamaica Neighborhood Plan. As I delve into this transformative initiative, it's clear that the Jamaican Government is not just planning for infrastructure development but is also laying down the groundwork for a comprehensive societal uplift.\nA Vision for Tomorrow: The Jamaica Neighborhood Plan\nThe Jamaica Neighborhood Plan is more than just a blueprint for physical development; it's a strategic approach to reshaping the socio-economic landscape of Downtown Jamaica and its environs. By focusing on the development of housing units near transit hubs, the plan aims to ease the daily commute of countless Jamaicans while fostering a sense of community. The introduction of Mandatory Inclusionary Housing is a bold step towards making affordable housing a reality for many, marking a significant shift towards inclusivity in urban planning. Furthermore, the rezoning for higher density build is not just a technical move; it's a vision for a vibrant, bustling Jamaica, teeming with life and opportunities.\nLegislative Amendments and Infrastructure Development\nUnder the stewardship of Governor General Sir Patrick Allen, the Jamaican Government has outlined ambitious plans for the 2024/2025 fiscal year, signaling a period of rapid transformation. The establishment of the first ever 24-hour entertainment zone at the JamWorld Entertainment Complex in Portmore, St Catherine, is poised to revolutionize the entertainment landscape of Jamaica. The operationalization of the National Identification System (NIDS) is a significant leap towards modernizing the country's identification infrastructure, promising enhanced security and convenience for all Jamaicans. Amidst these landmark projects, the government's commitment to amending several Acts, including the Border Protection Act, Customs Act, and introducing new bills like the Animal Health and Welfare Bill, reflects a profound dedication to legislative excellence and societal well-being.\nEmpowering Communities through Infrastructure\nThe Jamaican Government's infrastructure development plans are a testament to their commitment to not just improving the physical landscape but also empowering communities. The launch of 21 water supply projects, the Rio Cobre Treatment Plant project, and the New Social Housing Programme are monumental steps towards ensuring basic needs are met, thereby improving the quality of life for many. Moreover, the Southern Coastal Highway Improvement Project and the SPARK programme are set to redefine mobility and connectivity, paving the way for economic growth and resilience. The introduction of the Portmore Resilience Park is a forward-thinking initiative aimed at enhancing environmental sustainability and community health.\nIn the heart of these ambitious plans lies a deeper narrative of hope, resilience, and inclusivity. The Jamaican Government's comprehensive approach towards infrastructure development and legislative amendments encapsulates a vision for a future where progress and prosperity are accessible to all. The Jamaica Neighborhood Plan, along with the slew of development projects and legislative reforms, are not just strategic moves but a pledge to the Jamaican people. A pledge of a brighter, more inclusive future where every Jamaican has the opportunity to thrive. As we look towards the 2024/2025 fiscal year, it's clear that Jamaica is on the brink of a transformative era, one that promises to reshape not just its physical landscape but its societal fabric as well.",
