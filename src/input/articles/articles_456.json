    "text": "Up Next\nNBA\nWashington Wizards forward Kyle Kuzma is lending a hand to incarcerated mothers\nKuzma, the NBA Community Assist Award winner for November, is prioritizing women in his hometown of Flint, Michigan\nSAN FRANCISCO – Washington Wizards forward Kyle Kuzma averages 4.4 assists per game. But the assists he is giving to incarcerated women back in his hometown of Flint, Michigan, was recognized by the NBA on Friday.\nEach month, the NBA Cares Bob Lanier Community Assist Award recognizes a player monthly for their outstanding work in the community. Kuzma was named the NBA Cares Bob Lanier Community Assist Award winner for November. The NBA champion hosted an event on Nov. 26 through his Kyle Kuzma Family Foundation in which it announced it is aiding incarcerated mothers in the Genesee County (Mich.) Jail who are beginning the process of re-entering society. The foundation is donating gifts and clothing to the mothers and their children.\nKuzma and his mother, Karri, also unveiled “Kuz’s Corner,” two newly renovated jail cells where incarcerated women visit their children, and the Kyle Kuzma Family Foundation is partnering with I.G.N.I.T.E and R.I.S.E., both jail reform organizations, to help incarcerated mothers. With R.I.S.E, the foundation is also working is creating a program sponsoring moms in their first six months of release from Genesee County Jail.\n“We look forward to helping inspire women that are incarcerated to learn as much as they can within their stay in jail, [and to] get their certificates with I.G.N.I.T.E. to gain skills they can utilize when they get out,” Karri Kuzma told Andscape. “By renovating the two cells, we hope that will also inspire women to become mentors to others both inside and outside of jail and to help them be the best version of themselves.”\nKuzma is averaging team-high 22.5 points per game as well as 6.1 rebounds and 4.4 assists for the struggling Wizards (5-25). The sixth-year NBA veteran signed a four-year, $102 million contract with Washington last offseason that allowed him to give his mother an early retirement. With the departure of Wizards great Bradley Beal to the Phoenix Suns, Kuzma\ntold Andscape in July that as the new face of the Wizards he wanted to not only be a great player, but an important leader who is willing to sacrifice.\nKuzma has often shown he is passionate about giving back to the less fortunate. In November, the former University of Utah star distributed over 1,500 hot meals from Black-owned restaurant Henry’s Soul Café and a GIANT food store gift card. Kuzma has also previously donated to help cure the ongoing fight for clean water in Flint. On Nov. 26, he delivered a commencement speech at Genesee County Jail and invited graduates to a post-event holiday party where they received $60,000 worth of clothes with hope to inspire confidence and help them with self-care upon re-entry into society.\n“Kyle’s commitment to the organization and the city [Flint] is an allegiance that is really impressive,” new Wizards general manager Will Dawkins told Andscape. “When [new Wizards president Michael Winger] and I first sat down with him, he talked about what he wanted to do with his career. And that really meshed with what we were looking for. We challenged him to make progress as a leader in the community and on the court.\n“There are things that he is doing with his foundation with his mom that are really impressive. They’ve been giving back to prison systems, local communities, food shelters and schools. They’ve impacted a lot.”\nKyle Kuzma, 28, talked to Andscape following the Wizards’ 129-118 loss to the Golden State Warriors on Nov. 22 about why he wanted to help incarcerated women, the platform he has as an NBA star, how he is coping with the Wizards’ struggles, the imprint he is having in helping Flint, why he re-signed with the Wizards as a free agent, the responsibility that comes with being the face of the franchise and more in the following Q&A.\nWhat does winning the Community Assist Award mean to you?\nIt means a lot more to my mom for sure. It means a lot to me, but especially with just the work that we do and I do with my foundation, my mom is extremely valuable to that. And obviously I got the award, but just the work she does — the work she’s put together — is extremely valuable. And I just have a great team around me that helps me orchestrate all these things. She is the president of my foundation, so she does everything.\nHow did you come up with the idea of helping incarcerated women in your hometown of Flint?\nI’m just really thinking outside the box. I have a relationship with our sheriff and just the city of Flint. And through conversations about just different walks of life, just understanding prison systems and jail systems and obviously that ties in with women. My foundation tries to focus on single mothers and underprivileged kids. So, naturally going into jails made sense within that partnership…\nJail wasn’t a place made for women. And it is tough for women when they get out of jail and re-enter society. The man comes back to society from prison, it’s like, ‘OK, second chance.’ But for a woman, it’s like, ‘You’re a woman. Why are you in jail? Why are you in prison?’ And then you hear these stories and especially with jail, a lot of mild to moderate type of cases and charges that put people in. And it just worked out for us.\nWas there anything that sparked your interest in helping incarcerated women in Michigan?\nIt was sad. This one woman, she was in jail, pretty much a kid, and she was pregnant in jail, had her kid, had to give the kid to a family member, and as soon as it came out had to go back to jail. And one, it was cool to be there. We reunited them together, being able to see that, but just to hear that — especially for what she was in for — it’s ridiculous. So that just made me realize this is a field of people that could use some help.\nHow are you dealing with losing?\nI can develop every day. That’s what I focus on. Can’t focus on the wins and losses. Especially for us, this is a rebuild. You understand what you’re signed up for. But I just kind of get excited every day to try to get better because I have [gotten better] every year. I don’t see that stopping.\nObviously, along with the money offered, what made you decide to re-sign with the Wizards?\nJust to develop. I felt like this was the place where I could develop. And seeing the plan that Winger and Dawkins have and having those conversations, I thought it was perfect for that type of situation.\nHow do you carry the weight of carrying the franchise? How do you make it better?\nYou got to be patient. Patience is the No. 1 thing. Just understanding where we are and just the dynamic of being a rebuilding year, winning the rebuild. A lot of time rebuilds look ugly. It’s not going to be worse than this … so just understanding that and understanding [to] keep focused on the good habits — not only for me developing, but trying to help other people develop. Whether it’s the Bilal’s [rookie guard Bilal Coulibaly] or the Jordans [guard Jordan Poole], sticking with those guys and just being a leader and growing into a leader, too. It’s a bunch of those things, but it’s good though.\nI know it’s your hometown, but talk about the impact you’re making in Flint and why it so important for you?\nIt’s my hometown where a lot of people are forgotten. People don’t think about it too often. Very impoverished place. Being somebody that people know from there, I just want to give them hope and never forget where I come from.\nWhen did you realize you can make change with your platform?\nI feel like even in college I could make a difference. We used to do a lot of charitable things in college. When people meet you and a smile comes on their face from just meeting you, that just sparked something in me. Understanding that I could be somebody to help because of that, that’s really powerful. You can make somebody’s day when they can look at you, and it’s pretty crazy.\nIs the water issue improving in Flint?\nSame old, same boat. They got to rip out every pipe in the city. So, it’s not changing.\nAnything more you could do there?\nNo. Not really. It’s a government situation. It’s way over everybody’s head. It’s going on 10 years.\nIn terms of helping women in prison or the water crisis in Flint, are there any politicians that you are meeting in the nation’s capital that can help?\nYeah, for sure. That’s also a great thing about D.C. is just the lobbyist of politicians, the people you can meet there to spur change is very cool because D.C. is probably the most powerful city, not only in the country but probably the world. So being there has really allowed me just to rub elbows with a bunch of different people from a bunch of different industries. It’s all about meeting the right people.",

Y los asentamientos donde viven suelen ser soluciones temporales que entrañan carencias y complicaciones. Sin embargo, estas casas con fecha de caducidad a menudo se convierten en lugares donde las familias pueden pasar décadas. Es en este contexto donde nace el proyecto\n[#14](c14#c-14) ¿Pero quién te has creído que eres? Esto es Menéame, aquí nadie se lee las noticias.\nY da gracias si alguien se lee la entradilla\nTiene más pinta de \"refugio\" que de \"casa\". Imagino que la idea será usarlas en campos de refugiados en vez de tiendas de campaña u otras estructuras más endebles.\n[#5](c5#c-5) De hecho lo dice en el artículo. Se realizó con ese fin, para los refugiados que tienen que instalarse en algún sitio de manera temporal y acaban quedándose 20 años.\nSpoiler: el problema de la vivienda nunca ha venido del precio de la construcción, sino del precio del suelo.\nPor eso hay decenas de miles de viviendas baratísimas en Seseña y demás pueblos perdidos, y resulta que nadie las quiere.\nY como no te vayas a Seseña, una parcelita adecuada pafa instalar una casa prefabricada no te baja de 125-150K\n[#8](c8#c-8) Pero al arquitecto famoso le da igual, el ha hecho su proyecto de casita mona, que luego nadie puede construir porque no hay terreno, y donde lo hay sale más económico construir en varias alturas....\n[#13](c13#c-13) A que te refieres con viviendas viejas? Las de los barrios de aluvión de los 60 que suelen estar en barrios marginales a día de hoy o esas viviendas viejas de cientos de años que se encuentran en los CENTROS de las ciudades?\n[#8](c8#c-8) bueno si se permitiera poner estas casas prefabricadas en terreno rústico, podrías acabar con parte del problema.\n[#1](c1#c-1) el articulo pone hormigo, no se de donde sacas lo de chapa...\nPor otro lado la verdad es que el interior se ve bien confortable, realmente para una casa para una persona o una pareja sin hijos , yo la firmaba. Lo raro que veo ahi es que no tenga paneles solares en el techo.\n[#1](c1#c-1) si están bien aprovechados, puedes tener una casa de 1 habitación bastante decente.\nYo vivía en una parecida de 50m2 y de 2 habitaciones.\n[#1](c1#c-1) En Madrid mi colega vivía en 19m², segundo sin ascensor. Si abría la puerta de casa, no podía pasar a la cocina. Humedades en el techo. Edificio de corrala de 1900.\n220.000 €. Lavapiés.\n[#3](c3#c-3) esque lo idoneo sería usar una parcela en las afueras.\nEl problema esque en España no se lleva vender trozos de terreno tan pequeño.",

Данную информацию предоставило Министерство обороны России.\n\"О работе ТЦК могу сказать, что это настоящее издевательство над населением. Они никого не спрашивают. Полиция и ТЦК просто останавливают людей, сажают в автобус, и всё – тебя уже увезли. Человека могут забрать утром, и к ночи он либо на учениях, либо на линии фронта\", – делится Кокоха в видео, которое Минобороны РФ предоставило ТАСС. Также военнослужащий отметил, что несмотря на заявления о небольших потерях, в действительности их значительно больше, чем озвучивают официально.\nАлександр Кокоха, получив повестку, отправился в военкомат, где ему сообщили, что он должен «подписать документы». Однако на месте стало известно, что он немедленно отправляется на передовую. Солдат также добавил, что большинство тех, кто оказался в его положении, родом из сельской местности. Получив боевую задачу, они сделали два выстрела и столкнулись с ответным ударом мин и FPV-дронов. На следующий день выяснилось, что эвакуация будет невозможна из-за того, что не забрали «запчасти». Придя за ними, они наткнулись на морскую пехоту Черноморского флота.\n\"Нам предложили сдаться, и мы сложили оружие. Это было в Сумской области, я шёл первым из трёх человек. Там было тихо, это вторая линия обороны, и люди там даже не носили бронежилетов. Не ожидал такого исхода, но когда увидел ребят у края леса, они мне велели бросить оружие и лечь на землю. Мы ничего не предпринимали и сразу подчинились\", – рассказал Кокоха.\n-\nТелеграм -\nДзен - Подписывайтесь на наши каналы и первыми узнавайте о главных новостях и важнейших событиях дня.",

    "text": "Микропластик выявлен в сперме и фолликулярной жидкости — об этом заявили исследователи на ежегодной конференции Европейского общества репродукции человека и эмбриологии (ESHRE). Частицы пластика нашли в 69 процентах образцов фолликулярной жидкости женщин и в 55 процентах образцов спермы мужчин.\nАнализ показал наличие таких полимеров, как политетрафторэтилен, полипропилен и полиэтилентерефталат. Исследование не оценивает влияние микропластика на фертильность напрямую, однако ранее было установлено, что его накопление в тканях может вызывать воспаления, окислительный стресс и гормональные сбои.\nВсе образцы были собраны и обработаны с соблюдением мер по предотвращению загрязнения. Ученые планируют продолжить работу с расширенной выборкой и изучить возможную связь между уровнем загрязнения и качеством сперматозоидов и яйцеклеток.\nРанее стало известно, что даже самые современные очистные сооружения не способны полностью задерживать микропластик. По данным ученых, мельчайшие частицы пластика продолжают проникать в природу через сточные воды, неся с собой опасные химические вещества.",

А для школьников среднего звена эта часть речи — настоящая «головная боль».\nПредлагаем вам бросить себе вызов и пройти мини-тест на грамотность. Чувствуете ли вы себя среди числительных, как рыба в воде?\nВыберите верный вариант. Как, на ваш взгляд, нужно говорить в следующем случае?\nКак правильно?\nа)\nдве подруги;\nб)\nдвое подруг;\nв)\nоба варианта верны.\nНиже приводится верный ответ. Если вы сделали выбор, можете свериться.\nОтвет для самопроверки\nОпределимся с разрядом числительного. В нашем случае мы имеем дело с собирательным числительным. Такие обозначают количество как совокупность предметов (двое, пятеро, семеро).\nСобирательные числительные имеют одну особенность — они не употребляются с существительными женского рода. То есть нельзя сказать «двое подруг» или «трое сестер». А вот «двое друзей» или «трое братьев» — пожалуйста.\nТаким образом, верный ответ на тест — под буквой «а» — две подруги. Если вы ответили именно так, поздравляем! Тест на грамотность пройден!\nРанее мы предлагали пройти\nеще один\nковарный тест на грамотность, а также угадать\nзначение\nустаревшего слова.\nЧИТАЙТЕ ТАКЖЕ\nОлеся Краснова\nonline\nНОВОСТИ ПО ТЕМЕ\nЕсли Вы обнаружили ошибку в тексте, выделите ее и нажмите Ctrl + Enter",

    "title": "A Record Number of Americans Are Turning 65 This Year and Redefining the Milestone",
    "text": "More Americans are turning 65 this year than at any prior time in history. Today’s 65-year-olds are reshaping a milestone long associated with retirement parties and the end of productive years. They’re wealthier and, by many measures, healthier and expected to live another 20 years. A growing amount are divorced, and many turn their focus on what they want in this next stage.\nKen Dychtwald, CEO of Age Wave, a California-based consulting firm specializing in aging-related issues, said, “Being 65 is not just thinking about who you were, but what you might become in a new chapter.” He says our parents and grandparents weren’t typically thinking of new ventures and possibilities at 65 because they were winding down. About 4.1 million Americans will reach 65 years old this year, hitting a surge that will continue through 2027, according to an analysis by Jason Fichtner, executive director of the Retirement Income Institute and chief economist at the Bipartisan Policy Center.\nHe says that’s about 11,200 a day, compared with the 10,000 daily average from the previous decade. Robin Darrow, vice president of sales and marketing at Scentrifugal Events, turns 65 in a few months but has no plans to retire because she loves her job and also can’t afford to retire. Darrow, who lives in the Philadelphia area, helped found the company in 2016, which offers “create your own fragrance” events at celebrations and meetings. She says, “I’m not winding down; I’m just starting.” According to a recent report from the Pew Research Center, nearly 20 percent of Americans 65 and older were employed in 2023, which is nearly double the share of those who were working 35 years ago.\n“More are working and tending to work more hours,” says Richard Fry, a senior researcher at Pew, who conducted the study. Close to two-thirds of 65 and older employees are working full time, compared with nearly half in 1987, he says. They’re earning more, too, with average hourly pay reaching $22 an hour in 2023, up from $13 an hour in inflation-adjusted dollars in 1987, according to the Pew report.\nMany in this age group are working because they need the money now or want to build a bigger retirement reserve so they don’t outlive their savings, says AARP’s Carly Roszkowski. They also\nenjoy their work and the opportunity for ongoing learning and social connections, she says. Today’s 65-year-olds are wealthier than their predecessors. While significant disparities exist, the median net worth of those 65 to 74 was $410,000 in 2022, up from $282,270 in 2010 in inflation-adjusted 2022 dollars, according to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances.\n“This is one of the untold success stories of the modern economy: There is a lot more wealth as people enter retirement,” says Ben Harris, director of the Retirement Security Project at Brookings Institution and former chief economist at the U.S. Treasury Department. Some of that 45 percent increase in net worth reflects rising values of homes and retirement accounts. Not all baby boomers have fared as well: Those 75 and older had a 13% gain in median net worth over the same period.\nToday’s 65-year-olds have more to spend now, but fewer have pensions that offer protected monthly income. They have to depend on savings, investments and Social Security to last and cover expected rising caregiving costs, says Fichtner with the Bipartisan Policy Center.",
