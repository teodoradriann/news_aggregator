    "text": "Man to appear in court in connection with alleged stalking and making ‘murderous threats’ to female politician A man has been charged in connection with the alleged stalking and making “murderous threats” to a prominent female politician. The suspect, a man in his 20s, from the west of Ireland, is a member of a main political party. He is currently in custody in a Galway garda station and will appear in court in Galway tomorrow. The suspect, described as “highly intelligent and academically qualified” was arrested this morning on foot of a complaint by a prominent female politician. It is understood the complaint involves “murderous threats” received via email and an instance where the suspect turned up in person. A Garda spokesman said “a man was arrested today for an alleged offence contrary to Section 10(1) of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 as amended by Section 23 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2023, Stalking. “The man is currently detained under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.” \"Gardaí have charged the man (20s) arrested earlier today in connection with a complaint made by a female public representative in the west of the country. “He remains in custody and is due to appear before Galway District Court tomorrow morning Friday, 7th of June 2024,” a spokesperson said. An Garda Síochána said that as this is an ongoing criminal investigation, it has no further comment at this time.

    "text": "( MENAFN - UkrinForm) On March 7-8, 59 Ukrainian citizens and their family members were evacuated from Gaza to Egypt.\nAccording to Ukrinform, this was reported by the press service of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine (HUR).\n\"On March 7-8, another stage of evacuation of Ukrainian citizens from the Gaza Strip took place. Through the Rafah border crossing, 59 Ukrainian citizens and their family members (15 children, 37 women, 8 men) were evacuated to Egypt,\" the intelligence said.\nAs noted, thanks to the efforts of representatives of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine and diplomats of the Ukrainian embassies in Israel and Egypt, the evacuation was successful. The citizens have been accommodated in a hotel in Egypt and will be transported to Ukraine soon.\nAs Ukrinform reported earlier, on October 7, Hamas attacked Israel, killing and kidnapping both military and civilians. Israel responded by shelling terrorist bases in the Gaza Strip.\nA seven-day pause in hostilities led to the release of about a hundred hostages held by Hamas in exchange for the release of 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israel, and facilitated the access of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.\nThe Israeli army \"resumed full-scale hostilities\" after the Hamas group violated the ceasefire agreement.\nMENAFN08032024000193011044ID1107954484\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

The operation resulted in a direct and precise hit on the ship,” the statement noted.\nIt vowed that the forces would continue their operations in the Red and Arabian Seas as well as the Indian Ocean as long as the Israeli regime kept up the brutal military onslaught and a simultaneous siege that it has been enforcing against Gaza.\nPress TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses:",

    "title": "Oracle Reduces Cloud Workforce To Support Massive AI Buildout",
    "text": "Oracle cuts jobs in Cloud division amid AI expansion drive\nOracle has initiated a new round of layoffs in its Cloud Infrastructure division, a move seen as part of a broader restructuring effort to allocate more resources to artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. Employees in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) unit were informed this week that their positions had been eliminated, according to Bloomberg and Data Center Dynamics.\nThe company has not disclosed the exact number of roles affected, nor issued an official statement on the matter. However, people familiar with the situation suggested that several hundred positions could be impacted, with most cuts reported in India and the United States. Workers in other regions are expected to meet with their managers later this week, prompting speculation of further reductions.\nAccording to sources, the job losses span multiple groups within Oracle’s cloud operations — from the Enterprise Engineering division and Fusion ERP software team to staff maintaining data centres, project managers overseeing AI and machine learning work, and employees engaged directly in OCI’s AI initiatives. While some departures are linked to performance issues, the restructuring is primarily aimed at replacing certain roles with hires whose skills align more closely with Oracle’s growing AI ambitions.\nIn a June filing, the company had stated: “These types of restructurings have resulted, and may in the future result, in increased restructuring costs and temporarily reduced productivity while employees adjust to the restructuring.”\nThe cuts come as Oracle steps up competition with cloud leaders Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. All major players are racing to expand data centre capacity to handle the training and deployment of large AI models. To keep pace, Oracle has been investing heavily in AI-ready infrastructure and securing high-profile partnerships.\nLast month, Oracle signed an unprecedented deal with OpenAI to provide around 4.5 gigawatts of data centre capacity in the US as part of the AI firm’s Stargate project, an initiative backed by Oracle, SoftBank Group, and others to invest $500 billion in global AI infrastructure. Earlier this year, reports also pointed to a $30 billion-a-year agreement between OpenAI and Oracle for AI infrastructure supply.\nThe company’s fiscal performance has remained strong despite rising costs. In Q4 FY25, total revenue rose 11% year-on-year to $15.9 billion. Cloud revenue, combining IaaS and SaaS, climbed 27% to $6.7 billion, while OCI revenue surged 52% to $3 billion, cementing its role as a major growth driver. Even so, Bloomberg reported that Oracle spent more than it earned in the fiscal year ending May, underscoring the scale of its AI-related investments.\nThis is not the first time OCI has faced significant staff reductions. In November 2024, several hundred positions — many held by senior staff — were eliminated, with some replaced by lower-cost junior hires. That round was concentrated mainly in US operations.\nAcross the tech sector, similar patterns are emerging. Microsoft has cut around 15,000 jobs this year, while Amazon and Meta Platforms have also trimmed staff to redirect spending toward AI. Oracle’s latest restructuring signals the same strategic recalibration, reducing certain roles to make room for skills that match the next phase of AI-driven cloud growth.",

    "text": "[Saúde](/saude)\nBoletim da Fiocruz indica alta de casos de covid-19 no país\nA nova edição do boletim semanal Infogripe, divulgado nesta quinta-feira (19) pela Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), revela uma tendência alta de casos de Síndrome Respiratória Aguda Grave (SRAG) associadas ao covid-19 em alguns estados do país. É o caso do Ceará, onde um cenário de crescimento dessas ocorrências já havia sido indicado na edição anterior da publicação.\nHá indícios de que Minas Gerais, Sergipe e Rondônia também iniciam um movimento parecido. O mesmo ocorre no Distrito Federal. Os casos envolvem especialmente pacientes idosos, que são mais suscetíveis aos efeitos mais adversos da infecção pelo coronavírus causador da covid-19.\nO boletim registra aumento de ocorrências de SRAG entre crianças e adolescentes de até 14 anos, associados principalmente ao rinovírus, em quatro unidades federativas: Acre, Distrito Federal, Minas Gerais e Sergipe. Os dados do novo boletim são referentes à semana epidemiológica que vai de 8 a 14 de dezembro.\nA SRAG é uma complicação respiratória que demanda hospitalização e está associada muitas vezes ao agravamento de alguma infecção viral. O paciente pode apresentar desconforto respiratório e queda no nível de saturação de oxigênio, entre outros sintomas.\nDe acordo com a nova edição, considerando as últimas quatro semanas epidemiológicas analisadas, a covid-19 esteve relacionada a 31,1% dos casos de SRAG com resultado positivo para alguma infecção viral. Já o rinovírus representou 38,6%. Além disso, 7,9% estiveram associados ao vírus sincicial respiratório (VSR), 7,6% à influenza A e 7,3% à influenza B.\nQuando se observa apenas os quadros de SRAG que resultaram em mortes nessas quatro semanas, 63,6% estão associados à covid-19. A maioria desses casos que tiveram a morte como desfecho envolveram idosos.\nAo todo, o Brasil já registrou em 2024 um total de 78.739 casos de SRAG com resultado laboratorial positivo para algum vírus respiratório. Destes, 16,8% são referentes à influenza A; 2% à influenza B; 19,6% à covid-19; 27,1% ao rinovírus e 33,8% ao VSR. Outras 8.280 ocorrências estão em fase de análise.\nO boletim Infogripe sinaliza para uma tendência de aumento de SRAG em nível nacional. Em 11 unidades federativas, há sinal de crescimento dos casos no longo prazo: Acre, Amazonas, Ceará, Distrito Federal, Goiás, Minas Gerais, Paraíba, Rio Grande do Norte, Rondônia, Santa Catarina e Sergipe. Além disso, há tendência de aumento das ocorrência no curto prazo no Acre, Amazonas, Bahia, Ceará, Distrito Federal, Goiás, Mato Grosso, Rio Grande do Norte e Rio Grande do Sul.\nCenário em 2024\nFazendo um balanço do cenário epidemiológico de 2024, a pesquisadora da Fiocruz, Tatiana Portella, destacou que o país viveu duas ondas importantes de covid-19. A primeira, que começou ainda no final de 2023 e avançou pelo início deste ano, afetou diversos estados. Já a segunda onda, iniciada em agosto de 2024, teve São Paulo como o estado mais atingido.\nApesar dessas duas ondas, a pesquisadora destaca que, em comparação com 2023, houve uma redução de aproximadamente 40% nos casos de SRAG associados à covid-19. Ainda assim, Portella alerta para o crescimento dessas ocorrências no encerramento de 2024.\n“Neste fim de ano, observamos uma menor atividade dos vírus respiratórios, com exceção apenas da covid-19, que já começa a apresentar sinais de aumento em algumas regiões do país. Para as festas de fim de ano, recomendamos o uso de máscaras caso surjam sintomas de gripe ou resfriado. Também sugerimos, sempre que possível, priorizar ambientes mais arejados, especialmente neste momento de início de aumento do número de casos de covid-19”.\n[Economia](/economia)\n[Mais paulistanos pretendem dar presentes neste Natal, diz FecomercioSP](/economia/noticia/2024-12/mais-paulistanos-pretendem-dar-presentes-neste-natal-diz-fecomerciosp)",
