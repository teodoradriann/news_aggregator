    "title": "Gold price recovers as escalating Middle East tensions improve demand for safe-haven assets",
    "text": "- Gold price has extended its recovery to near $2,030 as the US Dollar turns sideways.\n- A pullback move in the Gold price is less convincing as traders have pared bets for a Fed rate cut in March.\n- Upbeat US Retail Sales numbers signal upside risks to US inflation.\nGold price (XAU/USD) rises further on Friday’s European session as the appeal for safe-haven assets improves due to the deepening Middle East conflict. Adding to the war in Gaza, tensions between Houthi rebels and the United States military are increasing in the key commercial shipping route crossing the Red Sea. Moreover, Pakistan carried out military strikes in Iran on Thursday following a similar attack by Iran in its territory.\nIn this context, the precious metal has recovered significantly, but the outlook in the near term has not turned bullish as further upside looks capped by diminishing bets supporting an interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed.)\nThe outlook for inflation in the United States remains uncertain. Price growth is gradually declining, but recent data suggests that the economy is strong, particularly due to robust household spending. This adds to inflation pressures and makes it more likely that the Fed will maintain a restrictive\nmonetary policy stance for a longer period.\nThe Fed is expected to keep interest\nrates unchanged in the range of 5.25%-5.50% for the fourth consecutive time at the monetary policy meeting on January 31. Market participants will focus on the commentary about how the Fed will fit the expected three interest rate cuts in the remaining seven policy meetings of 2024.\nDaily digest market movers: Gold price recovers further as US Dollar remains subdued\n- Gold price extends recovery to near $2,030 as the US Dollar has turned sideways after a strong upside move.\n- The recovery in the Gold price is also backed by deepening geopolitical tensions, which have increased flows towards safe-haven assets.\n- The appeal for safe-haven assets is upbeat as the Iran military group is expected to retaliate for airstrikes launched by the US military targeting Houthis in Yemen.\n- In spite of supportive economic fundamentals, the Gold price is expected to end the week on a bearish note, weighed by lower Fed rate cuts bets due to a stable labor market, robust consumer spending, and a sticky inflation outlook.\n- US Retail Sales were robust in December due to a sharp increase in demand for motor vehicles and online purchases, which set a positive undertone for 2024. An upbeat retail demand has escalated fears for inflation remaining persistent.\n- US Initial Jobless Claims for the week ending January 12 fell significantly lower to 187K against expectations of 203K and the prior reading of 207K. This indicates that labor demand is upbeat despite the Fed maintaining interest rates at high levels.\n- Strong economic data strengthens the argument supporting a restrictive interest rate environment.\n- On Thursday, Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic supported a reduction in interest rates, but only after the first half of this year as long as inflation declines towards the 2% target.\n- Bostic cautioned about premature interest rate cuts as they could decelerate the progress in the achievement of price stability. Also, early rate cuts could bring an uptick in retail demand and spoil entire efforts made to tame price pressures. Bostic endorsed two interest rate cuts this year, diverging from the Fed’s median projections of three rate cuts.\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY) sees a sharp contraction in volatility around 103.40. The USD Index trades slightly below its monthly high of 103.70, but it is expected to extend its recent recovery as investors scale back interest rate cut bets for March.\n- As per the CME Group Fedwatch tool, traders see a 53% chance for an interest rate cut by 25 bps in March, sharply down from the above 70% seen last week.\nTechnical Analysis: Gold price recovers from 50-day EMA\nGold price jumped to near $2,030 on Friday. The precious metal recovered strongly after finding buying interest near the psychological support of $2,000. The yellow metal rebounded after taking support from the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which trades around $2,017. However, the 20-day EMA near $2,035 is still acting as a barrier for the Gold price bulls. The 14-period Relative Strength Index (RSI) rebounded after testing territory near 40.00.\nMore upside could appear if\nGold manages to stabilize above the $2,030 resistance, while the downside move could gain traction on a breakdown below the psychological supportof $2,000.\nGold FAQs\nWhy do people invest in Gold?\nGold has played a key role in human’s history as it has been widely used as a store of value and medium of exchange. Currently, apart from its shine and usage for jewelry, the precious metal is widely seen as a safe-haven asset, meaning that it is considered a good investment during turbulent times. Gold is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and against depreciating currencies as it doesn’t rely on any specific issuer or government.\nWho buys the most Gold?\nCentral banks are the biggest Gold holders. In their aim to support their currencies in turbulent times, central banks tend to diversify their reserves and buy Gold to improve the perceived strength of the economy and the currency. High Gold reserves can be a source of trust for a country’s solvency. Central banks added 1,136 tonnes of Gold worth around $70 billion to their reserves in 2022, according to data from the World Gold Council. This is the highest yearly purchase since records began. Central banks from emerging economies such as China, India and Turkey are quickly increasing their Gold reserves.\nHow is Gold correlated with other assets?\nGold has an inverse correlation with the US Dollar and US Treasuries, which are both major reserve and safe-haven assets. When the Dollar depreciates, Gold tends to rise, enabling investors and central banks to diversify their assets in turbulent times. Gold is also inversely correlated with risk assets. A rally in the stock market tends to weaken Gold price, while sell-offs in riskier markets tend to favor the precious metal.\nWhat does the price of Gold depend on?\nThe price can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can quickly make Gold price escalate due to its safe-haven status. As a yield-less asset, Gold tends to rise with lower interest rates, while higher cost of money usually weighs down on the yellow metal. Still, most moves depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAU/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Gold controlled, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to push Gold prices up.\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

    "text": "Iglesia católica rechaza que el aborto sea un derecho en México\nAGENCIAS\nEn su editorial dominical 'Desde la Fe', la Iglesia católica de México rechazó que el aborto sea un derecho en el país y pidió que no se \"aproveche\" el caso mediático de un bebé abandonado en la calle para \"aprobar\" la interrupción del embarazo, pese a las leyes que la permiten y las sentencias de la Suprema Corte que impiden su criminalización.\nLa arquidiócesis citó el caso de un recién nacido que fue abandonado el martes pasado en la vía pública en el municipio de Tultitlán, el central Estado de México, quien sobrevivió, mientras sus jóvenes padres enfrentan cargos por tentativa de homicidio.\nLa Iglesia reclamó que \"los bebés no tienen la culpa\", ante \"quienes intentan argumentar que para evitar una situación como esta, se debe aprobar el aborto\".\n\"La publicidad engañosa hace creer que el aborto es un derecho”, insistió la Arquidiócesis mexicana, y calificó la interrupción del embarazo como una práctica de \"muerte\".\n\"El aborto es una práctica en la que hay una muerte, la del ser humano en desarrollo, legal o no, la muerte es un hecho\", consideró.\nNo obstante, desde 2021, la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación (SCJN) determinó la inconstitucionalidad del delito de aborto en todo el país, obligando a los estados a reformar sus legislaciones y a garantizar el acceso a servicios seguros de interrupción del embarazo hasta las 12 semanas.\nEste caso ha generado controversia en el país por la desinformación en torno a los métodos para el aborto seguro y los plazos que ONG consideran insuficientes para acceder al servicio.\nLa arquidiócesis resaltó que este suceso \"además de tratarse de un acto de crueldad, también es ilegal, por haberse intentado en meses de embarazo avanzado\".\nSin embargo, en el Estado de México el aborto voluntario fue despenalizado apenas en noviembre de 2024, generando un retraso en la garantía de los servicios para las mujeres y personas gestantes que requieran interrumpir un embarazo.\nOrganizaciones civiles, como Human Rights Watch (HRW), han advertido que la criminalización social sigue siendo una de las principales barreras que obstruyen el acceso a la interrupción segura del embarazo en todo el país.\nHasta ahora, 21 de los 32 estados del país han despenalizado el aborto como decisión voluntaria antes de la semana 12 (y en Sinaloa, 13), en sintonía con la sentencia de la Corte que hace dos años determinó que prohibir la interrupción del embarazo viola los derechos a la dignidad humana, autonomía reproductiva, salud e igualdad, entre otros.\nEn los 11 estados restantes, el aborto está permitido en cualquier momento del embarazo solo en casos de agresión sexual y otras causales legales, como peligro de muerte o daños en la salud para la persona gestante.",

    "text": "Press Release Minnesota Businessman Sentenced for Tax Evasion Thursday, April 25, For Immediate Release Office of Public Affairs A Minnesota businessman was sentenced today to 21 months in prison for evading the payment of federal individual income taxes he owed for the years 2007 through 2019.\nAccording to court documents and statements made in court, Robert Wayne Schlosser owned and operated Custom Christmas Lighting, a business that installs Christmas lighting, special event lighting and decoration displays for its customers. In 2018, Schlosser filed for bankruptcy and listed the IRS as a creditor. At that time, Schlosser had unpaid debts due to the IRS going back to 2007.\nAs part of his bankruptcy, Schlosser was required to sign and file, under penalty of perjury, a bankruptcy petition and schedules providing information regarding his assets, income and other financial affairs. But the schedules he filed contained materially false statements and omissions regarding his assets and income. Schlosser also testified during bankruptcy proceedings and made materially false statements, specifically about his ownership of two speedboats. Schlosser evaded payment of his federal income taxes by filing false bankruptcy schedules and making false statements during bankruptcy proceedings that concealed assets from the IRS.\nSchlosser’s conduct resulted in a total tax loss to the IRS of $429,848.\nIn addition to the prison sentence, U.S. District Judge Katherine M.

    "text": "By Jonathan Stempel (Reuters) - The founder and the top doctor of a San Francisco-based telehealth startup were charged by the U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday with running a fraudulent $100 million scheme to distribute Adderall and other stimulants online. Done Global founder Ruthia He and clinical president David Brody are the first to be federally prosecuted in connection with alleged illegal drug distribution related to a telehealth company. Both defendants were arrested on Thursday, and could face decades in prison if convicted. Their lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Done was not charged, and did not immediately respond to similar requests. Authorities said Done arranged for prescriptions of more than 40 million pills including Adderall, which treats attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, by using social media to attract \"drug seekers\" willing to pay monthly subscription fees for ready access. Many prescriptions were not medically necessary, and allegedly exacerbated a nationwide Adderall shortage announced in October 2022, hurting patients with legitimate medical needs. He and Brody were also accused of conspiring to defraud Medicare and Medicaid by making false claims about Done's prescription practices to pharmacies, resulting in more than $14 million of payouts by those programs and insurers. \"These defendants exploited the COVID-19 pandemic to develop and carry out a $100 million scheme to defraud taxpayers and provide easy access to Adderall and other stimulants for no legitimate medical purpose,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. Founded in 2019, Done says on its website that its mission is to \"provide awareness and education for people to learn more, private and accurate medical diagnosis through telehealth, and actionable ways to receive immediate treatment.\" Tuesday's charges follow reporting in 2022 by the Wall Street Journal that some telehealth companies saw opportunities to satisfy growing patient demand for controlled substances, with some clinicians feeling pressure to write prescriptions. The government classifies Adderall as a Schedule II controlled substance because of its high potential for abuse and dependence. Cocaine, methamphetamine and the opioid OxyContin are among other products in that group. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by David Gregorio)",
