    "text": "By Lori Kersey ,\n7 days ago The West Virginia NAACP filed a lawsuit Thursday against the state Department of Homeland Security, Department of Human Services and the Department of Education, alleging they failed to collect data meant to improve the juvenile justice system. (Getty Images)\nThe state NAACP filed a lawsuit this week against three West Virginia departments, alleging they failed to collect data meant to improve the juvenile justice system.\nThe organization filed the lawsuit Thursday in Kanawha County Circuit Court. The complaint lists as defendants the state Department of Homeland Security, Department of Human Services and the Department of Education.\n“The West Virginia State Conference of the NAACP has long advocated for the state to address racial inequities in how young people of color are being treated in schools and carceral settings, including racial bullying, school suspension and truancy concerns in West Virginia,” Loretta Young, president of the West Virginia State Conference of the NAACP, said in a news release Thursday.\n“This data is an important tool in that work and by not collecting it, the state is hindering the NAACP from fulfilling its mission,” she said. “West Virginians deserve to have a government that fulfills its obligations — to know that when the state legislature passes a law near-unanimously and the governor signs it, the state agencies follow that law, just the same as ordinary West Virginians do.”\nAccording to a report from the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, in 2013, West Virginia confined youth at a rate of 510 per 100,000, and Black kids were nearly three times more likely to be confined than white kids.\nBetween 2006 and 2011, the lawsuit states, West Virginia’s rate of youth incarceration increased 5%, despite a national drop of 35%.\nFormer Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin signed Senate Bill 393 into law in 2015. The legislation had unanimous support from both chambers of the Legislature. It followed the work of a task force made up of lawmakers , law enforcement, judges, public defenders, teachers and others that Tomblin convened to work on juvenile justice reform. The panel found, among other things, that the state lacked information about youth recidivism rates.\nThe legislation required the state to collect data on recidivism, the outcomes of diversion programs, the outcomes of truancy programs and the proportion of minority youth who are involved in the juvenile justice system compared to those in the general population involved in the system.\nAccording to a report last year from the state Department of Education, about one in five Black students in West Virginia public schools were suspended during the 2021-2022 school year.\nYoung said the high rate of suspensions for students of color indicates that they’re being targeted. About 3.6 percent of West Virginia’s population is Black, according to 2020 Census data.\nYoung said that many children of color who are suspended are being punished for responding to the use of racial slurs or other discriminatory behavior used against them. All children, she continued, should have a safe place in school and access to equal education. When children are suspended and not in school, they don’t learn, she said.\n“My ultimate goal is that we would look at policies that would help administrators and teachers not to turn a blind eye to the use of racial slurs and name calling, but see that as a very serious offense and that they would develop policies and training for teachers so that this might be curbed,” Young said.\nAleshadye Getachew, an attorney with the Democracy Forward Foundation, which is representing the NAACP in the lawsuit, said the organizations previously filed broad Freedom of Information Act requests relating to all the data that the agencies named in the suit were required by law to collect. Some of the agencies had collected some of the data, she said, but none had developed procedures to make the data accessible and usable.\n“I cannot say enough about how important the data is, because the data could also show us what actions brought about better results,” Young said. “And we all need to learn. Data that is king in order for us to make policy changes.”\nThe complaint seeks to require the state agencies to comply with the law by collecting the data.\nThe NAACP is also being represented in the lawsuit by Mountain State Justice.\nRepresentatives of the three state agencies did not immediately return an email seeking comment Thursday.\nThis story has been updated with further comment from Loretta Young, president of the West Virginia State Conference of the NAACP, and Aleshadye Getachew, an attorney with the Democracy Forward Foundation.\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

However, there remains work to do,” Tyson Shtykalo, the province’s auditor general, said in the report.\nThe report found that while the provincial health organization has a cybersecurity incident response plan in place, training sessions are not held with all staff members, a plan for communicating with external stakeholders and procedures for responding to ransomware incidents are incomplete, and incident-response tests were not done.\n“Since no tests were performed, the effectiveness of the CSIR plan cannot be evaluated to ensure that Shared Health is prepared to promptly respond to a major cybersecurity event,” the report states.\nThe report, released Thursday, includes four recommendations to improve the incident response plan. Shtykalo said in the report that while the recommendations are directed to Shared Health, all public-sector organizations should bolster their efforts to respond to cybersecurity attacks.\nThe report comes after high-profile local cyberattacks at the University of Winnipeg and Pembina Trails School Division.\nfpcity@freepress.mb.ca\nCybersecurity incident response process at Shared Health\nRelated Articles ‘It’s affected everything’: cyberattack could impact Pembina Trails report cards, exams Pembina Trails School Division confirms cyber attack Additional groups affected by pre-exam cyberattack: U of W U of W dropped ball on cybersecurity: staffer U of W says student, faculty info stolen in cyberattack U of W to undergo campus-wide reboot; forensic analysis into cyberattack promised U of W reschedules exams to mid-April following cyber attack U of W delays exams as it calms down staff, faculty in wake of cyber attack U of W paralyzed by cyber incident Advertisement Advertise With Us\nHistory Updated on Thursday, December 19, 2024 11:33 AM CST: Corrects typo in headline\nUpdated on Thursday, December 19, 2024 12:00 PM CST: Revises lede\nTweet Share Print Email Read Later Report Error Submit a Tip",

    "title": "What David Moyes did to Declan Rice at full-time of Arsenal's crushing West Ham defeat - football.london",
    "text": "[Arsenal](https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/) endured a tough evening on Thursday, losing 2-0 to West Ham United at the Emirates Stadium. The north Londoners had the chance to go to the top of the Premier League table if they were able to secure all three points. But Tomas Soucek broke the deadlock early on before Konstantinos Mavropanos doubled his side's lead in the second half. Mikel Arteta's side were unable to find an answer, losing their first match at home this season. After the full-time whistle, Gunners midfielder Declan Rice was spotted embracing Hammers boss David Moyes, with the two sharing a few words as they hugged. Of course, Rice was managed by Moyes during his time with West Ham, signing for Arsenal in the most recent summer transfer window, joining for a club-record £105million. The result means that the Gunners are still two points behind league leaders Liverpool, who beat Burnley 2-0 earlier in the week. Meanwhile, Aston Villa are just three points off the top whilst fourth-placed Manchester City are five behind the Reds, also having a game in hand on their title rivals.

    "text": "Former President Donald Trump’s campaign has come under fire following a controversial post on Tuesday. The post featured two contrasting images accompanied by the message, “Import the third world. Become the third world.”\nOn the left, the image titled “Your neighborhood under Trump” depicts a pristine neighborhood with an American flag displayed, notably devoid of people. Conversely, the right image, labeled “Your neighborhood under Kamala,” showcases a cropped version of a Getty Images photo featuring migrants gathered outside the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City from August 2023.\nThe photo predominantly highlights individuals of color, with the Getty Images caption identifying them as recent migrants seeking temporary housing. Many critics have responded to the post by accusing the Trump campaign of perpetuating racial hostility and fostering anti-immigrant sentiments.\nThe NAACP weighed in on the matter via their social media account, stating, “Don’t just take our word for it. They are showing all of us just how racist they are. This is what’s on the ballot this November.”\nBill Burton, a former deputy press secretary under President Barack Obama, added, “Well, didn’t take too long for the Trump campaign to get to the openly racist part of their effort.”\nIn defense of the post, the Trump campaign argued that it highlights the difference between Trump’s and Vice President Kamala Harris’ immigration policies. Karoline Leavitt, the campaign’s national press secretary, stated, “President Trump puts Americans first and secured our border. Kamala Harris has opened our border to millions of illegal immigrants from all over the world and has forced struggling taxpayers to pay for their free entry into the country.”\nAdditionally, former Trump campaign adviser Bryan Lanza defended the post during a CNN interview, claiming that race was not a factor and that Republicans do not view people through the lens of skin color. Republican commentator Tricia McLaughlin supported Lanza’s stance, asserting that the image depicts chaos rather than racism.\nThroughout his campaign, Trump has often utilized disparaging rhetoric regarding undocumented immigrants, labeling them as criminals and insinuating negative traits. He has referred to them with racially charged language, characterizing them as “animals” or “poisoning the blood of our country.”\nThe Trump campaign has previously employed similar imagery and language in campaign advertisements, accusing Vice President Harris of prioritizing “illegals” over American citizens. They highlight various incidents involving migrant crime, promoting their “America-first agenda” and pledging mass deportation on the first day of Trump’s potential second presidency.\nInterestingly, Trump continues to assert that Harris was designated as “border czar,” a role she never officially held. Instead, her responsibilities involved leading diplomatic initiatives aimed at addressing the underlying causes of migration from Central America, particularly in nations such as El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Biden had previously undertaken a similar role during his time as vice president.\nSenator JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, criticized Harris on social media, stating, “Kamala Harris has pursued a policy of allowing large numbers of unvetted migrants into our country. It has led to predictable and extremely tragic results.”\nIn a conversation with Elon Musk on Monday, Trump claimed that the migrant crisis had “overwhelmed” New York City. He repeatedly asserted sweeping generalizations about undocumented immigrants, describing them as “non-productive” individuals, despite Musk’s insistence that they are likely “good, hard-working people.”\nThe Republican National Convention last month also saw Trump emphasizing his rigid stance on immigration, with attendees displaying signs advocating for “Mass Deportations Now.”\nThe ongoing discourse surrounding immigration, intensified by Trump’s rhetoric and campaign strategies, continues to attract significant attention as the 2024 election approaches.\nSource: ABC News",
