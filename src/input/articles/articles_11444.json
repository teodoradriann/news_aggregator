    "title": "Republican budget would tax remittances to families abroad - Baptist News Global",
    "text": "Foreign nationals working in the U.S. will have to pay a 5% excise tax on money they send family in other countries if Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill” becomes law.\nKnown as remittance transfers, the transactions are a crucial way immigrants and other non-American citizens working legally in the U.S. help their families and, in turn, the economies in their home nations.\n“For many countries, money transfers from citizens working abroad are a lifeline for development,” according to the International Monetary Fund. “They have been growing rapidly in the past few years and now represent the largest source of foreign income for many developing countries.”\n“For many countries, money transfers from citizens working abroad are a lifeline for development.”\nThe U.S. leads the world in remittance transfers. In 2022, an estimated $79 million was sent to friends and families in other countries, Americans for Financial Reform reported.\nThe language of the budget plan passed by the House in May and currently before the Senate requires remittance transfer providers to collect the tax and send it to the U.S. Treasury Department. U.S. citizens sending remittances would have to verify citizenship to avoid the tax.\nA study by the Tax Foundation concluded the tax will create more headaches than revenues with requirements for extra ID-verification and reporting on Americans and U.S. financial institutions.\n“The tax will be hard to enforce. Cash hand-offs, cryptocurrency wallets, and informal value-transfer networks sit outside the statutory net, so the rule will divert flows to opaque channels rather than capture meaningful revenue,” the report said.\nAnd using tax policy in an attempt to reduce immigration will only hurt the U.S. economy, the Tax Foundation found. “Perhaps an even more harmful consequence of the excise tax will be its dissuasion of foreign investment into the country. It makes it more difficult for foreigners to use U.S. banks, even for purposes unrelated to immigration or remittance.”\nIn many low- and middle-income nations, remittances have surpassed foreign direct investments in creating economic growth and reducing poverty, according to the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.\n“Perhaps an even more harmful consequence of the excise tax will be its dissuasion of foreign investment into the country.”\n“When remittances are used to purchase goods and services, this increased consumption has a positive impact on aggregate demand and generates economic growth. And when used to invest in human capital (e.g., in education), remittances can contribute to economic development in the medium and long terms,” the Baker Institute said.\nThe tax would add insult to injury for non-citizens already facing growing transaction fees on remittances, according to Americans for Financial Reform. “In the last three years, some of the most financially vulnerable people in the United States, mostly lower-income immigrant workers, lost $15.4 billion in hidden exchange rate markups — about 20% of the value of total transfers — when they sent money home to support their families.”\nThe proposed excise tax on remittances is little more than a shakedown of people already struggling financially, said Guerline Jozef, executive director of Haitian Bridge Alliance. “This is not sound policy — it is legalized extortion targeting Black, brown and immigrant families who have already sacrificed so much to sustain both their adopted countries and their nations of origin.”\nAccording to the alliance, remittances account for 20% of the GDP in Haiti, 26% in El Salvador and 28% in Honduras. The Philippines received $40 billion in remittances in 2023 while Nigeria received $20 billion.\n“The overwhelming majority of remittance senders are not wealthy elites but working-class immigrants who hold multiple jobs, pay U.S. taxes, contribute to Social Security, and still carry the responsibility of supporting loved ones back home,” the organization added.\nRelated articles:\nIn a year of voucher mania, a controversial federal plan emerges\nFaith leaders decry ‘big beautiful bill’ as immoral and un-Christian\nRepublicans want to tax university endowments that provide scholarships",

    "text": "“We did it. WE DID IIIIIIIIT!” Winning his first ever title back in June, these were one of the first words that came out of Jayson Tatum’s mouth. But for Boston fans and the rest of the world, it seemed like they had seen this movie before. Where? You ask. Well, 16 years ago when Kevin Garnett led the team in green to the title and yelled, “Anything’s possible. ANYTHING’S POSIBLEEE!” Sure enough, that marked the beginning of JT’s “Plagiarism World Tour” as the hits just kept on coming.\nAnd Tatum has become the talk of the town once again after the NBA World began mocking him for another act of plagiarism. Yes, starring in the cover of Sports Illustrated, the Celtics superstar can be seen in a crisp black and white suit, holding a glass of champagne, raising a toast for his recent win. However, the picture is eerily similar to the iconic Leonardo DiCaprio meme from the 2013 film ‘The Great Gatsby’ where the Hollywood star poses in a similar fashion. And the similarity caught the fans attention as one wrote, “Jayson Tatum not beating the allegations.”\nJayson Tatum not beating the allegations\n[pic.twitter.com/TDTNW5Llyl]\n— Mink Flow (@currypistonn)\n[July 25, 2024]\n(Developing Story)",

    "text": "Hamzah Sheeraz appears destined to go right to the top, and his plan to match Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury's stardom is clear. The rising middleweight star is undefeated, earning huge plaudits on UK shores and already growing into a major player in the sport under promoter Frank Warren . Sheeraz has fought on some huge occasions in his career so far, including the Queensberry vs Matchroom 5 vs 5 in June, and is starting to generate the hype of a superstar in the making. He will next take on a domestic clash against Tyler Denny under the bright lights in front of 96,000 people at Wembley Stadium on the Anthony Joshua vs Daniel Dubois undercard . And the 25-year-old carries an aura of supreme confidence that he can become a leading figurehead of British boxing alongside heavyweights Joshua and Fury. Read More In Boxing \"I definitely want to be the face of British boxing with AJ and Fury,\" he told talkSPORT.com. \"I'd be a fool to think otherwise. You can only dream big and everything I have dreamed of is becoming reality. \"I have already started fulfilling dreams by continuing to work hard and show dedication, so I need to keep that up. \"And like I said with my team, if I listen to them and I'm sure within the next two years or so I can be up there.\" Most read in Boxing Joshua and Fury have become the most prominent figures in a bright age for domestic boxing talent, both selling out Wembley Stadium for huge fights. The pair are both at the peak of their powers and are firmly in the world title mix alongside Oleksandr Usyk . Sheeraz has high hopes of reaching world level in the imminent future, which will help him grow his name further in line with his mercurial talent. His promoter Warren has heavily backed him to reach the pinnacle of the sweet science, and Sheeraz has also linked up with Saudi boxing chief HE Turki Alalshikh as a Riyadh Season Ambassador to lead the revolution. Some huge fights are being made domestically on UK shores across the globe, with a host of big names campaigning including Chris Eubank Jr. Sheeraz is also 6ft 3ins, a towering operator, who will easily be capable of switching to heavier divisions for success including 168lbs where Canelo Alvarez has dominated for so long. The British talent has spoken fondly of fighting at a time when opportunities are becoming bigger and better for boxers to reach new heights. He continued: \"It's the best time to be in boxing. \"Having the Saudis involved, they have brought boxing back to how it used to be in the 80's. \"The best are fighting the best and them fighting four or five times a year. When someone comes along and changes the game like that, you can only be thankful. \"I suppose the only way I can thank these guys is by carrying on putting on these devastating performances at every opportunity I get.\" For now focus will switch for Sheeraz to making another statement against Denny. A win for Sheeraz, straight after dispatching of prospect Ammo Williams in such dominant fashion, could see the star awarded a world title shot. And he believes it won't be long until he knocks on the door too heavily for other contenders and champions to ignore. He concluded: \"This fight against Denny is giving me a buzz but any fight does at this stage. \"I prepare for him like I would any opponent, but I look at it as any day in the office as I progress forwad. Read More on talkSPORT \"But this one feels massively important for me given the amount of people, but I need to carry on winning. \"But god willing I will become one of the biggest names in boxing, I just need to take one step at a time, beat Denny and keep listening to those advising me.\" talkSPORT will bring you exclusive live commentary of the heavyweight clash at Wembley Stadium between Anthony Joshua and Daniel Dubois on Saturday, September 21.

This year's potato yield totals are even higher in the province, according to the Potato Growers of Alberta. (Kirsten Murphy/CBC - image credit)\nPotato farmers in the province enjoyed a strong harvest in 2023, after back-to-back, record-breaking production years, according to the Potato Growers of Alberta.\nThis year, Alberta produced 32,063,000 hundredweight (CWT) potatoes, more than Prince Edward Island's 25,813,000 CWT total, per StatsCanada.\nLast year marked just the second time this century that Alberta surpassed P.E.I., famous for its spuds, as Canada's largest potato-producing province.\n\"The industry is starting to shift, and it's not just Alberta,\" said Terence Hochstein, executive director of the Potato Growers of Alberta.\n\"Manitoba is growing. Washington is growing. Idaho continues to grow. The production is starting to shift from the east to the west.\"\nRows of potato plants at an Alberta farm in 2022. Rows of potato plants at an Alberta farm. (Potato Growers of Alberta)\nHochstein said higher yield numbers in western North America are largely because of increased planting, not consistently strong growing conditions.\nGrowers planted 80,100 acres of potatoes in Alberta this year, up from last year's total of 73,080 acres.\n\"We went into a very good warm May and June. … And that just seemed to translate into a great crop this year,\" he said, adding that timely rains helped potato farmers in central and northern Alberta.\n\"Last few years [growers] ran out of moisture.\"\nFarmers face drought conditions\nMost of Alberta's agricultural areas are running moisture deficits extending back at least three years, according to the province.\nAlberta's final crop report of 2023 shows major crops were down 4.3 per cent from the five-year average.\nMost potato acres in Alberta are grown under irrigation, and even though some irrigators had their allocations reduced this summer, access to reservoirs has helped shield potato production from drought impacts.\nAlison Davie, owner of North Paddock Farms in Taber, Alta., said her yield was \"above average,\" despite hot, dry conditions.\nStory continues \"We're mostly in the St. Mary River Irrigation District. … We had our water cut back quite a lot,\" she said.\n\"You just have to roll with it, and whatever Mother Nature deals us, you just have to make the best of it.\"\nAlison Davie, who owns North Paddock Farms in Taber, Alta. said her potato harvest went \"pretty well,\" despite hot temperatures at her farm. Alison Davie, who owns North Paddock Farms in Taber, Alta. said her potato harvest went \"pretty well,\" despite hot temperatures at her farm. (Submitted by Alison Davie)\nDavie, who sits on the board of the Potato Growers of Alberta, said she had to harvest early in the morning during the early part of the season to avoid digging up potatoes in the heat of the afternoon, which creates storage issues.\nShe's glad to be tending tubers in the province.\n\"There's a lot of young people involved, and we can see the growth potential,\" she said. \"It's definitely a very exciting industry, and that's why the investment is coming this way.\"\nMore growth projected\nHochstein believes Alberta's potato industry will continue to grow.\n\"The opportunities, … the access to labour, the willingness to work with local and provincial governments, everything just seems to be lined up right,\" he said.\nMcCain Foods announced in March it would invest $600 million to more than double the size of its french fry processing facility, just outside Coaldale, Alta., and the workforce employed there.\nPotato production contributes more than $2 billion per year to Alberta's economy, according to the Potato Growers of Alberta.\nTRENDING 1.

    "text": "USA TODAY Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II Saleen Martin, USA TODAY January 19, 2024 at 3:37 PM · 4 min read Link Copied Read full article\nDuring World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle.\nThe Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\"\nTwo of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France.\nHis Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back.\nAva Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings.\nOn Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war.\nA Bible belonging to the late Edsel J. McKnight. During WWII, the Bibles were given to servicemen to protect their hearts during battle. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales.\n“It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.”\nCoogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums.\n“The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.”\nLt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled.\nA Bible belonging to the late Edsel J. McKnight. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said.\nShe noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out.\nOnce they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away.\nAlthough there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called.\n“I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.”\nLieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan called the number written in the note, she spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. They organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the family, who is from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York.\nLt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, online records show.\nLt. Edsel J. McKnight, who served in the United States Army Air Forces. He was killed in spring 1944. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life.\n“He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said.\nOnce Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost.\nPictured in the back row, fifth, sixth and seventh from the left are brothers Ray, Edsel and Earl McKnight. The brothers each served in World War II. Ray and Earl survived but Edsel did not. Ray, Edsel and Earl McKnight. The brothers all served in World War II. Ray and Earl survived but Edsel did not. He was killed in spring 1944 when his aircraft was shot down in France.\n“He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.”\nIt ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said.\n“That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.\nLt. Edsel J. McKnight, who died in spring 1944 while serving in the United States Army Air Forces.\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: 'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family\nView comments",
