    "title": "Tesla's Giga Berlin Expansion Gets Environmental Authority Approval After Chancellor Scholz Voiced Aim For Brandenburg To Become European Hub For Elon Musk's Company - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) - Benzinga",
    "text": " Tesla Inc’s TSLA expansion plans for its gigafactory in Germany have reportedly received approval from environmental authorities.\nWhat Happened : The environmental authorities in the German state of Brandenburg, where Tesla’s gigafactory is located, have given the green light to the company’s expansion plans, Reuters reported.\nThe approval allows Tesla to create an asphalted logistics area for new vehicles, stairwells on its pressing plant, and an access guard, the report said.\nThe approval is key to the EV giant’s aim of doubling the plant's capacity for battery production to 100 gigawatt hours and car production to 1 million units annually.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz came out in support of Tesla’s Berlin gigafactory expansion earlier amid protests by environmentalists and local residents. He expressed his desire for Tesla to develop in Brandenburg in the same way Ford did in Cologne.\nWhy It Matters: Environmentalists and locals have voiced against the proposed expansion. In May, several protestors attempted to storm the company's factory and even injured several police officers in the ensuing clash. Several protestors were taken into police custody over the incident .\nIn March, an arson attack on the factory caused a power outage and halted production for about a week. Far-left activist organization Vulkan Group claimed the attack and said it was spurred by environmental concerns.\nAs per Tesla’s first quarter report, the German factory currently has an installed annual vehicle capacity of 375,000 Model Y vehicles in addition to millions of battery cells.\nCheck out more of Benzinga's Future Of Mobility coverage by following this link .\nRead More:\nPalantir Chair Peter Thiel Praises Elon Musk’s Risk-Taking Ability, Regrets Not Investing In Tesla: ‘There’s Something About Risk He Knows That We Don’t’ Disclaimer : This content was partially produced with the help of Benzinga Neuro and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\nPhoto courtesy: Tesla\n ",

    "text": "The popular image of an idyllic December is one of white Christmases, hot chocolate retreats, snow-capped conifers, and cozy, cold-weather activities. But not every December lives up to those expectations. Most of the continental U.S. will experience its peak winter cold weather in January and February . Officially, winter doesn't even start until Dec. 21. Across the U.S., the average December temperature from 1901-2000 was right above freezing point, at 32.68 F. Yearly temperatures can be compared to this 20th-century long-term average to find how uncommon a year's December climate was. The nation's warmest December on record was 2021, when the average temperature reached 6.66 F above the long-term average, at 39.34 F. December 2022 was closer to the previous century's average for the U.S. overall, at 33.08 F. The average temperature in Hall County, Georgia from 1901-2000 was 42.3. The diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F. However, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer. When did Hall County, Georgia experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average. Read on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Hall County, Georgia history.",

El evento consistió en el izado de la Bandera Nacional en la renovada Plaza Mayor, donde resonaron los acordes del himno nacional. Los integrantes de la Agrupación motorista V-CAE, en el marco del III Encuentro Nacional de la asociación, tomaron la responsabilidad de izar la Bandera Española junto con el primer edil, David Esteban, quien posteriormente se dirigió a los presentes con unas palabras de homenaje y agradecimiento. \"Estoy orgulloso de representar a un municipio que sabe rendir homenaje a sus símbolos y a quienes perdieron su vida por lo que esos símbolos representan\", expresó. También mostró su gratitud hacia la agrupación motorista de los Cuerpos Armados Españoles por haber seleccionado Medina de Rioseco para \"rendir homenaje a las víctimas del terrorismo y celebrar aquí el III encuentro nacional de su agrupación\". Tras el izado de la bandera en la Plaza Mayor, los participantes se trasladaron a la Plaza de la Paz, donde se erige el monolito en homenaje a las Víctimas del Terrorismo, inaugurado en 2011. Allí, guardaron un minuto de silencio y se ofició un responso a cargo del párroco de Santa María y Santiago, don Alberto Rodríguez Cillero.",

    "text": "Moses Lake Christian Academy sends graduates forth with prayers, blessings\nMOSES LAKE — The Moses Lake Christian Academy marked a significant milestone May 31 as the Class of 2025 celebrated its graduation ceremony, featuring seven accomplished students.\nThe event, held at the academy’s auditorium, was attended by parents, faculty and friends, all coming together to celebrate the hard work and dedication of these young graduates.\nThe ceremony opened with a heartfelt message from Valedictorian Brandon Swinger, who reflected on the trials and tribulations that shaped their high school experience.\n“Life is hard, so every day I pray that God makes me harder,” he quoted the class motto, emphasizing resilience and the importance of faith amidst challenges.\nHe further encouraged his peers to embrace their potential.\n“You can either be the civilian or you can be the hero who sacrifices everything to credit those around him,” he said.\nSwinger shared anecdotes about popular heroes like Peter Parker, drawing parallels between their struggles and the challenges faced by students in their academic journeys.\n“Be like Peter, do the things you’re afraid to do,” he urged, inspiring his classmates to pursue their aspirations boldly.\nFollowing Swinger’s address, Tyler Tadema, the senior class advisor, offered blessings and reflections on each graduate’s character.\n“Jennika, you are a woman of grace. I bless you. God is able to make all grace abound to you,” he said, acknowledging the unique contributions of each student to the academy community.\nHis sentiments were echoed throughout the event, with every graduate receiving personal words of encouragement.\nIn his speech, Kayden Edwards highlighted the importance of continuous growth beyond graduation.\n“The road ahead is uncertain. We might feel overwhelmed, but we can lean on that promise for most of our lives,” he said, referencing Matthew 28:20, which reassures believers of Christ’s constant presence.\nThe keynote address featured Mark Bassett, who underscored the values integral to the academy’s mission.\n“Your journey is just beginning, and the questions you face are significant. Seek to be a shepherd, a servant, and to understand suffering in your path,” he said.\nThe ceremony concluded with the formal awarding of diplomas, marking not just an end but the beginning of a new chapter for the Class of 2025.\n“Congratulations, Class of 2025,” the administration announced as the graduates turned their tassels from right to left.",
