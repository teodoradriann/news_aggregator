    "text": "WASHINGTON — The number of homeless veterans jumped by more than 7.4% in 2023, according to a report released last December by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Researchers found that in one single night in January of that year, there were more than 35,000 veterans without a home. And as bad as that sounds, things may actually be worse. \"VA's data shows that nearly 300,000 veterans engaged in its homeless programs during 2023,\" said Rep. Mike Levin (D-California) during a hearing Wednesday of the House Veterans Affairs Economic Opportunity Subcommittee. The chairman of the panel demanded answers. \"Why is it that we're spending over $3.1 billion at the VA to address homelessness among our veterans this year which shakes out to about $90,000 per veteran, but the number of veterans is increasing?\" asked Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wisconsin). Van Orden continued: \"We are doing something wrong. We just are. This subcommittee needs a better picture from the VA about the actual issues veterans and providers are dealing with so we can be proactive.\" The Department of Veterans Affairs said it is making \"significant progress,\" but acknowledged \"the job is not done.\" \"Every veteran should have access to permanent housing with the supports needed to afford them dignity and allow them to achieve their potential. And we will push ourselves as long as there are veterans in need,\" said Dr., Thomas O'Toole Deputy Undersecretary/Veterans Health Administration. In 2022, the Veterans Affairs Department announced that Virginia, along with Connecticut and Delaware, had \"effectively ended\" veteran homelessness.",

    "text": "[Pakistan](/pakistan) [Print 2023-12-29](/print/2023-12-29) [Privilege motion against CAA director general: Senate body seeks detailed report within 15 days ](https://www.brecorder.com/news/40281009/privilege-motion-against-caa-director-general-senate-body-seeks-detailed-report-within-15-days) ISLAMABAD: The Senate Committee on Rules of Procedure and Privileges granted 15 days time to Aviation to submit a detailed report with a way forward in a privilege motion against the director general of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Chaired by Senator Muhammad Tahir Bizinjo, the committee met here on Thursday. The committee addressed a privilege motion filed by senators, Saleem Mandviwalla, Faisal Saleem Rehman, and Syed Sabir Shah against the director general of CAA. The motion was based on alleged false assurances by the director general of CAA to the sub-committee of the Senate Standing Committee on Aviation on the issue of cancellation of licenses of PIA pilots. The Adviser to the PM on Aviation, Secretary Aviation and the DG of CAA briefed the committee that as per existing rules of CAA, once a license is cancelled it is cancelled for life and in order to restore the cancelled licenses, rules amendment is required which is the domain of Cabinet. The mover was of the view that this whole issue had been created with mala fide of CAA who misled the then minister which resulted in his statement in Parliament and this issue was created which has damaged the career of pilots as well as the image of the PIA. The movers demanded that action may be recommended against the director general of CAA. The adviser and secretary Aviation requested to grant 60 days time to initiate rule amendment process in line with international practices. The committee members unanimously granted 15 days time to submit a detailed report with a way forward. The committee also discussed the privilege motion based on a malicious report aired by a TV channel against senators, Mehar Taj, Rubina Khalid, and Dr Zarqa. The bureau chief of the channel submitted an unconditional apology and assured that a rebuttal will be aired in the same manner. The committee directed to issue a rebuttal and share clipping with the committee. The motion was disposed of accordingly. The meeting was attended by senators, Professor Sajid Mir, Irfanul Haque Siddiqui, Syed Ali Zafar, Saleem Mandiwalla, Dr Mehar Taj Roghani, Dr Humayun Khan Mohmand, and Syed Muhammad Sabir Shah. Caretaker Minister for Information, Broadcasting, and Parliamentary Affairs Murtaza Solangi, along with other senior officials from attached departments, were also present.

    "text": "iPhone users report battery drain issues after iOS 18.1.1 update\nPhoto: Shutterstock\niPhone users who recently downloaded Apple's latest iOS 18.1.1 update are reporting significant battery life issues, with many claiming the update is 'ruining' their device's performance.\nReleased this week, iOS 18.1.1 contains \"important security fixes,\" prompting a rush to update. However, some users are now expressing regret, referring to rapid battery drain after installing the update,[News.Az](https://news.az)reports, citing\n[Daily Mail.](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14113969/iPhone-Apple-iOS-18-update-RUINING-battery-life.html)\nTaking to X, one vented: 'WTF is wrong with the latest iOS update?! My phone is dying every 7-8hrs despite being fully charged!'\nAnother added: 'ios 18.1.1 battery drained 2x faster than 18.'\nAnd one tweeted: 'Even with iOS 18.1.1, the battery drain issue has not been fixed.'\nHave you downloaded iOS 18.1.1 and noticed your iPhone's battery draining?\nHere's what experts say you should do.\nApple released iOS 18.1.1 this week, and says it fixes two vulnerabilities which have already been 'actively exploited' by hackers.\nAccording to security experts, these bugs could be used to remotely compromise a user's device and even gain access to their online accounts.\nWhile the security weaknesses have only been exploited on Mac so far, waiting too long could leave your iPhone vulnerable to being hacked.\nFollowing its release, several iPhone users quickly downloaded the update, and noticed their battery draining.\n'Till yesterday I was getting a good 17-18hrs of battery on one charge. How do I roll back 18.1.1?' one user tweeted.\nAnother wrote: 'On an iPhone SE2, the battery drains from 100% to 66% in 8.5 hours (with the screen locked).'\nIf you've noticed your battery draining, don't panic - it is actually normal to experience battery drain in the aftermath of a power-intensive update.\nSometimes it can take hours and even days for software changes to finalise, which means that battery health can fluctuate in the meantime.\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n'Installing a new OS on an iPhone triggers a lot of stuff to go on in the background, from indexing to recalibrating the battery, and this can go on for hours or even days,' Adrian Kingsley-Hughes, a researcher at ZDNet, previously explained.\n'Not only does this consume power, but the battery recalibration can give the impression that the battery is draining more rapidly when in fact it isn't.'\nHowever, if issues last for longer, it may be a good idea to check your phone battery's maximum capacity.\nAn iPhone's capacity to hold charge lowers as the battery chemically ages, which may result in fewer hours of usage and worse performance between charges.\nThe maximum capacity is located in the Battery tab found within the Settings menu on an iPhone's home page.\nIf your battery needs replacing, an 'important battery message' will pop up indicating that its health has significantly degraded.\nUsers should also check if Wi-Fi Assist setting is switched on, which keeps devices connected to the inert when the Wi-Fi connection is poor but can drain battery too.\nPhoto: Apple\nFinally, Apple advises that users can take a number of other steps to maximise their battery life.\nKeeping your device away from extreme temperatures higher than 35°C (95°F) is a must for preserving battery life.\nCertain phone cases should also be removed while charging a device if they generate excess heat, to avoid unexpected device shutdowns.\nFor those not phased by the battery issues, iPhone users can downloaded iOS 18.1.1 by going to Settings, clicking General and then Software Updates to follow the on-screen instructions.",

    "text": "[i24NEWS](/fr)[International](/fr/actu/international)- Macron met en garde contre une escalade au Liban et critique la position d'Israël Macron met en garde contre une escalade au Liban et critique la position d'Israël Le président français a également exprimé sa profonde préoccupation quant au nombre \"absolument choquant\" de victimes civiles causées par les frappes israéliennes au Liban. Le président français Emmanuel Macron a lancé un avertissement concernant la situation au Liban, lors d'une conférence de presse conjointe avec le Premier ministre canadien Justin Trudeau à Montréal. \"La France s'oppose à ce que le Liban devienne un nouveau Gaza\", a déclaré Macron, appelant à la fois Israël et le Hezbollah à cesser les hostilités. Le président français a souligné l'urgence d'arrêter l'escalade, exhortant Israël à mettre fin à ses frappes et le Hezbollah à cesser ses tirs de roquettes. Macron a également exprimé sa profonde préoccupation quant au nombre \"absolument choquant\" de victimes civiles causées par les frappes israéliennes au Liban. Cette déclaration marque une critique directe des actions militaires d'Israël dans la région. Le président français a particulièrement visé le Premier ministre israélien Benjamin Netanyahou, qualifiant de potentielle \"faute\" tout refus d'un cessez-le-feu. \"La proposition de cessez-le-feu est solide. Elle n'a pas été faite en l'air\", a-t-il insisté, ajoutant que rejeter cette proposition pourrait entraîner une escalade régionale incontrôlable et de nouvelles victimes civiles au Liban. En amont de ces déclarations, Macron avait déjà exprimé sa position sur la plateforme X (anciennement Twitter), soulignant qu'il \"ne doit pas y avoir de guerre au Liban\" et appelant toutes les parties, y compris celles qui fournissent les moyens de combat, à cesser leurs actions. Ces interventions de Macron s'inscrivent dans un contexte de tensions croissantes entre Israël et le Hezbollah, avec des échanges de tirs qui menacent de déstabiliser davantage la région. La France, historiquement impliquée au Liban, cherche à jouer un rôle de médiateur pour éviter une escalade qui pourrait avoir des conséquences désastreuses pour le Liban et l'ensemble du Moyen-Orient.",

    "text": "Una violenza «inaudita», quella di cui è stato vittima un uomo a Marechiaro, piccolo borgo sul litorale Napoletano, appena fuori Posillipo, e denunciata dal deputato di Avs Francesco Emilio Borrelli sui social. «Mercoledì avevo deciso di andare con mia moglie e i miei figli a cena in un locale a Marechiaro», inizia il suo racconto l’uomo, originario di Caserta, «arrivati lì con l’auto mi si avvicina subito un parcheggiatore abusivo che mi fa parcheggiare all’interno di un’area privata delimitata da un cancello. Ad un certo punto, nel corso della serata, il parcheggiatore mi raggiunge al tavolo e mi chiede di portare via l’auto in quanto da lì a pochi minuti il cancello sarebbe stato chiuso». L’uomo lo segue nel parcheggio e a questo punto gli viene detto che il costo della sosta era diventato di 50 euro, non più di 5 come avevano concordato in precedenza. «Interviene mia moglie dicendogli che al massimo si poteva arrivare a 10. Lui non ci sta, la spintona e la schiaffeggia», prosegue la vittima del pestaggio, «io intervengo ma lui mi ha picchiato selvaggiamente e sono caduto battendo la testa sull’auto. Anche una volta riverso al suolo, il parcheggiatore ha continuato a colpirmi ferocemente a suon di calci in faccia». Lì vicino c’erano anche i figli della coppia. «Ora sto molto male, ma quel che mi fa più rabbia è che i miei tre bambini abbiamo dovuto assistere a questa violenza inaudita», dice l’uomo, che poi si sfoga: «Nonostante le urla nessuno ci ha soccorsi probabilmente per paura e connivenza con il soggetto criminale». Borrelli attacca poi l’aggressore: «Sono estorsori, molto spesso al soldo dei clan, e fanno ricorso alla violenza e a metodi camorristici per ottenere il pagamento del racket».
