    "text": "Chuvas e ventos fortes voltam a provocar estragos em Porto Alegre\nMais de 7 mil residências e comércios estão sem luz na capital gaúcha; fornecimento de água também está comprometido\nEduardo Pinzon\nO temporal que atingiu Porto Alegre, nesta quarta-feira (01), voltou a provocar enchentes e estragos na cidade. Além da chuva forte, ventos de 70 km/h atingiram as redes de energia elétrica, deixando 115 mil residências no escuro na região metropolitana da capital gaúcha. Até a tarde desta quinta-feira (02), mais de 7 mil casas e comércios permaneciam sem luz.\nTrês estações de tratamento e distribuição de água foram afetados, e o abastecimento já está comprometido. A falta de energia também atingiu o Sistema de Drenagem e Proteção de Cheias da capital gaúcha, e 5 estações de bombeamento de águas pluviais pararam de funcionar. Como consequência disso, regiões já castigadas pelas inundações de maio do ano passado voltaram a enfrentar alagamentos.\nO primeiro dia útil de ano também foi de transtornos para quem dependia do trem metropolitano de Porto Alegre. Com os trilhos tomados pelo lodo, duas estações tiveram que ser fechadas, e os passageiros precisaram fazer parte do trajeto de ônibus.\nPara os moradores, 2025 começou repetindo um pesadelo do ano passado. \"Eu sou de Canoas, eu perdi tudo na enchente. A gente ficou 40 dias de baixo d'água. Agora, parece que qualquer chuva vai acontecer tudo de novo\", afirma um passageiro.\nA circulação dos trens foi normalizada às 10 horas da manhã, mais de 18 horas depois do temporal. Em 24 horas, choveu quase 70% do esperado para todo o mês de janeiro.\nAs enchentes afetaram até mesmo a cerimônia de posse do prefeito reeleito Sebastião Melo (MDB-RS). O evento, que seria realizado no Centro Cultural da Usina do Gasômetro, precisou ser cancelado depois que o local foi invadido pela água.\n\"É aquilo que venho dizendo ao longo desse processo. Nós fizemos muito desse maio para cá, não o suficiente. Os alagamentos aconteciam antes da chuva de maio e acontecem depois, porque tu tem uma cidade que tem um déficit de macro e micro drenagem enorme ao da sua história. E que nós vamos enfrentar bem melhor agora com os financiamentos internacionais, com o PAC, nós assinamos no dia 31, e com dois impressos, R$ 300 milhões Caixa e Banco do Brasil\", indicou o prefeito.",

    "text": "As it continues its genocidal campaign in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, Israel is demonstrating its capacity to commit war crimes in Lebanon as well, writes Marjorie Cohn.\nStand With Lebanon vigil and rally outside the Lebanese embassy in Washington on Tuesday night. (Diane Krauthamer, Flickr, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0)\nBy Marjorie Cohn\nTruthout\nT he Israeli bombing of a residential neighborhood in Beirut is also a war crime.\nIsrael escalated attacks against Lebanon on Sept. 23, marking the deadliest day of Israeli bombings in that country since 2006. Israel’s strikes in southern and eastern Lebanon, as well as the capital city of Beirut, left a death toll of at least 274, including women, children and paramedics. [The toll on Tuesday was reportedly more than 550 people .]\nThe Israeli military targeted “medical centres, ambulances and cars of people trying to flee ,” according to Al Jazeera , which cited Lebanon’s Health Minister Firass Abiad as the source for the information. Israel also targeted civilian homes, which it claimed were housing Hezbollah weapons.\nThis latest targeting of Lebanese civilians comes on the heels of Israel’s detonation of hand-held electronic devices in civilian areas of Lebanon on Sept. 17 and 18, when Israeli forces remotely triggered multiple explosions of electronic pagers and walkie-talkies that killed at least 37 people, including a 9-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy, and maimed or injured 3,250 people, 200 critically.\nAbout 500 people suffered severe eye wounds and others received grave injuries to their hands, faces and bodies. The blasts occurred in residential buildings, barber shops, grocery stores, cars and at funerals. Many civilians, including government and hospital workers, were killed.\n\"This is premeditated\"\nLebanon's Health Minister, Dr Firass Abiad, believes Israel are targeting healthcare vehicles, as reports suggest 19 Ambulances and Fire Engines have been destroyed in their bombardment against Hezbollah, which he adds would be a war crime. #GNT pic.twitter.com/FOjf0IUzij\n— Al Arabiya English (@AlArabiya_Eng) September 25, 2024\nElias Warrak, an ophthalmologist at Mount Lebanon University Hospital in Beirut, treated several of those injured by the blasts. He told the BBC that between 60 percent and 70 percent of the patients he attended had to have at least one eye removed.\n“Some of the patients, we had to remove both eyes. It kills me. In my past 25 years in practice, I’ve never removed as many eyes as I did yesterday [Sept.17].”\nIsrael’s weaponization of 3,000 to 4,000 pagers and walkie-talkies programmed to explode simultaneously constituted “terrifying” violations of international law, according to 22 independent United Nations experts , including 13 special rapporteurs.\nThe radios and pagers were reportedly distributed to people associated with Hezbollah, which includes both military and civilian individuals. “At the time of the attacks there was no way of knowing who possessed each device and who was nearby,” the experts noted.\n“Simultaneous attacks by thousands of devices would inevitably violate humanitarian law, by failing to verify each target, and distinguish between protected civilians and those who could potentially be attacked for taking a direct part in hostilities.”\nA booby-trap is defined as something designed to kill or injure unexpectedly when a person performs an apparently safe act like answering a pager. International humanitarian law prohibits the use of booby-traps that are disguised as harmless objects when they are constructed and designed with explosives. They breach the principles of distinction , proportionality and precautions.\nRange of War Crimes\n“These attacks violate the human right to life, absent any indication that the victims posed an imminent lethal threat to anyone else at the time,” the U.N. experts wrote. “Such attacks could constitute war crimes of murder, attacking civilians, and launching indiscriminate attacks.”\nThe U.N. experts declared, “It is also a war crime to commit violence intended to spread terror among civilians, including to intimidate or deter them from supporting an adversary,” adding, “A climate of fear now pervades everyday life in Lebanon.”\nAmal Saad, an expert on Hezbollah, told Drop Site News ,\n“Everyone’s scared to send text messages, to make calls, and they’re afraid to open laptops. It’s definitely led to some level of complete disorientation, fear, confusion, paranoia. It has huge psychological effects.”\nSaad noted that the purpose behind the explosions “was to terrorize and paralyze and demoralize.”\nEx CIA Chief Leon Panetta says Lebanon pager explosions are terrorism, “This is going right into the supply chain,” he added. “And when you have terror going into the supply chain, it makes people ask the question: ‘What the hell is next?’” https://t.co/KocQoXzX6s\n— Iftikhar Firdous (@IftikharFirdous) September 23, 2024\nVolker Türk, U.N. high commissioner for human rights, likewise denounced the attacks in a statement , calling them “shocking, and their impact on civilians unacceptable,” and saying that “the fear and terror unleashed” was “profound.”\nTürk wrote,\n“Simultaneous targeting of thousands of individuals, whether civilians or members of armed groups, without knowledge as to who was in possession of the targeted devices, their location and their surroundings at the time of the attack, violates international human rights law and, to the extent applicable, international humanitarian law.”\nTürk addressing the General Assembly in December 2023. (UN Photo/Eskinder Debebe)\nThe independent U.N. experts urged states to bring to justice those who ordered and executed the attacks, under the well-established doctrine of universal jurisdiction.\nBut the weaponized electronic devices weren’t the only recent war crimes Israel has committed against Lebanon.\nBombing Residential Neighborhood in Beirut\nOn Sept. 20, an Israeli airstrike on an apartment building in a residential Beirut suburb killed a top Hezbollah leader along with at least 37 Lebanese people, including three children and seven women, and injured at least 68. This constituted a war crime as it was an intentional attack with knowledge it would cause incidental loss of life or injury to civilians and was clearly excessive in relation to the military advantage Israel sought.\nU.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan celebrated the attack , calling it “justice .”\nMohamad Elmasry, professor in the media studies program at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, described Sullivan’s statement as “shocking.” Elmasry told Al Jazeera,\n“The United States has a long history of its war crimes and it has been covering for Israeli crimes not only during the past 11.5 months [in Gaza] but for decades now — giving Israel cover at the UN and in other diplomatic circles and supplying Israel with weapons to target civilians.”\nUS Secretary of State Blinken has just endorsed the Israeli terrorist pager attack on Lebanon that maimed thousands.\nNBC: Some \"say it's a form of terrorism and it went too far.\"\nBlinken: \"It's very legitimate that Israel do something about Hezbollah.\" pic.twitter.com/HXMnK2ZFjg\n— Andre Damon (WSWS) (@Andre__Damon) September 25, 2024\nIndeed, the U.S. routinely vetoes U.N. Security Council resolutions condemning Israel for its war crimes in the occupied Palestinian territory and has pressured countries in the U.N. General Assembly to facilitate Israeli impunity.\nBut on Sept. 18, the General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted the State of Palestine’s resolution demanding an end to the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory in accordance with international law, as recently affirmed by the International Court of Justice.\nThe historic resolution calls for sanctioning Israel, that is, forbidding member states from doing business with Israel or promoting the legitimacy of Israel’s illegal occupation of Palestinian territory. The vote was 124 in favor and 14 against with 43 states abstaining and 12 states not voting.\nThe resolution reflects the opposition of the international community to Israel’s lawless behavior. It remains to be seen if and how the 124 states that voted for the resolution will implement it.\nSince Sept. 18, Israel has continued to commit war crimes in Lebanon. It has launched additional attacks on civilians, including the Sept. 20 bombings of an apartment building in Beirut, and the current targeting of civilian apartments, ambulances and medical centers, killing and wounding mounting numbers of civilians.\nIsraeli officials claimed that Hezbollah was storing thousands of long-range rockets in civilian homes. They sent people in Lebanon text messages and automated calls cautioning them to move away from Hezbollah’s weapons caches. But Lebanese civilians could not know how close they were to potential military targets, human rights groups said. UNIFIL , which is the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon, has “grave concern for the safety of civilians in southern Lebanon” amid what it called “the most intense Israeli bombing campaign” since Oct. 7.\nAs it continues its genocidal campaign in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, Israel is demonstrating that it is fully prepared to commit war crimes in Lebanon as well. In addition to their illegality, Israel’s actions imperil the entire region, and indeed, the world.\nMarjorie Cohn is professor emerita at Thomas Jefferson School of Law, dean of the People’s Academy of International Law and past president of the N ational Lawyers Guild.

    "text": "\nBelvedere College, Dublin\nTHE Provincial of the Jesuits in Ireland said this week that it was a “source of deep shame” that his order had failed to take action against a priest and teacher, now dead, who was the subject of 93 complaints of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse.\nThe Society of Jesus released a narrative report, Fr Joseph Marmion SJ: His abuse, the harm caused, and Jesuit accountability, earlier this month. It documents the complaints, from the 1940s and subsequent decades. Fr Marmion died in 2000.\nThe report sets out how the order responded to the allegations. It also names, for the first time, two other priests who were also the subject of numerous complaints of child sexual abuse, and who continued to work with children.\nOf the 93 complaints against Fr Marmion, 65 relate to his time teaching at Belvedere College, Dublin; 14 to Crescent College, Limerick; and 14 to Clongowes Wood College, Co. Kildare. Half were allegations of child sexual abuse.\nThe Provincial, Fr Shane Daly, said that it was a “source of deep shame” to discover that, when the allegations of abuse were first reported, the order had placed “the reputation of the order and the person accused” above the well-being of the complainants. “As was said before, things were done that should never have been done, and things that should have been done were not.”\nFr Marmion’s former pupils had been “horrifically abused”, he said. He paid tribute to them for their “courage and generosity” in coming forward. A redress scheme by the three Jesuit colleges concerned was announced in 2022.\nThe two other priests named are Fr Paul Andrews and Fr Dermot Casey, both directors of St Declan’s Special School and Child Guidance Centre in Dublin. Fr Casey died in 1997 and Fr Andrews in 2018.\n28 Apr 2023\n16 Jun 2023\n05 Jan 2024\n15 Dec 2023\n15 Sep 2023\n20 Sep 2023\n23 Feb 2024\n21 Feb 2024\n16 Feb 2024\nSneering at a new Live Aid show has political repercussions, argues Paul Vallely\nCalling for innovation!\nThe Bishop of Chichester is looking for an incumbent with the drive and pastoral heart to pursue the presence of Jesus within these rural villages.\nThe Bishop of Fulham seeks to appoint a Priest-in-Charge for the Benefice of St Alphage Hendon (Burnt Oak)\nWe are a vibrant all-age family who love Jesus and are characterised by our diversity in worship, from the traditional BCP Eucharist to more informal contemporary band led services.\nFind more jobs\n11 March 2024 | 6pm GMT\nAn expert panel discusses trust between the media and the public\nOnline Tickets available\n26 - 28 April 2024\nSee the full programme on the festival website.\nEarly bird tickets available\nClosing date: 30 June 2024\nRead more details about the awards\n ",
