Esta aeronave representa un gran salto tecnológico que equipara nuestras capacidades a las del resto de la región y significa también una gran oportunidad de transferencia de capacidades”.\nTras agradecer a los embajadores presentes de Estados Unidos, Marc Stanley, y de Noruega, Halvor Sætre por su “apoyo incondicional para la incorporación de este equipamiento”, el titular de la cartera destacó: “Nuestro compromiso es claro. Junto al Presidente Milei, vamos a saldar la deuda que el Estado arrastra hace décadas con las Fuerzas Armadas, para equiparlas, profesionalizarlas, adiestrarlas y, sobre todo, valorarlas por su servicio y su amor a la Patria”.\nDesde el 10 de diciembre, el Presidente @JMilei trabaja para hacer de nuestras Fuerzas Armadas un actor clave en esta nueva Argentina. Hoy lo demostramos al recibir la primera de las 4 aeronaves P-3 Orión, adquiridas a través de un convenio con Noruega.

    "title": "What are the cons of eating fish?",
    "text": "The Dark Side of the Dish: Understanding the Cons of Eating Fish While often touted as a health food, boasting omega-3 fatty acids and lean protein, consuming fish comes with its own set of potential downsides. The primary concerns revolve around environmental contaminants like mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and pesticide residues that accumulate in fish tissues. These substances can pose significant health risks, especially to vulnerable populations such as pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, and young children. Overfishing and unsustainable fishing practices are other major concerns, threatening marine ecosystems. The cost and availability of quality fish can also be drawbacks for some consumers.\nDiving Deeper: Unpacking the Negatives 1. Contaminant Accumulation: A Silent Threat Fish, particularly those higher up the food chain and longer-lived species, can accumulate toxins from their environment and diet. Mercury , a neurotoxin, is a major concern. High levels of mercury exposure can damage the nervous system in adults and disrupt brain development in fetuses and young children. PCBs , industrial chemicals once widely used, persist in the environment and can cause a range of health problems, including cancer, immune system suppression, and reproductive issues.\n2. Overfishing and Unsustainable Practices: Emptying the Oceans Overfishing is a critical problem, leading to the depletion of fish populations and disrupting marine ecosystems. Destructive fishing practices, such as bottom trawling, can damage habitats and kill non-target species. Choosing sustainably sourced fish is crucial to supporting healthy oceans.\n3. Aquaculture Concerns: A Mixed Bag While aquaculture (fish farming) can help alleviate pressure on wild fish stocks, it also presents its own set of challenges. Farmed fish can be raised in crowded conditions, increasing the risk of disease and the need for antibiotics. Some aquaculture practices can also pollute surrounding waters and damage coastal ecosystems. The Environmental Literacy Council offers valuable resources to understand the complexities of environmental issues, including sustainable fishing practices; read more at enviroliteracy.org .\n4. Cost and Accessibility: Not Always Affordable High-quality, sustainably sourced fish can be expensive, making it less accessible to some consumers. The price of fish can fluctuate depending on the season, location, and availability.\n5. Allergies and Sensitivities: A Real Consideration Fish allergies are relatively common, especially in children. Symptoms can range from mild skin reactions to severe anaphylaxis. Even without a true allergy, some people may experience sensitivities to certain types of fish.\n15 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about the Cons of Eating Fish 1. What are the main contaminants found in fish? The most concerning contaminants are mercury, PCBs, dioxins, and pesticide residues.\n2. How does mercury get into fish? Mercury is a naturally occurring element, but human activities like burning coal and mining release it into the environment. It enters waterways and is converted into methylmercury, a form that accumulates in fish.\n3. Which fish are highest in mercury? Shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish are generally highest in mercury and should be avoided by pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, and young children.\n4. Is farmed fish safer than wild-caught fish in terms of contaminants? It depends. Farmed fish might have lower mercury levels due to controlled environments, but they can have higher levels of other contaminants depending on their feed and farming practices.\n5. How can I reduce my exposure to contaminants when eating fish? Choose fish lower in mercury, such as salmon, trout, tilapia, cod, and sardines. Vary your fish intake and eat smaller portions. Properly prepare fish by removing the skin and trimming any visible fat, as contaminants tend to accumulate in these areas.\n6. What are the health risks associated with PCB exposure? PCBs can cause a range of health problems, including cancer, immune system suppression, reproductive issues, and developmental effects.\n7. Is it safe to eat canned tuna? Canned tuna can contain mercury, so it’s best to choose light tuna, which is generally lower in mercury than albacore tuna. Limit your intake based on guidelines from health organizations.\n8. What is sustainable seafood? Sustainable seafood comes from sources that are managed to maintain healthy populations and minimize environmental impact. Look for certifications like the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) label.\n9. How can I find sustainable seafood options? Consult resources like the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch guide, which provides recommendations for choosing sustainable seafood.\n10. Are there any benefits to eating fish that outweigh the risks? Yes. Fish is a good source of lean protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and essential vitamins and minerals. The key is to choose wisely and consume fish in moderation.\n11. Should pregnant women avoid eating fish altogether? No, but they should avoid high-mercury fish and limit their intake of other fish to the recommended amounts. Omega-3 fatty acids are important for fetal brain development.\n12. What are the risks of overfishing? Overfishing can deplete fish populations, disrupt marine ecosystems, and threaten the livelihoods of people who depend on fishing.\n13. What are the environmental impacts of aquaculture? Aquaculture can lead to water pollution, habitat destruction, and the spread of diseases to wild fish populations.\n14. Is it safe to eat raw fish? Eating raw fish carries a risk of foodborne illness from bacteria and parasites. Choose reputable restaurants and ensure that the fish is properly handled and stored.\n15. What are some alternatives to eating fish for omega-3 fatty acids? Plant-based sources of omega-3s include flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts, and algae-based supplements.\nIn conclusion, while fish can be a nutritious part of a balanced diet, it’s important to be aware of the potential cons, including contaminant exposure, overfishing, and aquaculture concerns. By choosing wisely, consuming fish in moderation, and supporting sustainable fishing practices, you can minimize the risks and enjoy the benefits of this food source responsibly.",

    "title": "Ireland’s Housing and Infrastructure Crisis Threatens Competitiveness for Foreign Investment",
    "text": "The Great Irish Housing Crisis: Can Simon Harris Put a Roof Over Our Heads? 🏡 Ah, the land of shamrocks and Guinness! Where the pubs are as plentiful as the tech companies, but the houses? Well, that’s another story entirely. It seems even the Irish Prime Minister, Simon Harris, is feeling the heat—or perhaps it’s just the pressure cooker of a housing crisis that’s boiling over. When your homes have become rarer than a good Wi-Fi connection in a Dublin pub, you know you’re in trouble.\nAt a recent US-Ireland summit, Harris pointed out that the ongoing shortage of homes and crumbling infrastructure could potentially put the brakes on Ireland’s competitiveness. And when it comes to foreign investment, it looks like Ireland’s infrastructure might be in worse shape than my love life after a series of disastrous first dates.\nNow, you see, attracting major US giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Intel is great—70% of direct investment sounds impressive until you realize half of those employees can’t find a place to live. Homes are so scarce in Dublin that finding one feels like hunting for leprechauns at this point. Savills has classified the housing crisis as “on a different level.” And by ‘different level,’ I think they mean ‘let’s make Amsterdam look like a suburban paradise.’\nHarris lamented the “extraordinary decade of economic and population growth”—a fancy way of saying people just keep coming to Ireland like it’s a reality TV audition rather than a country. He’s right; this is a little country, and with a fragmented approach to mega projects, it looks like we’re all stuck in a game of political tic-tac-toe while the rest of Europe zooms ahead.\nElaine Murphy, president of the American Chamber of Commerce, must be thinking it’s all well and good to say housing is a priority, but actions speak louder than words, right? She’s probably gearing up to give him a stern talking-to if he doesn’t deliver faster than a pizza from Dough Bros on a Friday night. With the stakes this high, she needs a narrative. Something like, “Ireland: The Place Where Your Tech Dreams Come True—Just Don’t Forget Your Sleeping Bag.”\nAnd let’s not even get started on public transport. Imagine living in a European country and having no metro system. The only thing more frustrating than trying to find a train is trying to find a parking spot in Dublin—good luck with that! Harris’s enthusiasm for fixing infrastructural deficits is like me at a buffet; it’s nice to see him dreaming big, but we both know how that usually ends.\nWhile all of this is happening, we’re sitting on a goldmine of corporate tax revenue—€38bn this year alone, half of it from those multinational companies. But the chicken-and-egg situation is looming: Rely too heavily on these giants and the Irish economy might become more fragile than my New Year’s resolutions.\nMichael Lohan, head of Ireland’s foreign investment agency, insists there’s no capital flight threat from that pesky ECJ ruling concerning Apple. He reassures us that investment isn’t just about tax anymore; you’ve got to sweet-talk with industrial policies and strategic planning. It’s like a Tinder date—nobody just swipes right on a profile unless there’s a decent conversation about future plans.\nSo, as Ireland tiptoes on this precarious tightrope of economic growth, housing shortages, and public transport chaos—one might wonder whether Harris can juggle these flaming torches without setting everything ablaze. It’s a pivotal time for the Emerald Isle, so let’s hope they figure it out before it becomes a cautionary tale told in every pub across the globe!\nIn conclusion, while the land of luck is famous for its potatoes and vibrant culture, perhaps it’s time for the Irish government to throw a few more bricks and mortar into the mix, or risk losing their shiny foreign investments to countries that might have more than just four walls to offer. They really need to get this “infrastructure delivery” under control—or at the very least, have a good joke ready for all those tech companies when they start packing their bags.\nInterview ⁣with Elaine Murphy:​ Tackling the Irish Housing Crisis\nEditor :‌ Welcome, Elaine,⁣ and thanks for joining​ us today. As the president of the American Chamber of Commerce, you’re at⁣ the⁤ heart of economic discussions concerning Ireland. With Prime Minister ⁤Simon Harris addressing the housing crisis at the recent US-Ireland summit, ⁢what are your thoughts on the current situation?\nElaine Murphy : Thank ‍you for having ‍me. It’s a daunting challenge, to say the least. The housing crisis is more than just a shortage of ⁣homes; it’s affecting our ability to‌ attract and‌ retain talent. When major U.S. companies invest⁣ here, they expect their employees to have access to ⁢adequate housing. Right now, ‌that’s a tall order.\nEditor : You mentioned ⁢that attracting investment is ⁢crucial, especially from giants like Apple and Microsoft.‍ How concerned are you that the​ housing situation might deter future investments?\nElaine Murphy : Absolutely concerned. The irony is that⁣ these companies want to bring jobs to Ireland, but if their employees can’t find housing, they may look elsewhere. The figures are alarming—up to 70% of direct investment comes from the U.S., yet many of those employees face housing turmoil. It’s like a revolving‌ door⁤ of opportunity that keeps closing.\nEditor : Prime Minister⁢ Harris has referred to the exceptional⁣ growth period Ireland has experienced. Do you think this growth has contributed to the housing crisis?\nElaine Murphy : Without a doubt. Rapid population growth has outpaced infrastructure‍ development, ​including housing. We need a strategic, cohesive⁤ approach ‌to⁤ mega projects. Right ‍now, it feels like we’re playing tic-tac-toe⁤ while our neighbors are racing ahead with their development.\nEditor : What can⁤ be done quickly to alleviate this crisis? Are there⁢ any immediate⁢ steps that you think could make‌ a difference?\nElaine Murphy : First, we need urgency from the government. A streamlined ‍planning process for new developments could help. Additionally, public-private partnerships could alleviate public sector burdens. And let’s not forget ​the need for improved ‍public transport; we need to expand options to live in suburban areas that are‍ more affordable.\nEditor : ​Simon Harris has acknowledged the importance of prioritizing⁣ housing. Do you believe his actions⁤ will speak louder⁤ than his words in the coming months?\nElaine Murphy : I⁢ truly hope so.​ Words ​are just words without action. I think he’s aware ⁣of the stakes—we‍ all are. The narrative needs to shift to a proactive one: “Ireland, the Land of Opportunity, ​but Bring Your Sleeping Bag.” We need tangible changes that match the grand rhetoric.\nEditor : In closing, what’s your message to the Irish government regarding this crisis?\nElaine Murphy : Address it with the urgency ‍and seriousness it deserves. Build homes, enhance public infrastructure, and ensure that Ireland ‍remains a competitive place‌ for investment. We​ can’t afford to let our housing crisis undermine our future.\nEditor :​ Thank you,⁢ Elaine. It’s clear that while the challenge is significant, there seems to be‍ a⁣ pathway to a brighter future with the right actions taken immediately.\nEnt, particularly in expediting housing developments and improving infrastructure. Streamlining planning processes and increasing funding for public projects could help put more roofs over heads. Additionally, we should consider innovative approaches like modular homes or public-private partnerships that can deliver housing solutions in a more timely manner. It’s going to take a concerted effort, but it can be done.\nEditor : Looking beyond the immediate crisis, how do you envision a long-term solution for Ireland’s housing challenges?\nElaine Murphy : Long-term, we need to re-evaluate our urban planning and ensure it’s sustainable. This involves creating balanced communities where people can live, work, and play. We should focus on developing comprehensive transportation networks that will enhance access to housing outside major city centers. The goal is to create an attractive living environment that appeals to both locals and expatriates while maintaining the charm that makes Ireland unique.\nEditor : Lastly, what message do you have for Prime Minister Harris regarding his responsibility in addressing the housing crisis?\nElaine Murphy : I would emphasize the need for decisive action and transparency. Our expectations are high, and while recognizing the challenge, it’s crucial that we see tangible results. The narrative must shift from discussion to implementation. If we want to position Ireland as a top destination for talent and investment, we need a coherent strategy that prioritizes housing as a fundamental right.\nEditor : Thank you, Elaine. Your insights shed light on a critical issue facing Ireland and the important balance between economic growth and providing adequate housing for its citizens and residents.\nElaine Murphy : Thank you for having me. Let’s hope for a future where every Irish citizen has a place to call home.",

    "title": "7 Religion Books for Battling Burnout",
    "text": "Books on the emotional, physical, and mental toll associated with burnout began flooding the mainstream market following the pandemic. Now, religion publishers are addressing the impact burnout can have on faith, and vice versa. “Stress management has been a strong felt need for a long time,” says Andrea Doering, executive editor at Revell. “But the rise in burnout as a topic readers are willing to admit to and address is more recent. That can be seen as a positive sign—if people are actively seeking remedies on these topics, there is hope for a better outcome for us all.” Al Hsu, associate editorial director at IVP, says the pandemic and the Great Resignation revealed “the widespread nature of people’s dissatisfaction with work.” “The exhaustion is real,” he says. “There are a lot of self-help books out there to help people with the practical skills needed to navigate challenging work and life realities, but the deeper issues are more existential.” Fatigue afflicts men and women alike, but several books are focusing specifically on women’s exhaustion, both in the home and at work. Below is a selection of new and forthcoming titles about burnout from faith-based publishers. Big Impact Without Burnout Bianca Best (Watkins, Mar. 2025) Best, an advertising executive turned entrepreneur and a mother of four, focuses on what she calls “graceful productivity,” or balancing the demands of work with the needs of one’s mind, body, and soul. The book details Best’s experience with severe burnout and includes advice on time management from women in professional leadership roles. Healthy Calling: From Toxic Burnout to Sustainable Work Arianna Molloy (IVP, Jan. 2025) Molloy, an associate professor of organizational communication at Biola University, draws on her research into productivity, motivation, and resilience to explore how a religious calling can help one manage the risk of burning out. A healthy calling, Molloy writes, requires “knowing yourself well, being teachable, and embracing the vulnerability of consistently taking time to rest and reflect.” Ignite Your Soul: When Exhaustion, Isolation, and Burnout Light a Path to Flourishing Mindy Caliguire (NavPress, Sept.) Caliguire, founder of Soul Care Ministry in Colorado, presents six practices—attention, participation, delight, humility, silence, and rest—intended to help readers heal from exhaustion. In promoting “whole-self flourishing,” the book, according to the publisher, also considers the various impacts of apathy, addiction, busyness, distraction, and fear. Love Your Kids Without Losing Yourself: 5 Steps to Banish Guilt and Beat Burnout When You Already Have Too Much to Do Morgan Cutlip (Thomas Nelson, Oct.) Psychotherapist Cutlip addresses perfectionism, comparison, and other difficulties associated with motherhood, offering suggestions for how to speak up and better care for oneself. The PLAN: Manage Your Time Like a Lazy Genius Kendra Adachi (Convergent, Oct.) Adachi, who encouraged readers to “do what matters, skip the rest” in The Lazy Genius Way, is following up with an alternate route to productivity in The PLAN, an acronym for prepare, live, adjust, and notice. (For PW’s q&a with Adachi, see “A Plan for Contentment,” p. 24.) Stronger Than Stress: 10 Spiritual Practices to Win the Battle of Overwhelm Barb Roose (Revell, Aug.) Roose, a Bible teacher, examines challenges in the life of the apostle Paul and invites Christians to follow his example in having a greater devotion and faith in God, despite chronic stress, anxiety, and other difficult circumstances. “Life is often more than we can handle, even for someone who has been walking with Jesus for a long time,” Roose writes. “Spiritual maturity doesn’t mean that you won’t experience overwhelm, but your connection with God keeps you from getting stuck there.” When Work Hurts: Building Resilience When You’re Beat Up or Burnt Out Meryl Herr (IVP, Mar. 2025) Herr, director of research and resources at Fuller Seminary’s Max De Pree Center for Leadership, focuses on work-related harms, such as trauma, harassment, disillusionment, and discouragement, as well as job loss. “Work can certainly break our bodies,” Herr writes. “But more often it breaks our hearts.”",

    "text": "Revel’s young supporters had implored Mbappe to make the trip to the game played at Castres – Revel’s humble stadium only has capacity for 2,000 fans in the Haute-Garonne south-western region – in a video posted on social media.\nAnd they got their wish with the 25-year-old star included in manager Luis Enrique’s strong travelling party to the leaders of Regional 1, five rungs below the capital giants in the French league ladder.\n“Kylian wanted to play and when he wants to play there’s not a lot you can say,” said Luis Enrique.\nMbappe evidently enjoyed his night out in the town near Toulouse, scoring a hat-trick to become PSG’s top scorer in the competition with a haul of 30 goals.\n“When he plays everyone wins – the staff, the fans, the rivals,” added the PSG coach.\nRevel defender Maxence N’Guesson did get on the scoresheet but sadly for an own goal as the first half drew to a close.\nPSG are hungry to add to their cup tally after missing out on the title in the past two seasons.\n“The French Cup is one of our objectives this season, we know its importance,” Luis Enrique said before the game.\nPSG were knocked out by Nice in 2022 and last season by Marseille, who also progressed from the round of 64 with a narrow win at Thionville, the hosts four leagues below the south coast giants – Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s 62nd minute shot making the difference.\nMonaco also lived to fight another day but only after a 6-5 penalty shoot out win over Ligue 1 rivals Lens after the teams were locked at 2-2.\nOn Saturday, having travelled nearly 7,000km from the Caribbean island of Martinique, Golden Lion got a 12-0 mauling from Ligue 1 big guns Lille.\nThe post Mbappe and PSG revel in nine-goal French Cup rout at sixth-tier amateurs appeared first on France 24 .",
