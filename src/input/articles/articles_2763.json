    "text": "Rick Slayman, the world’s [first living recipient of a genetically edited pig kidney transplant](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/21/health/pig-kidney-transplant-living-person/index.html), was discharged from the hospital Wednesday, two weeks after his operation, Massachusetts General Hospital said in a statement. “He is recovering well and will continue to recuperate at home with his family,” the hospital [said](https://twitter.com/MassGeneralNews/status/1775621590182457769) on X, formerly Twitter. In a [statement](https://www.massgeneral.org/news/rick-slayman-discharge-statement) issued by the hospital, Slayman said, “This moment — leaving the hospital today with one of the cleanest bills of health I’ve had in a long time — is one I wished would come for many years. Now, it’s a reality and one of the happiest moments of my life.” Slayman, a 62-year-old manager with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, had previously said his doctors suggested that he try a pig kidney when he was diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease last year. People are also reading… His doctors said last month that they thought Slayman’s new kidney could last years but also acknowledged that there are many unknowns in animal-to-human transplants. His surgery is the third such xenotransplant of a pig organ into a living human. The first two transplants were hearts transplanted into living patients that had run out of other transplant options. The organs were transplanted under special rules that permit compassionate use of experimental therapies for patients in especially dire situations. Both patients died weeks after receiving their organs. Slayman said he was grateful for the response to his surgery, especially from other patients who are waiting for a kidney transplant. The need for organs far outstrips the number that are available. Every day 17 people die in the U.S. waiting for an organ. Kidneys are the organ in shortest supply. According to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, roughly 27,000 kidneys were transplanted in 2023, but nearly 89,000 people were on the waitlist for those organs. ”Today marks a new beginning not just for me, but for them, as well,” Slayman said in the statement. ___ More than 100,000 people are on the organ donor wait list—here's who has the longest and shortest wait times More than 100,000 people are on the organ donor wait list—here's who has the longest and shortest wait times Heart transplant Heart and lung transplant Intestine transplant Kidney and pancreas transplant Liver transplant",

    "text": "I always watch what the federal government requires of its employees’ use of technology to get a feel for risks and what is coming down the pike from a regulatory standpoint—this has been going on for years. That’s why I was one of the first to get a cover for my laptop camera, why I have been concerned about traveling to foreign countries with laptops, and why I was worried about the use of geofencing and location-based services long before it was commonly understood (and I would argue it is still NOT commonly understood). A perfect example is that the federal government was the first to ban the use of TikTok by its employees. Then states followed, prohibiting state employees from using TikTok on state-issued phones. Why? Because it is spyware. Not long after, Congress passed a [bipartisan bill banning TikTok entirely](https://natlawreview.com/article/aid-package-signed-president-biden-includes-divestiture-tiktok-requirement). I predict the same will be true with GenAI tools. In April, the U.S. House “set a [strict ban](https://www.axios.com/2024/03/29/congress-house-strict-ban-microsoft-copilot-staffers) on congressional staffers’ use of Microsoft Copilot,” after restricting staffers’ use of ChatGPT last year. The reason? “The Microsoft Copilot application has been deemed by the Office of Cybersecurity to be a risk to users due to the threat of leaking House data to non-House approved cloud services.” Therefore, it “will be removed from and blocked on all House Windows devices.” There are a several risks with using GenAI tools in the workplace, including the risk of exposing company data. Although using these tools will make work lives more efficient, it is essential to understand the risks and manage them personally and professionally. I thought [this article by Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-workplace-privacy-security/) did a good job of explaining the risks in a cogent and efficient way and is worth a read",

    "text": "So you’ve decided to take a gamble on an electric vehicle, but you’d like to keep the ante down for getting into the game. There are lots of good reasons not to spend the kids’ college fund on the fanciest, six-figure EV — namely, sending them to college. Related: [Electric Vehicles: Understanding the Terminology](/articles/electric-vehicles-understanding-the-terminology-440188/) You might be just looking for an efficient second car for city use or commuting in high occupancy vehicle lanes, where it makes little sense to pay top dollar for 400 miles of range when a 200-mile EV would serve your needs. Or you might have figured out (accurately) that by the time your new EV’s lease or loan is finished, a wider selection of EVs with much improved technology will be available. Or the [higher-than-expected cost to install Level 2 home charging](/articles/what-it-cost-to-outfit-six-homes-with-ev-chargers-447239/), all but essential to owning an EV, might have shrunk your budget for the car itself. Whatever your reasons, there are EVs available now that won’t break the bank, though they’re generally still more expensive than comparable gasoline vehicles. Note that availability can be relative for EVs. [Some are sold only in certain states](/articles/how-to-buy-an-ev-that-is-not-sold-in-your-state-447911/), while others require a reservation for delivery weeks or months later. Below are 11 of the cheapest EVs you can buy, listed by starting price (including destination). The list features all-electric cars only; [plug-in hybrid](/articles/whats-the-difference-between-a-hybrid-and-a-plug-in-hybrid-1420700064361/) and [fuel-cell](/articles/what-are-hydrogen-cars-442319/) models are excluded. Prices do not include the federal government’s tax credit, nor any state or local subsidies. Of note, the federal subsidy has changed considerably as of Jan. 1, and additional guidelines for vehicle eligibility based on battery and materials sourcing were announced recently; [read our latest coverage here](/articles/what-does-the-ev-tax-credit-overhaul-mean-for-car-shoppers-455406/).
