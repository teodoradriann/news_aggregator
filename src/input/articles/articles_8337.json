    "title": "Boar's Head Publix-sold meat in listeria outbreak leads to lawsuit",
    "text": "A pregnant woman from Minnesota \"who nearly lost her unborn child\" is suing Boar's Head because she says she was infected by listeria after eating the company's deli meat sold at a Florida Publix, according to a release from the law firm . The Sarasota, Florida-based Boar's Head recalled about 7 million pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products with Boar’s Head and Old Country Brand names in July after a liverwurst sample tested positive for the outbreak strain of listeria. As of Thursday morning, 43 people in 13 states have been infected and hospitalized, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported . Three deaths have been connected to the recalled meat, the CDC said. Most of the infections have occurred in New York , according to CDC data. None have been reported in Florida to date, but the lawsuit says the woman, Ashley Solberg, bought the tainted meat at the Publix location at 1700 Sheridan Street in Hollywood while on vacation in Florida. Solberg v. Boar's Head Provisions, Co. Inc, filed in the District of Minnesota Wednesday and seeks \"an amount far greater than\" $75,000, is the first federal lawsuit over the tainted meat, according to the release. But it's not the only lawsuit. The recall came after a Missouri couple filed a lawsuit in July alleging the company's deli meats made one of them, an 88-year-old woman, \"deathly ill.\" On Aug. 1, a proposed class-action suit was filed in a New York federal district court. Why is a Minnesota woman suing Boar's Head? According to her representation, OFT Food Safety & Injury Lawyers, Minnesota resident Solberg was 36 weeks pregnant and on vacation Florida when she bought and ate some Boar's Head sliced ham and turkey from the Hollywood Publix. After returning home, she \"started to become severely ill, suffering from diarrhea, fever, chills, headaches, and body aches, among other symptoms,\" the lawsuit says. Testing verified it was listeriosis, and sample testing from the Minnesota Department of Health and CDC matched it to the outbreak strain, the lawsuit states. Solberg was hospitalized for six days and given an intensive antibiotic treatment to protect her unborn child, which continued after her release. \"Even today, Plaintiff is concerned about the lasting impact of the infection just before her labor and delivery,\" the lawsuit says. Pregnant women are 10 times more likely than other people to get a listeria infection , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \"The risks of a Listeria infection during pregnancy include miscarriage, premature labor, low-birth-weight infant, and infant death,\" the release said. \"Because the mother can easily pass the infection to her unborn child, the infected fetus can also develop a range of health issues, including intellectual disability, paralysis, seizures, blindness, or impairments of the brain, heart, or kidney.\" Solberg is suing for \"an amount far greater than Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00),\" plus other court costs and \"other relief as the court may find just and equitable,\" the lawsuit states. Why did Boar's Head recall its deli meat? On Friday, July 26, Boar's Head Provisions Co. announced it was recalling 207,528 pounds of liverwurst products and additional deli meat products produced on the same line and on the same day as the liverwurst. A company spokesperson confirmed all of the recalled products were produced in the company's Jarratt facility in Virginia. Less than a week later, the company said it was now recalling about 7 million additional pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products after a liverwurst sample collected by the Maryland Department of Health tested positive for the outbreak strain of listeria. Boar's Head pulled 71 products produced between May 10 and July 29 under the Boar’s Head and Old Country brand names. ➤ Full list of items included in recall The recalled food \"includes meat intended for slicing \" at retail delis as well as some packaged meat and poultry products sold at retail locations with \"sell-by\" dates ranging from July 29 through Oct. 17, 2024, according to a news release from the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Food Safety and Inspection Service. The products have the establishment number “EST. 12612” or “P-12612” inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels. \"On behalf of all of us at Boar’s Head Brand, we want to let our customers and consumers know that we deeply regret that our liverwurst products were found to be adulterated with Listeria monocytogenes,\" Boar's Head said in their latest statement about the recall . \"No words can fully express our sympathies and the sincere and deep hurt we feel for the families that have suffered losses and others who endured illness.\" Searchable list of Boar's Head recalled products Where were the recalled items made by Boar's Head sold? The products subject to recall were distributed to retail locations nationwide. Some were exported to the Cayman Islands, Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Panama. 3 dead, 43 sickened by Boar's Head listeria outbreak The outbreak has killed three people and affected 43 across 13 states as of Aug. 8, 2024, the CDC said. The first two deaths were reported in Illinois and New Jersey, the latest has not yet been released. Sicknesses by state: - New York: 14 - Maryland: 8 - Massachusetts: 3 - Georgia: 2 - Missouri: 3 - Virginia: 3 - New Jersey: 4 - Minnesota: 1 - Illinois: 1 - Indiana: 1 - North Carolina: 1 - Pennsylvania: 1 - Wisconsin: 1 \"The true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely higher than the number reported,\" said food safety lawyer William Marler in a release, \"because some people recover without medical care and are not tested for Listeria even when they do seek care.\" Missouri couple file lawsuit over 'life-threatening listeria infection' Patrick and Sue Fleming of High Ridge, Missouri, filed a complaint July 26 alleging that Sue Fleming endured a \"life-threatening listeria infection\" after they bought Boar's Head liverwurst in June. Sue, 88, required a long hospital stay and rehab as she experienced nausea, diarrhea, stomach cramping, and, \"most disturbingly, intense whole-body aches, shaking, and muscle weakness,\" the complaint says. The complaint says that she continues to suffer \"neurological symptoms, fatigue, and overall weakness.” This lawsuit was filed by the same firm representing the pregnant Minnesota woman. Lawsuit filed over listeria: Boar's Head recall expands to 7 million pounds of deli meat Why was a class action suit proposed against Boar's Head? In August a class action lawsuit , Torres v. Boar’s Head Provisions Co. Inc., was filed in a New York federal district court, accusing Boar's Head of \"deceptive and misleading business practices\" for omitting and not disclosing to consumers on its packaging that the recalled products ― including ham, pork loin, bologna, salami, cheese, liverwurst, bacon, frankfurters, brats and sausage ― were contaminated with listeria. The suit expects to cover anyone in the U.S. who bought any of the recalled Boar's Head products. Has anyone in Florida gotten sick from the Boar's Head listeria outbreak? No illnesses have been reported in Florida , according to the Centers for Disease Control. Publix removes Boar's Head products from stores Publix carries Boar's Head products at Publix Super Markets and Publix GreenWise Markets. After the recall was announced on July 26, Publix posted on its website : \"We take our responsibility for our customers' safety very seriously. We vigilantly monitor regulatory agencies, so we're among the first to know when a product recall or food safety warning is issued. If a recall or warning occurs, we immediately alert store locations to remove the product from the shelves (if sold there). We post details here on Publix.com to keep you informed.\" What should you do if you purchased any of the recalled meat? \"FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ refrigerators and in retail deli cases. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them and retailers are urged not to sell these products with the referenced sell by dates. \"These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. Consumers who have purchased these products are also urged to clean refrigerators thoroughly to prevent the risk of cross-contamination.\" Consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Boar’s Head Provisions Co., Inc., Customer Service at 1-800-352-6277. Boar's Head headquarters located in Sarasota, Florida Founded in 1905 in the New York City area, https://boarshead.com/ has been headquartered in Sarasota since 2001. The company is located at 1819 Main St. Suite 800. Company founder Frank Brunckhorst was dissatisfied with the quality of hams available and \"set out to craft products of uncompromising standards by using only the finest ingredients. Over the years, our company has grown, but our standards for quality have never wavered.\" The company's mission statement said: \"Our mission is to continue to be recognized as the leading provider of exceptional customer service and superior quality delicatessen products.\" What are listeria? Listeria are bacteria that can contaminate many foods, according to the CDC. What are symptoms of a listeria infection? Symptoms typically start a week to four weeks after eating contaminated food. Symptoms typically include: - Fever - Flu-like symptoms, such as muscle aches and fatigue - Headache - Stiff neck - Confusion - Loss of balance - Seizures Who is most at risk from listeria? The bacteria are most likely to sicken people w h o are pregnant and their newborns , adults aged 65 or older , and people with weakened immune systems . Other people can be infected with listeria, but they rarely become seriously ill. Listeriosis mostly affects pregnant women. About 1 in 6 cases of listeriosis are associated with pregnancy , according to the Florida Department of Health. How can you avoid listeria? Especially for those in high-risk groups, the CDC offers the following suggestions to avoid the listeria bacteria found in food. Do not eat: - Unpasteurized soft cheeses, such as queso fresco and brie. - Unheated cheeses sliced at a deli. - Unheated deli meat, cold cuts, hot dogs, and fermented or dry sausages. - Premade deli salads, such as coleslaw and potato, tuna, or chicken salad. - Refrigerated pâté or meat spreads. - Refrigerated smoked fish. - Raw or lightly cooked sprouts. - Cut melon left out for more than 2 hours. One hour if it’s exposed to temperatures hotter than 90 degrees. - Cut melon in refrigerator for more than a week. - Raw (unpasteurized) milk, yogurt, and ice cream. Can listeria on food be killed? Listeria is easily killed by heating f ood to a high enough temperature, the CDC said. Do not eat meats that have been sliced at any deli counter unless it is reheated to an internal temperature of 165 degrees or until steaming hot. Let it cool before you eat it.

    "text": "SHEPHERDSTOWN — In one month, the 21st annual American Conservation Film Festival (ACFF) will be returning to Shepherdstown. A total of 27 films will be screened in Shepherd University’s Frank Arts Center Theater at this year’s festival, which will be held from March 7-10. “Our purpose from the beginning has been to present conservation-focused films and programs that engage, inform and inspire audiences to protect the natural world. This year, we’ll have all films presented with open captions, which is helpful to a lot of people,” ACFF Director Hilary Lo said. “We could all use some uplifting news, so this year’s films highlight conservation heroes and the new solutions they’re working on.” According to Lo, this year’s festival will feature a decreased number of films, as the result of audience feedback. “The number of films is actually fewer this year than pre-pandemic, after feedback from loyal festivalgoers that there were just too many for people to try to see,” Lo said, noting she anticipates an increase in this year’s attendance. “People want to get back to the experience of watching films together, connecting with each other, as well as with filmmakers and conservation experts. “Audience engagement is part of ACFF’s purpose – with films, filmmakers and with the community,” Lo added, before sharing how the pandemic led to changes in the festival’s event schedule. “After two years of online festivals, we missed our fans and really wanted to focus on reconnecting the community. We have been building partnerships with local businesses such as Alma Bea, which will host this year’s community dinner, Four Seasons Books and author Leah Rampy, as well as Shepherd University’s Center for Appalachian Studies and Communities and Lifelong Learning program. This year, we are co-sponsoring programs with West Virginia Nature Conservancy and Potomac Valley Audubon Society, too.” Festival passes and tickets to individual events or films can be purchased in advance at [https://conservationfilmfest.org](https://conservationfilmfest.org). Films are free to watch for students 18 and under and college students with ID. Lo noted the festival features events for adults, as well as for the family. “In addition to gorgeous films that transport you to hard-to-reach places all around the world, the festival brings audiences together with filmmakers and expert speakers to take part in post-film (question-and-answer sessions),” Lo said. “There are family-friendly films and kids’ eco-activities, too.” Some speaker highlights will include question-and-answer sessions with Everglades Avengers Team Leader Donna Kalil, from the 2023 short “Python Huntress”; filmmaker and actor David Lee (of “Get Smart” and “Black Panther” fame), who won ACFF’s 2024 Green Fire Award and wrote “The Last Ranger,” which will be featured in this year’s festival; and straw bale house owner Jeff Feldman, who previously owned a green building consulting firm. According to Lo, one way ACFF differs from other film festivals is in the way it screens its short films. “We’ve always screened some shorts but, for the past couple of years, we’ve presented film blocks, which run about an hour, comprised of several juried shorts. We love shorts, because concise storytelling is an art. Additionally, with so many topics to cover from around the world, we can offer a wider variety of subjects with shorts,” Lo said. “Every evening, we’ll also be screening full-length feature films, which are chosen for their relevance to our community and current issues.” Another notable difference between ACFF and other film festivals has been its longevity. “The average film festival in the United States makes it two years,” Lo said of the festival, which was founded in 2003.",

During that time, AAA will provide a free ride and vehicle tow to impaired drivers that do not have an alternative way to get home.\n“Many individuals will celebrate by partaking in alcoholic beverages,” stated the Marion County Sheriff’s Office in a social media post. “Please be responsible! If you drink, don’t drive, and don’t be the reason you or someone else doesn’t make it home.”\nSince 1998, the “Tow to Go” program has successfully removed nearly 30,000 impaired drivers off the road, according to AAA.\nThe free confidential ride is available to members of AAA as well as non-members, and a tow truck will take the vehicle and driver home or to a safe location within a ten-mile radius. In some instances, AAA may need to find other arrangements to help get an impaired individual to their home.\nAppointments cannot be scheduled in advance, and the “Tow to Go” program might not be available in rural areas or during severe weather conditions. The program operates on most major holidays.\nTo learn more about the program, visit the\nAAA “Tow to Go” website or call 1-855-286-9246.",

    "text": "By Suleiman Al-Khalidi\nAMMAN (Reuters) -Israel carried out an aerial strike targeting a main Syrian air defence base in southern Syria on Thursday in the latest bombing campaign since the outbreak of war in Gaza on Oct. 7, Syrian army and intelligence sources said.\nCiting a Syrian military source, state media had earlier said missile strikes coming from the direction of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights had targeted several sites it did not identify.\n\"Our air defences confronted the (Israeli) aggressors' missiles and downed some of them with only material losses,\" a Syrian military source said.\nLater, a Syrian army source was quoted on state media as saying Israel staged another round of strikes after midnight near the capital but gave no details.\nReuters could not independently verify the report. There was no immediate comment from Israel's military.\nSince the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israeli civilians and soldiers, Israel has escalated its strikes on Iranian-backed militia targets in Syria and also struck Syrian army air defences and some Syrian forces.\nThe strikes are believed to have targeted a Syrian army air defence base and a radar station in the Tel al-Sahn area in the Sweida province in southwestern Syria, according to a Syrian military intelligence source and another regional security official familiar with the matter.\nLast month, another anti-aircraft defence system in Tel Qulaib and Tel Maseeh in southern Syria were hit in what the senior intelligence sources said was an intensified campaign by Israel to disrupt Syrian air defence systems that Iran was involved in expanding.\n\"Tehran is stepping up its efforts to provide Syria with air defence systems that can potentially erode of the effectiveness of Israeli strikes,\" said another regional military source who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\"This is related to the Gaza war calculations in the event of the conflict spreading,\" he added.\nIsrael has for years carried out attacks on what it has described as Iran-linked targets in Syria, where Tehran's influence has grown since it began supporting President Bashar al-Assad in a civil war that started in 2011.\nThe strikes are part of an escalation of what has been a low-intensity conflict with a goal of slowing Iran's growing entrenchment in Syria, Israeli military experts say.\nFighters allied with Iran, including Hezbollah, now hold sway in vast areas in eastern, southern and northwestern Syria and in several suburbs around the capital.\n(Reporting by Ahmed Tolba, Yomna Ehab, Enas Alashray and Suleiman al Khalidi; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Stephen Coates)\nCopyright 2023 Thomson Reuters .\nJoin the Conversation See Comments Read More",

    "title": "Vatican Will Become the Eighth Country to Achieve 100 Percent Renewable Energy – Here’s the Full List",
    "text": "This week has been pretty dismal when it comes to climate news. From the wildfires in Türkiye and Greece to the storms over Switzerland, Italy, France and the hurricane over the Caribbean , it’s clear that the climate emergency is impacting our weather.\nBut it’s not all fiery doom and windy gloom – there’s been some positive news about the climate this week, too. That’s because Vatican City is soon set to generate 100 percent of its electricity from renewable energy, with Pope Francis announcing plans to build a solar plant.\nIt will be located just outside of Rome on a 424-hectare site owned by the Vatican, and will add capacity to existing solar panel installations within the Italian capital. When the works are completed, the Vatican will become the smallest country (by land mass) to be entirely energy-independent.\nVatican will join seven other countries around the world that generate at least 99.7 percent of their energy from renewable sources of power. They are:\nAlbania Bhutan Nepal Paraguay Iceland Ethiopia Democratic Republic of Congo What’s more, 40 countries generated at least 50 percent of their electricity from renewable sources between 2021 and 2022, and 11 of these are in Europe . Germany is capable of running off 100 percent of its renewable sources for short periods of time, and the UK ’s proportion of green-generated electricity jumped by 10.5 percent between 2021 and 2022.\nIn Scotland , renewable tech generated the equivalent of 113 percent of the country’s electricity consumption in 2022, and while most of this was wind power, a switch to solar power over the coming decades has been predicted by experts. In fact, scientists at the University of Exeter and University College London believe solar power will become the world’s main source of energy by 2050.\n‘Due to technological trajectories set in motion by past policy, a global irreversible solar tipping point may have passed where solar energy gradually comes to dominate global electricity markets, without any further climate policies,’ said researchers who published a study in Nature Communications , according to the Independent , ‘Solar energy is the most widely available energy resource on Earth, and its economic attractiveness is improving fast in a cycle of increasing investments.’\nSo there you have it – while there’s still a long way to go, not all climate news is bad news. Stay tuned for more updates.\nDid you see that this country officially has the cleanest coastal water in Europe ?\nPlus: This city has been named Europe’s leading sustainable tourism destination .\nStay in the loop: sign up to our free Time Out Travel newsletter for all the latest travel news.",

    "text": "(RNS) — After months of allegations that it lacks a credible process for disciplining its bishops, the\nEpiscopal Church is taking steps to make it simpler to report misconduct, Presiding Bishop Michael Curry said in an announcement Thursday (Feb. 22).\n“Given the current atmosphere, I have chosen to exercise my canonical discretion to adopt a general protocol for transparency in Title IV matters involving Bishops,” Curry wrote in a\nletter delivered to the Episcopal Church’s House of Bishops, referring to the denomination’s internal mechanism for holding clergy accountable.\nThe changes are intended to address a string of allegations against Episcopal bishops and come after lay and ordained Episcopalians have voiced their\nconcerns about Title IV publicly.\nRELATED:\nThe Episcopal Church Reckons With Tangled Protocol on Clergy Abuse and Accountability\nLast year, Julia Ayala Harris, who as president of the Episcopal House of Deputies is the second-highest ranking officer of the church, made public a\nhttps://myemail.constantcontact.com/Letter-to-Deputies-.html?soid=1111106056536&aid=nI86yOcW9vQ&mibextid=Zxz2cZ detailing her concerns about her own experience after she filed a formal complaint against a retired bishop who, she said, had subjected her to “non-consensual physical contact” and “inappropriate verbal statements.” Rather than discipline the bishop, the church referred him to pastoral counseling.\nThat same year, a priest filed a Title IV complaint against Florida Bishop John Howard, alleging he discriminated against LGBTQ clergy and supporters. In December 2022, Michigan Bishop Prince Singh was accused by his sons and ex-wife of physical and emotional abuse, but no Title IV process was begun for six months.\nIn September 2023, 55 Episcopal bishops aired their concerns in an open letter about the “perception — or the reality — that bishops get a free pass on behavioral issues.” In response, Curry instructed the church’s Standing Commission on Structure, Governance, Constitution and Canons to “recommend to the General Convention (the church’s governing body) needed canonical and procedural changes in ecclesiastical discipline of bishops.”\nThe Standing Commission has collected feedback on the Title IV process and, according to a spokesperson from the Episcopal Church, will publish a report on this topic in anticipation of the General Convention this summer. It is yet to be seen whether the report will focus on bishops’ misconduct or Title IV as a whole.\nLast year, the denomination tapped the Rev. Barbara Kempf, a priest and attorney, to be the Title IV intake officer for bishops, ensuring that a nonbishop is serving in that role. Curry’s letter also indicates that Kempf is in the “early stages” of assembling a pastoral response team for those impacted by Title IV processes involving bishops.\nThe changes announced Thursday include clearer instructions for reporting bishop misconduct on the denomination’s website, public updates on Title IV processes involving bishops and a new annual statistical report on Title IV cases involving bishops.\nA blue “Report Misconduct” button now appears in the top right corner of the Episcopal Church’s\nhomepage. The button leads to an informational page on Title IV with a step-by-step breakdown of Title IV processes involving bishops and a link to report bishops.\nThe website also includes a new list of public Title IV cases involving bishops. In his letter, Curry explained that the list will be updated at his discretion and will include the status of each complaint.\n“In the canons we see a balancing of the benefits of transparency against the benefits of some measure of privacy,” Curry wrote. “Striking the right balance may help us get closer to the lofty goals set out in Canon I of Title IV — ‘healing, repentance, forgiveness, restitution, justice, amendment of life and, reconciliation among all involved or affected.’”\nNivedhan Singh, Bishop Singh’s elder son, said the new Title IV updates feel like too little, too late. “Transparency without accountability is useless to us,” Nivedhan told Religion News Service. An improved website, he said, doesn’t help if the Title IV process itself is mishandled or causes additional harm to abuse survivors.\nPrince Singh, who resigned in September, is facing two Title IV investigations — the second involves allegations of improper behavior from his time as bishop of Rochester, New York. Curry and Bishop Todd Ousley, the former intake officer for Title IV complaints involving bishops, are also the subjects of\nongoing Title IV complaints related to their response to the Singhs’ abuse allegations.\nNivedhan Singh said the updates function as an “admission of guilt” that reveals the denomination’s awareness that something in the Title IV process is broken, but he said the denomination failed to apologize to those the process has already harmed.\nNivedhan Singh continues to call for an independent, third-party investigation into the actions of the presiding bishop and Ousley, and for pastoral care for his family, an element of the Title IV process he claims has not been fulfilled.\nCurry, who has been receiving medical treatment for internal bleeding and heart conditions, is in the last year of his nine-year term.\nThis article originally appeared\nhere.",

    "text": "Customers are flocking to Chick-fil-A in Citrus Plaza, which reopened Thursday, Dec. 28, after a 4½-month expansion. Changes include a widened drive-thru with two lanes narrowing to one after customers order, a reconfigured dining room and new restrooms with key pads on their doors to limit entrance. The restaurant [closed in mid-August](https://www.redlandsdailyfacts.com/2023/09/19/whats-happening-at-the-chick-fil-a-in-citrus-plaza/) for the project, which included tearing down some exterior walls. Citrus Plaza is in the “ [Donut Hole](https://www.sbsun.com/2014/04/20/construction-starts-in-controversial-donut-hole-near-redlands/),” an unincorporated area outside of Redlands city limits, although the city provides water, sewer, police and fire services in exchange for tax revenue. Contacted in September, representatives for San Bernardino County said the expansion increases storage space for an expected boost in drive-thru business, which was already brisk. Hours are 6:30 a.m.-9 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday and 10:30 a.m.-9 p.m. Monday, according to the restaurant’s website. All Chick-fil-A restaurants are closed Sunday. The address is 27520 W Lugonia Ave. Information: [chick-fil-a.com](https://www.chick-fil-a.com/locations/ca/citrus-plaza)",
