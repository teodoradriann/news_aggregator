    "text": "Oscars 2024: Oscars 2024: Ramy Youssef, Billie Eilish and more call for ceasefire\nAt the red carpet of the 96th edition of the\nAcademy Awards in March 10th in Los Angeles, Poor Things star Ramy Yousseff and Billie Eilish were among the artists to express their support for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nThe two aforementioned nominees wore a red pin bearing a Artists4Ceasefire symbol, as did Eilish’s brother and collaborator, Finneas. They are an organisation calling for “an immediate de-escalation and ceasefire in Gaza and Israel before another life is lost.”\nAdditionally, filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania, and producer Nadim Cheikhrouha were also seen wearing the Artists4Ceasefire red pin. Meanwhile,\nAnatomy of a Fall star Milo Machado-Graner showed his support for Palestine by wearing a Palestenian flag pin.\nExplaining his decision to support Artists4Ceasefire, Yousseff told\nVariety on the red carpet: “We’re calling for immediate, permanent ceasefire in Gaza. We’re calling for peace and lasting justice for the people of Palestine. It’s a universal message of, ‘Let’s stop killing kids. Let’s not be part of more war.’ No one has ever looked back at war and thought a bombing campaign was a good idea.”\nYousseff continued: “To be surrounded by so many artists who are willing to lend their voices, the list is growing. A lot of people are going to be wearing these pins tonight. We want to use where we’re at to speak to people’s hearts. There’s a lot of talking heads on the news, this is a space of talking hearts. We’re trying to have this big beam to humanity. There’s no other route.”\nThe Poor Things actor concluded: “It’s taking so long, the president has called for it in the State of the Union. We need to look at ourselves and be honest, if the leadership supposedly thinks that should happen, why has it not happened? That’s what we’re all encouraging everyone to be vocal about.”\nIn total, Poor Things is\nnominated for 11 awards at the Oscars, including ‘Best Picture’. Yorgos Lanthimos is also up for the ‘Best Director’ prize.\nMeanwhile, Eilish and Finneas’ contribution to the Barbie soundtrack, ‘What Was I Made For?’, is nominated for ‘Best Original Song’. The duo are also set to perform at the ceremony.",

    "title": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk Tries To Lower Expectations Of $30K Optimus Or Cybercab - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)",
    "text": "Tesla Inc. TSLA CEO Elon Musk on Thursday tempered down customer expectations of purchasing the company’s dedicated robotaxi offering – the Cybercab – and its humanoid robot called Optimus for about $30,000 each, saying it would be possible only on the “long-term.” What Happened: Production needs to exceed a million a year before the company can sell the two products for about $30,000, Musk said. “We need to reach >1M/year production volumes, but, long-term, yes,” he wrote in a post on X, without clarifying if he is hinting towards a collective production volume of a million or a million individually for both the products. Tall Promises: During Tesla's annual shareholder meeting in June, Musk said that there will be at least one humanoid robot for every person in the world in the future, implying a total humanoid robot population of at least 10 billion or more, of which the EV company will have a significant share. Musk then said that he expects to be able to sell Optimus at a price point below $30,000 once it reaches high-volume production. In July, the CEO said that the EV company would have \"genuinely useful\" humanoid robots in low production for use within its factories next year. The company will \"hopefully\" increase production for other customers in 2026, he said. As for the Cybercab, Tesla unveiled the car with no pedals or steering wheel in October. The vehicle, CEO Elon Musk then said, will enter production \"before 2027\" and be priced below $30,000. History Of Underdelivering: Musk is known for providing price points that the company cannot deliver. During the Cybertruck’s unveiling in November 2019, Musk presented tentative pricing for the stainless steel truck. The dual-motor all-wheel-drive (AWD) variant was projected to begin at $49,900 but is now priced at $79,990 in the U.S. The top-tier tri-motor all-wheel drive was projected to start at $69,900 but is now priced at a whopping $99,990 .

    "text": "El dirigente Luis D’Elía señaló que la protesta es “una clara pelea contra la reinstalación del modelo neoliberal”.\nOrganizaciones sociales de Argentina realizaron este jueves un corte en la Ruta Nacional 3 de la provincia de Buenos Aires, específicamente en el sector La Matanza, para expresar su rechazo a las recientes medidas anunciadas por el Gobierno del ultraderechista Javier Milei.\nLEA TAMBIÉN:\nPresidente argentino envía \"Ley ómnibus\" al parlamento\nDe acuerdo con medios locales e internacionales, entre otras agrupaciones, el Frente Barrial de la Central de Trabajadores de la Argentina (CTA), el Sindicato de los Canillitas y la Federación de Tierra, Vivienda y Hábitat (FTV) encabezaron la manifestación que inició a las 10H00 hora local (03H00 GMT).\nEl dirigente de FTV, Luis D’Elía, señaló que la protesta constituye “una clara pelea contra la reinstalación del modelo neoliberal conservador en su versión más cruel”, mientras acusó a Milei de representar los intereses de multinacionales estadounidenses.\nEsta Ruta 3, es un lugar histórico de los piquetes. Y hoy estamos acá manifestándonos, en contra del decreto ómnibus de Milei que consagra para todos los tiempos, el modelo neoliberal conservador que ya nos hizo tanto daño. pic.twitter.com/ZmKr3FQnTu\n— Luis D'Elia (@Luis_Delia) December 28, 2023 En este sentido, D’Elía denunció que las transnacionales “vienen por el litio, por el gas, por el oro, por el petróleo y por el agua”. Aseguró que las manifestaciones continuarán hasta que “caiga” el decreto de necesidad y urgencia (DNU) rubricado la semana pasada por el ultraliberal presidente argentino.\nFuentes argentinas precisaron que el corte tuvo lugar en el tramo de la ruta denominado Brigadier General Juan Manuel de Rosas, específicamente en el cruce con las vías de Belgrano Sur.\nEsta movilización fue correctamente anunciada y recordamos, que la Gendarmería tiene solo jurisdicción sobre la ruta 3 y que nuestro acto cuenta con autorización municipal sobre la calle Germán Abdala. pic.twitter.com/LYuO6EeXr9\n— Luis D'Elia (@Luis_Delia) December 28, 2023 La víspera, el mandatario envió al Congreso un proyecto legislativo conocido como “ley ómnibus” que avanza con la desregulación de la economía a través de más de 600 artículos.\nDe igual forma, la propuesta de normativa declara el estado de emergencia pública hasta el 31 de diciembre de 2025, lo que limitaría las funciones del seno legislativo.",

    "text": "MONCKS CORNER — A 20-year-old man has been arrested in connection with a Dec. 20 double homicide in a Berkeley County mobile home park. Isaiah Bennett of North Charleston was arrested Dec. 28 by Berkeley County Sheriff's officers and charged with two counts of murder. Bennett was booked into the Hill-Finklea Detention Center, according to a news release from the sheriff's office. He has [no felony convictions](https://www.postandcourier.com/tncms/asset/editorial/5b0abd90-a318-11ee-8f96-839ddd2cddb4/) locally, according to court records in Berkeley, Charleston and Dorchester counties. On Dec. 20, officers were called to the Summer Creek Mobile Home Park on College Park Road on a call about gunshots and a person lying in the roadway. Officers found 21-year-old Ismael Rodriguez and [15-year-old](https://www.postandcourier.com/tncms/asset/editorial/9e4fc642-797c-11ee-98b2-c335a34b2da2/) Jose Nieto shot to death. Since the shooting deaths, sheriff's officers worked on the case through the Christmas holiday, Berkeley County Sheriff Duane Lewis said in the Dec. 28 news release. \"We are thankful to the community for the assistance and tips that helped bring this case to a closure,\" the sheriff noted. Officers are continuing to investigate the case and ask anyone with additional information to contact the sheriff's office at 843-719-4465 or [sheriff.berkeleycountysc.gov/apply/give-us-a-tip](http://sheriff.berkeleycountysc.gov/apply/give-us-a-tip).",
