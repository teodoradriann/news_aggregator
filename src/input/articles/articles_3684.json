    "text": "(The Center Square) – The Tennessee Titans have been valued at anywhere from $4.9 billion to $6 billion recently, more than a 10% rise from last year. The Nashville-based franchise is owned by Amy Adams Strunk and is currently in the process of building a new Nissan Stadium next to the current Nissan Stadium using $1.27 billion in public funds while gathering an estimated [$3.1 billion in captured taxes](https://www.thecentersquare.com/tennessee/article_f0ddf3a4-dac9-11ed-8759-97fb8c8dc3f5.html) during the life of the new lease. The Titans ranked 23rd of the NFL’s 32 teams in value by both Forbes and CNBC. Forbes valued the Titans at [$4.9 billion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/justinteitelbaum/2024/08/29/the-nfls-most-valuable-teams-2024/), up 11% from a year before, while CNBC valued the franchise at [$6.0 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/05/official-nfl-team-valuations-2024.html). Both rankings had the Dallas Cowboys as the first NFL franchise valued at more than $10 billion. The Adams family purchased the Titans franchise, then the Houston Oilers, for $25,000 in 1959. The team had an estimated $521 million in revenue in 2022. The NFL reportedly earned more than [$13 billion](https://www.thecentersquare.com/tennessee/article_2d944d14-3e0d-11ef-a9c8-9bc765b5ef40.html) and distributed more than $400 million in 2023 to each team from national revenue.",

    "text": "On August 12, the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, issued a press statement commemorating the anniversary of the adoption of the Geneva Conventions.\nHe said: “The 75th anniversary of the adoption of the 1949 Geneva Conventions is a fitting occasion to reaffirm our commitment to respecting international humanitarian law… We call on others to do the same.”\nExcept Israel.\nBlinken added: “Faced with the horrible reality of war, parties to armed conflict must comply with international humanitarian law to mitigate many of war’s worst humanitarian consequences, support pathways to peace, and advance the protection of civilians and other victims.”\nExcept Israel.\nOf course, Blinken did not add the words “except Israel” but he should have, considering what had happened just two days earlier.\nOn August 10, Israel dropped bombs on a school sheltering displaced Palestinians, killing over 100 and injuring hundreds more.\nThe New York Times reported that one witness “said he found a scene of carnage unlike any he had seen in the past 10 months of war: A prayer hall strewed with bodies and body parts over two floors.” Another witness said “the dead were all in pieces.”\nCNN said there was “no advance warning of the attack” and reported that the director for ambulance and emergency services said, “All of these people who were targeted were civilians, unarmed children, the elderly, men and women.”\nNBC News described the event as “one of the deadliest attacks in the 10-month war” and said the strikes hit the school “during dawn prayers.” The network reported, “The White House said it was deeply concerned.” Two days earlier, Secretary Blinken announced that the US was sending billions more to Israel in a new weapons package.\nThe Financial Times quoted a surgeon as saying, “This was a very bloody day,” and that he had performed several amputations including on at least four children.\nWar deaths in Gaza have now passed 40,000 with thousands more still buried under the rubble. At least two-thirds were women and children. Over 95 percent of the people in Palestine were not members of Hamas.\nJeffrey Sachs is a world-renowned economist and foreign policy expert and holds the highest rank awarded by Columbia University. He is a Jew and a fierce critic of this war.\nHe said during Judge Napolitano’s August 13th podcast that Israel is now a “completely lawless country.” He said Israel is “doing whatever it can to provoke” war in the Middle East and “this is not what the American people want.”\nHe added that “Netanyahu and his party want no Palestinian state and this means no peace.” He said this is what the Israel Lobby wants.\nNetanyahu received 50 standing ovations when he spoke to the Congress on July 24. None of these members would have applauded the killing of thousands of children in any other country. In fact, they would have been rushing to condemn it.\nProfessor Sachs has said in many interviews that the US is “complicit in the genocide” that is still going on in Gaza. He says this war would not last one more day without US support.\nI believe God will punish the members of Hamas who did horrible things to Jewish people last October 7. But I also believe that God loves the innocent people of Palestine, too, especially the little children.\nPsalm 147 says: “The Lord builds up Jerusalem, He gathers together the outcasts of Israel. He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.” There are certainly no more outcast people in Israel today than those living at the brink of starvation in Gaza.\nThe Bible also instructs us, in both the Old Testament and the New Testament, to “seek peace and pursue it.”\nA few weeks ago the US supported a UN resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire. Netanyahu has ignored this because he either wants to kill all the Palestinian people or at least ethnically cleanse them out of Israel.\nWe are $35 trillion in debt. We are spending money we do not have to support this war. Almost every member of Congress is scared to death that the Israel Lobby will spend millions against them if they speak out against Netanyahu. I guess, unfortunately, that this war will continue.\nReprinted with author’s permission from\nThe Knoxville Focus.\nJohn James Duncan Jr. is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for Tennessee’s 2nd congressional district from 1988 to 2019.

    "title": "Czech President Pledges 800K Shells to Ukraine, Boosting Defense Amid Crisis",
    "text": "Amidst ongoing tensions and the dire need for military support in Ukraine, Czech President Petr Pavel has made a significant announcement that could alter the landscape of the conflict. The promise of delivering 800 thousand artillery shells to Ukraine in the coming weeks marks a pivotal moment in international military aid efforts. This development, contingent on the absence of \"fundamental problems,\" has been met with anticipation and speculation regarding the potential impact on the war-torn region.\nAdvertisment Unprecedented Military Aid The announcement by President Petr Pavel not only underscores the Czech Republic's support for Ukraine but also highlights a broader coalition of countries willing to assist in the conflict. While the exact nations involved in supplying the shells have not been disclosed, experts speculate that they could include non-opposing states such as South Korea, South Africa, and Turkey. This move represents one of the most significant direct military aids to Ukraine, potentially surpassing the efforts made by the European Union thus far. The delivery of such a vast quantity of ammunition could significantly bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities, enabling them to save tens of thousands of lives.\nStrategic Implications and Challenges Advertisment The logistics of transporting 800 thousand artillery shells pose considerable challenges, from securing safe passage to ensuring timely delivery. However, the strategic implications of this aid cannot be understated. Enhancing Ukraine's military arsenal with such a substantial influx of ammunition could shift the dynamics of the conflict, potentially leading to a change in tactics and morale on the ground. Moreover, this aid package signals a robust international stance against aggression, reinforcing the global commitment to upholding sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nLooking Ahead: Impact and Expectations As the international community watches closely, the successful delivery of these shells to Ukraine could serve as a precedent for future military aid initiatives. It raises questions about the ongoing conflict's trajectory and the potential for further escalation or resolution. This bold step by the Czech Republic, coupled with the support of other contributing nations, may inspire additional support and solidarity with Ukraine, altering the course of the conflict. The coming weeks will be critical in determining the effectiveness of this aid and its implications for the broader geopolitical landscape.\nThe announcement by Czech President Petr Pavel has introduced a new chapter in the narrative of international support for Ukraine. As the world awaits the delivery of the promised artillery shells, the implications of this aid extend beyond the immediate military benefits. It symbolizes a collective endeavor to confront aggression, protect sovereignty, and preserve human lives amidst one of the most challenging conflicts of our time. The coming weeks may well define the future course of the Ukrainian conflict and the international community's role in shaping its outcome.",

    "title": "Sudan: Rapid Support Forces' horrific and widespread use of sexual violence leaves lives in tatters",
    "text": "This press release contains descriptions of sexual violence and torture.\nThe Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has inflicted widespread sexual violence on women and girls throughout Sudan’s two-year civil war to humiliate, assert control and displace communities across the country. The RSF’s atrocities, including rape, gang-rape and sexual slavery, amount to war crimes and possible crimes against humanity, Amnesty International said in a new report.\nThe report, They raped all of us: Sexual violence against women and girls in Sudan, documents RSF soldiers raping or gang-raping 36 women and girls as young as 15, plus other forms of sexual violence, in four Sudanese states between April 2023 and October 2024. Violations include raping a mother after tearing away her breastfeeding baby and the 30-day sexual enslavement of a woman in Khartoum, as well as severe beatings, torture with hot liquid or sharp blades, and murder.\n“The RSF’s assaults on Sudanese women and girls are sickening, depraved and aimed at inflicting maximum humiliation. The RSF has targeted civilians, particularly women and girls, with unimaginable cruelty during this war,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International Senior Director for Regional Human Rights Impact. “The world must act to stop the RSF’s atrocities by stemming the flow of weapons into Sudan, pressuring the leadership to end sexual violence, and holding perpetrators including top commanders to account.”\n“The RSF’s assaults on Sudanese women and girls are sickening, depraved and aimed at inflicting maximum humiliation.\nDeprose Muchena, Amnesty International Senior Director for Regional Human Rights Impact\nSudan’s civil war erupted in April 2023 between the RSF and Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), killing tens of thousands of people and displacing more than 11 million to date. Both sides have committed serious violations of international humanitarian law, some of which amount to war crimes, including sexual violence against women and girls.\nFor the report, Amnesty interviewed 30 people, mostly survivors and relatives of survivors in Ugandan refugee camps. All survivors and witnesses identified RSF fighters as perpetrators. The RSF’s use of sexual violence throughout the conflict and across Sudan, combined with the fact that many attacks took place in the presence of other soldiers, victims and other civilians, indicates perpetrators did not feel compelled to hide their crimes and did not fear any response.\nThe RSF did not respond to Amnesty’s requests for comment.\n‘The most horrific day in my life’\nEvery survivor of sexual violence who was interviewed described how the attack caused massive physical or mental harm, and had devastating impacts on their families. All fled their homes after.\nIn Nyala, South Darfur, RSF soldiers tied a woman to a tree before one raped her as the others watched. “It was the most horrific day in my life,” she said.\nIn Madani, Gezira, three RSF soldiers gang-raped a woman in front of her 12-year-old daughter and sister-in-law. “It was so humiliating,” the woman said. “I feel broken.”\nThe RSF’s attacks on civilians are shameful and cowardly, and any countries supporting the RSF, including by supplying them with weapons, shares in their shame.\nDeprose Muchena, Amnesty International Senior Director for Regional Human Rights Impact\nNumerous survivors said RSF soldiers raped them on suspicion of SAF affiliation. Female medical workers said RSF troops raped them if they could not save wounded soldiers. In one such case, a nurse said 13 soldiers abducted her in Khartoum North and forced her to treat severely injured men before gang-raping her, leaving her unconscious.\nAmnesty found two cases of sexual slavery in Khartoum, including a woman who said RSF troops held her captive in a house for a month, raping her almost daily.\nSurvivors said anyone who resisted rape risked beatings, torture and other ill-treatment, or murder, including an 11-year-old boy who an RSF soldier beat to death as he tried to help his mother.\n“The horror of the RSF’s sexual violence is overwhelming, but the cases documented among refugees represent a small fraction of the violations the RSF has likely committed,” said Deprose Muchena. “The RSF’s attacks on civilians are shameful and cowardly, and any countries supporting the RSF, including by supplying them with weapons, shares in their shame.”\nA ‘reprehensible’ response\nThe world’s response has likewise been shameful as victims and survivors lack both health care and justice.\nNo survivors accessed timely post-rape care or reported attacks to Sudanese authorities due to ongoing fighting or fear of stigma and reprisals. Some suffer kidney pains, irregular periods, walking difficulties or long-term psychological trauma. Children who saw relatives raped suffer nightmares.\nAs refugees, all survivors said their priority was to get medical treatment for injuries and diseases inflicted by the RSF or for health conditions developed in their captivity. However, cuts to vital USAID-funded programmes have diminished prospects for accessing comprehensive sexual health care.\n“The international response to the suffering of Sudanese women and girls has been reprehensible,”\nDeprose Muchena, Amnesty International Senior Director for Regional Human Rights Impact\nSurvivors also demanded justice and accountability. One woman raped in Omdurman said: “Women are not leading or participating in this war, but it is women who are suffering the most. I want the whole world to know about the suffering of Sudanese women and girls and ensure that all the bad men who raped us are punished.”\n“The international response to the suffering of Sudanese women and girls has been reprehensible,” said Deprose Muchena. “The world has failed to protect civilians, provide sufficient humanitarian aid or hold perpetrators accountable for these crimes. It’s time for people and governments around the world to establish the truth of what has happened in Sudan, bring suspected perpetrators to justice and provide reparations and comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care to survivors.”",

    "title": "Comment on Is There Something Dark Lurking? 14 Signs To Identify A Negative Spirit Attachment by Heather Raybould",
    "text": "Do you know what is a negative spirit attachment? In the spirit of Halloween 2023, let’s discuss about the eerie topic of spirit possession and how to safeguard yourself.\nAlthough even the thought of a negative spirit or entity attached to you can be scary, you must familiarize yourself with the signs of a negative entity attachment to protect yourself and your loved ones.\nA negative spirit attachment is an “intelligent” disembodied human spirit that has attached itself to a living person’s energy field, aka aura.\nSuch spirits refuse to surrender to the death experience and want to continue certain behaviors they practiced in life. They will search for a vulnerable human candidate so they can attach and “live” vicariously through that person.\nSpirit attachments are sneaky and hardly ever detected. Attached spirits are usually never seen nor physically felt or heard. This is why it’s hard for people to believe they have a spirit attachment until things get really unbearable.\nA negative spirit attachment can happen in early childhood. When the child grows up, there may be a nagging awareness that something is not right. As adults, they don’t understand why they repeat certain harmful behaviors or addictions.\nAre you curious to know about the signs of negative spirit attachments?\nRelated:\nHow Negative Energy Affects Your Life and How to Clear It\nHow to tell if a spirit is attached to you? 14 negative spirit attachment signs\nHere we discuss the signs that indicate a spirit is attached to you and the steps you should take in such a case:\n1. Awareness\nThere might be a feeling that something is off. The behavior seems to be unusual or even obsessive. One’s outlook on life may turn somewhat bleak, and possibly\ndepression has crept in or been present for many years.\nThe following is a list of physical and mental signs of spirit attachment.\nThe indications of a negative spirit attached to you might be an ongoing thing, or there was a sudden and inexplicable onset:\n- Feeling chronically tired and depleted of energy\n- Suffering mood swings and/or impulsive behavior\n- Unexplained bursts of anger, sadness, or emotion\n- Hearing inner voices telling you things or making negative comments\n- A feeling that ‘this isn’t me’\n- Problems with addictions of all kinds\n- Poor memory, inability to focus, or confusion more than is normal\n- Sudden onset of anxiety or depression or panic attacks\n- All of a sudden pets are wary of you or shy away — sometimes growling\n- Sudden onset of physical problems with no apparent cause –especially around the upper back and neck\n- Unexplained fears and\nphobias\n- Disturbing nightmares or strange faces in dreams\n- Feelings of being watched or unexplained sensations such as a distortion of space and time\n- Feelings of unease, cold areas in your home or office, or a sense of another presence when nobody else is around\nRelated:\nHow To Recognize An Angel In Human Form\n2. Assessment\nThere needs to be an honest assessment of one’s energy field and physical self to determine whether there are signs of negative spirits around you.\nIf you or someone else suspects there is a negative spirit attachment present or there are signs of negative energy, decisive action has to be taken. You are in a dire need of a spirit release.\n3. Detection\nThere are many ways to detect a negative spirit attachment. This can be done through:\n- past life regression therapy\n- doing aura scanning\n- journaling\n- automatic writing\n- looking at the aura in a mirror\n- using a pendulum\n- muscle testing\n- examining dreams\n- special meditations.\nThere are even Theta-level\nBinaural Beat meditations that can help with diagnosing as well as spirit attachment removal.\nRelated:\nWhy Having a Dog or Cat Has a Deep Spiritual Meaning\n4. Identifying What Kind Of Attachment Is Present\nTo release spirit attachments, one has to identify the specific type of attachment. There are many different kinds of spirit attachments that have been witnessed all over the world.\n- There might be a soul of a deceased human being who has latched on to you to fulfill their unmet desires.\n- You can also be carrying a spirit from a past life who has not been able to let go of your connection.\n- You might have also unknowingly invited or invoked a dark or malicious spirit.\n5. Releasing Of Attachment\nThis stage involves a careful therapeutic release of the spirit attachment. For some, the attachment has been with them for so long, they are almost afraid to let it go.\nThere is a fear of loss expressed by the victim that seems unreasonable to others. But, I assure you, the attachment has done the victim harm and they should be gently convinced to let it go.\nRelated:\nA Glass Of Salt Water And Vinegar Will Detect Negative Energies In Your Home\nIn cases like this, multiple sessions for the release of spirit attachment might be the best course of action.\nYou need to work with an experienced Shaman or a spiritual healer who can help you identify the kind of attachment and guide you through the stages of a negative spirit attachment.\nComment down below and don’t hesitate to share all your paranormal encounters during the upcoming Halloween 2023 Season!\nRelated:\nWhat Is Spirituality?\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow to remove a negative spirit attachment?\nA negative spirit attachment can be removed through various ways, such as shamanic healing, past life regression, aura cleansing, and more, under the supervision of a healer or shaman.\nWhat are the types of entities?\nThere are several types of spiritual entities, including angels, demons, earth-bound human souls, and animal spirits, who live in different dimensions.\nWhy do evil spirits feed on negativity?\nNegativity brings your vibrations down and weakens your aura or energy field. This gives the evil spirits a chance to latch on to you like a parasite and draw your life force, as you have comparatively less resistance.",
