    "title": "Wet and wild weekend in store with hail, lightning and thunder possible – The Irish Times",
    "text": "It will be a wet and wild weekend, with hail, lightning and thunder possible across the country, according to the national forecaster. Met Éireann said there will be showers on Friday, which will mainly affect western and northern areas at first, but will spread across the country during the day. Some of the showers will be heavy with hail and the slight chance of lightning. The cold and windy weather will continue on Friday night, when there will be a mix of clear spells and showers. [Friday’s top stories: 100 ESB staff receive €200,000 severance; security alert at Israeli embassy in Dublin ](/ireland/2024/03/22/fridays-top-stories-100-esb-staff-receive-2 -severance-security-alert-at-israeli-embassy-in-dublin/) Some of the showers will be heavy and prolonged with hail and thunder possible. Some wintry falls are also possible, mainly over hills. Lowest temperatures will be between 1 and 4 degrees in fresh to strong westerly winds. A touch of frost is likely in some sheltered spots. The chance of hail and thunder will continue on Saturday, as well as the possibility of wintry falls in the morning on high ground. Looking ahead, Met Éireann said it will be unsettled and rather cool for the time of year. Sunday will start out dry in most areas with just the odd shower. However, rain will develop in the southwest during the morning, spreading across Connacht, Munster and south Leinster by afternoon. Rain will then extend nationwide in the evening. Highest afternoon temperatures will be between 8 and 11 degrees. There will be widespread outbreaks of rain on Sunday night with some heavy falls. This pattern of cloud and wet weather looks set to continue on Monday with outbreaks of rain. There is the possibility of some heavy falls, with the chance of some spot flooding. Tuesday is expected to bring a good deal of dry weather overall but there will be some showers, especially over the northern half of the country. - Listen to our [Inside Politics Podcast](https://www.irishtimes.com/podcasts/inside-politics/)for the latest analysis and chat - Sign up for [push alerts](https://www.irishtimes.com/media/2023/11/07/stay-informed-with-push-alerts-from-the-irish-times-delivered-straight-to-your-phone/)and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone - Find [The Irish Times on WhatsApp](https://www.irishtimes.com/media/2023/10/27/find-the-irish-times-on-whatsapp-and-stay-up-to-date/)and stay up to date",

    "text": "Summer may be winding down, but there’s still time to hit the beach! Just make sure you visit an open one. These 62 beaches across Massachusetts are closed, mostly due to bacteria concerns. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health says bacteria levels tend to rise right after periods of heavy rainfall. Dirty runoff from the streets gathers excrement and other harmful bacteria in the sewers, which in turn can run into nearby bodies of water. Swimming in unsafe water can potentially lead to a bevy of health problems. The most frequent and notable effects are gastrointestinal symptoms, like nausea and diarrhea. When ingested, bacteria can also cause flu-like symptoms, skin rashes, and eye-nose-throat problems. It is unclear when the beaches will reopen. Water testing results take 24 hours, DPH says, so results typically come out the next day. For now, the department warns beachgoers to be vigilant and check their interactive beach water quality dashboard . Beaches with an * indicate beaches that were closed for over a week. Two asterisks (**) indicate the beach has been closed for more than two weeks.

    "text": "A New Yorker shared the moment an Air Tag helped her retrieve her stolen wallet, after tracing the location to a surprising public place.\nKate, @kaytuh, was forced to track down her wallet at the start of the month after she alleges it was stolen on a New York subway.\nThanks to her clever forethinking to hide an Air Tag in it though, she managed to successfully find the wallet. It wasn’t without a fear-inducing retrieval method that she filmed and shared online.\nThe New Yorker used an AirTag to retrieve her stolen wallet\n“POV: Your wallet gets stolen on the subway but you had an AirTag in it,” Kate captioned the video, posted to TikTok on December 3rd.\nKate could be seen with her friends in the street, huddling around a public garbage bin. She removed her jacket, explaining that she could hear the AirTag ringing from inside of the full bin.\nShe bravely reached inside, grabbing at bags of rubbish while using her phone’s light as a guide. “I hate my life,” she told her friends.\nThe group added that they could still hear the noise before finding an object at the bottom of the bin, wrapped in toilet paper. The noise appeared to be coming from inside of it so Kate had no choice but to lean right in and retrieve it, despite the unknown liquids surrounding it.\n“Moment of truth,” a confused Kate said while unwrapping the object. “I need to cleanse my entire body.”\nAfter unwrapping the object, Kate found her wallet with the AirTag inside. Unfortunately, all the cash had been taken out but her license was still inside.\nTikTok praised Kate’s forward-thinking\nAfter gaining over 600,000 views on TikTok, viewers were impressed by the New Yorker’s ability to plan ahead by putting an AirTag in the walle.\n“Well, I think everyone is putting an AirTag in there wallet now. That’s awesome,” wrote one user.\n“I’m not easily influenced, but I did just myself an AirTag for mine and my husband’s wallets,” added another.\n“We could all only hope to be as smart as her,” joked a viewer in a comment.\nThe highs and lows of AirTags\nAirTags were introduced by\nApple in 2021 and have come in handy for those like TikToker Kate who find themselves needing to track down items.\nAt other points though, the AirTags have become a safety concern for their apparent danger when used in cases of harassment or stalking. As they’re only small, it’s easy for criminals to slip them into clothing or under cars and ultimately follow the moves of people.\nApple has however fought against this and now sends notifications to both Android and iPhone users if an AirTag is in close proximity for a notable period of time, without the iPhone it’s connected to.",

    "title": "‘A tired old political stump tactic’: Republicans of color dismayed by Haley - POLITICO",
    "text": "Among other points of frustration is the sense that the GOP candidates still can’t seem to talk about the horrors of slavery. Republicans of color said on Thursday they were dismayed by Nikki Haley’s initial refusal to say that slavery was the cause of the Civil War. It wasn’t just an offensive historical omission, they argued, but a tactical blunder too. “She easily could’ve communicated better in that moment, but chose to use a tired old political stump tactic by tossing the same question back to the guy who asked,” said Rina Shah, a Republican strategist based in Washington, D.C., in a text to POLITICO. “What I do see is her having left out the word ‘slavery’ because she was scared to talk about anything regarding our nation’s complicated history. I think by acknowledging slavery she felt she might be alienating” Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis voters. Haley, who is currently running in second among GOP primary voters in both New Hampshire and South Carolina, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average , declined on Wednesday night to say slavery was the cause of America’s deadliest war. The next morning, she attempted to clarify her statement during an interview with The Pulse of NH . “I mean of course, the Civil War was about slavery,” said the former South Carolina governor. “We know that, that’s the easy part.” She also claimed that the questioner during the town hall was a “Democratic plant.” Black Republicans like Shermichael Singleton, who has worked on previous Republican presidential campaigns including Mitt Romney and Ben Carson, remained disenchanted. Singleton said he believed Haley was right that her questioner was a plant. But he didn’t think that was an excuse for fumbling the answer. “She should’ve been able to answer the damn question and move on,” he said. He added that her comments likely alienated moderate Republicans and swing voters she desperately needed to mount a successful challenge for the nomination. “She had a chance to be competitive even though she was always likely to lose [the nomination]. However, that’s over now. She’s toast,” Singleton said. Not all Republicans of color who spoke to POLITICO thought the moment would trip up Haley’s campaign. Though arguing that she could have been more nuanced in her answer, conservative talk show host Armstrong Williams called the episode a teachable moment. “There were so many other issues that caused the Civil War, whether it be states’ rights, the role of our federal government at the time, … the economy [Americans at that time] felt was in shambles,” Williams said. “But what she has to realize is all these issues, no matter what they were, were inextricably bound to the institution of slavery. She cannot separate slavery from any of these issues no matter how many she mentions.” But, Williams added, he didn’t think the episode would torpedo her campaign. “No, nor should it,” Williams said. “Listen, Nikki Haley is not a racist. She’s not a bigot. She’s a politician,” he said. “And sometimes politicians do what politicians do and they pay the price for it. And she’s paid the price for not being the person of courage and having the moral clarity to speak the truth.” For Republicans of color, the Haley maelstrom was frustrating in part because she’s not the first GOP candidate who has been tripped up by the issue of slavery. In August, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis found himself in the crosshairs of fellow Republicans of color after his state issued revised guidelines requiring teachers to instruct some school-age children that “slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.” Among others, Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), took issue with the instructions, saying the personal benefit characterization was “wrong and needs to be adjusted.” The DeSantis camp dug in, saying Donalds, who is Black, was parroting talking points of Vice President Kamala Harris. It led to a slew of Black Republicans coming to Donalds’ defense and openly questioning the viability of the DeSantis campaign. DeSantis’ campaign was one of several that piled on Haley after her remarks, with the Florida governor calling her response “incomprehensible word salad.” Still, it is unclear how big an impact it will have with voters in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Some Republicans said a stumble like this, with just 18 days before the Iowa Caucus, is something Haley could ill afford. “Why Nikki Haley felt the need to sidestep a question that should’ve been a lay up is beyond me,” said Gen Z GOP activist CJ Pearson. He pointed to a common pushback by conservatives: that southern Democrats were defenders of the institution of slavery before splintering off from their party brethren. “We are the party of Lincoln, the party of abolition. We should stand on that, unapologetically and unequivocally,” said Pearson. And as for blunting her momentum, he added that the Haley camp had cause to be concerned. “I will say that a lot of independent voters who have rallied behind her probably woke up with a lot more pause this morning about her candidacy than they went to sleep with.”",

    "text": "[Business](https://bigthink.com/business/)— The AI manifesto of a Silicon Valley legend - Main Story: Vinod Khosla, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, examines the implications of AI in a new long-form manifesto. - Khosla attempts to contextualize the hype — and fear — that surrounds AI. - Also among this week’s stories: Alix Pasquet’s “strategic reading,” nostalgia, Tesla’s Robotaxi, and the resilience of Leonard Cohen. [Eric Markowitz](https://www.nightviewcapital.com/team/eric-markowitz/)of [Nightview Capital](https://nightviewcapital.com/). You can get articles like this one straight to your inbox every Friday evening by subscribing above. Follow him on X: [@EricMarkowitz](https://x.com/ericmarkowitz). Vinod Khosla has seen dozens of technology disruptions over his 40+ year career as a technology founder and investor. But AI, argues, is different. “I’ve seen technology reshape our world repeatedly,” Khosla — the billionaire co-founder of Sun Microsystems — writes in [a recent long-form manifesto on AI](https://www.khoslaventures.com/ai-dystopia-or-utopia/#01). “Artificial intelligence is different… AI amplifies and multiplies the human brain, much like steam engines once amplified muscle power.” What I appreciate about the piece is his attempt to contextualize the hype — and fear — that surrounds AI. And beyond simply conveying the profound social and economic changes ahead, his primary motivation in writing the piece, he says, is to “dispel the dystopian vision of an AI-first world.” He continues: Key quote: “First and foremost, it is a cognitively lazy vision — easy to fall into and lacking all imagination: large-scale job losses, the rich getting richer, the devaluation of intellectual expertise as well as physical work, and the loss of human creativity all in service of our AI overlords. On the contrary, AI can provide near free AI tutors to every child on the planet and near free AI physician expertise to everyone on the planet. Virtually every kind of expertise will be near free from oncologists to structural engineers, software engineers to product designers and chip designers and scientists all fall into this camp. It will also help control plasma in fusion reactors and self-flying aircraft, self-driving cars and public transit making all substantially more affordable and accessible by all.” Get an investment edge through “strategic reading” Alix Pasquet — a former professional backgammon player turned hedge fund manager — [published a smart presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VZYYEkq_0s) this week on what he calls “strategic reading.” The decline of reading books has become a problem, he says. But it’s also creating an opportunity for people that don’t just read excessively — but read strategically in choosing what (and how) to read things. Reading, Alix says, also creates leverage: it can improve your network, it can make you money, and perhaps most importantly, it teaches you how to communicate. “Remember,” he says, “it’s those that communicate well that are given positions of responsibility.” Key quote: “Young people today don’t read as much, which is becoming a problem. It used to be standard to read widely, but now it’s actually a competitive advantage — because fewer people do it. Reading plays a crucial role in investing because investing is an intellectual capital business, and that capital is found in books. Reading also stimulates your imagination and visualization skills, which are essential when evaluating investments. You’ll find that great investors visualize ideas as they’re being pitched, mentally replaying scenarios based on their experience.” A few more links I enjoyed: [A Message From the Past (Thoughts on Nostalgia)](https://collabfund.com/blog/a-message-from-the-past-thoughts-on-nostalgia/) – via Morgan Housel Key quote: “There’s a Russian saying about nostalgia: ‘The past is more unpredictable than the future.’ It’s so common for people’s memories about a time to become disconnected from how they actually felt at the time. I have a theory for why this happens: When studying history, you know how the story ends, which makes it impossible to imagine what people were thinking or feeling in the past.” [A Primer on AI Data Centers](https://substack.com/home/post/p-149974838) – via Eric Flaningam Key quote: “We’re currently in the midst of one of the largest computing infrastructure buildouts in history. 100+ years ago, we saw a similar buildout of the electric grid (which ironically is a bottleneck for today’s buildout). Throughout the birth of the electric grid, we saw the scaling of power plants (building power plants as large as possible to capture performance improvements), ‘Astronomical’ CapEx investments, and the plummeting cost of electricity.” [Field Report: 5 Takeaways from We, Robot](https://www.nightviewcapital.com/field-report-5-takeaways-from-we-robot/) – via Dan Crowley, CFA Key quote: “Most investors had an immediate, gut reaction to last week’s Tesla’s Robotaxi event, and I understand why. I was there — it was a spectacle… My takeaway: seeing Optimus up close was not just impressive, it was transformative. It felt natural, even intuitive, to be around these humanoid robots, and it became clear to me that we are no longer talking about some distant, sci-fi dream. I believe the foundation for massive demand is being laid, and while it will take time, the end destination seems inevitable.” [Hallelujah: Leonard Cohen’s Blessings in Disguise](https://alchemy.substack.com/p/hallelujah-leonard-cohens-blessings) – via Frederik Gieschen Key quote: “Leonard Cohen didn’t record his first album until he was thirty-three. It was 1967 and by the standards of the hippie era (“Don’t trust anyone over 30”), he was late to the game. “A thirty-two-year-old poet? Are you crazy?” one record label executive said when Cohen was signed. I just finished the Cohen biography I’m Your Man and a heartwarming documentary about the origins of “Hallelujah,” his best-known song (famously covered by Jeff Buckley and many others). I was struck by a particular aspect of Cohen’s story: his resilience.” [Test Your Network](https://newsletter.theleading-edge.org/p/test-your-network) – via Tom Morgan Key quote: “The quality of your network is defined by size and time. Dunbar’s Number is the robustly-proven finding that the optimal human group size is somewhere around 150 people, but the typical network is far from evenly-distributed. Perhaps less well-known is that Dunbar believed your network scaled from an intimate circle of 5, followed by successive layers in rough multiples of three: 15 (good friends), 50 (friends), 150 (meaningful contacts), 500 (acquaintances) and 1,500 (people you can recognize). Recent research confirms that this relationship has held surprisingly constant, even now many of our friendships have been digitized.” From the archives: [Joel Greenblatt: Investing Made Simple](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/joel-greenblatt/) – via The Knowledge Project (2021) Key quote: “There are a lot of smart people out there, a lot smarter than me. But if you look at things from 40,000 feet or a different angle — that’s where I have tended to have my most success. I just realized ‘Yes, everyone is looking at it this way, but I think that’s not the right way to look at it.’ When you recognize that you have this other way to look, and that makes total sense to you and all the pieces fit when you look at it that way, I think those are the great opportunities.”",

En este sentido, precisó que la mayoría están en Potosí, La Paz y Cochabamba.\nCalvimontes remarcó que los principales ríos, como el de Piraí en Santa Cruz ha llegado a su nivel normal de agua; es decir, cualquier incremento puede derivar en desbordes. \"Lo que tenemos que hacer aquí es alertar a la población que vive cerca a los ríos que deben tener la precaución necesaria para evitar daños\", remarcó.\nEl 26 de diciembre, el Senamhi advirtió posibles desbordes de ríos ante incremento de los niveles del agua de los ríos. La alerta está vigente hasta el 29 de diciembre de 2023.\nEn La Paz, Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, Pando, Chuquisaca, Beni, Tarija y Potosí rige una alerta de prioridad naranja por riesgo de desborde de ríos.\nAnte esta situación, Calvimontes pidió a las autoridades regionales tomar las precauciones necesarias para \"evitar cualquier desastre\", porque las lluvias son impredecibles y en algunos lugares son \"intensas\".",
