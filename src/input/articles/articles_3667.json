    "title": "JNU wall sprayed with 'Rebuild Babri Masjid' message ahead of mega Ram Temple consecration in January",
    "text": "The walls of Jawaharlal Nehru University were sprayed with messages calling for reconstruction of Babri Masjid ahead of mega Ram Temple consecration ceremony scheduled in January 22.\nPhotos of the graffiti were discovered by students on Wednesday night. Graffiti was sprayed on the first floor of School of Language and the message read 'Rebuild Babri Masjid 6 December'. 'NSUI' (National Students' Union of India), was also mentioned below.\nAs the seemingly NSUI attribution sparked controversy, the student body denied any involvement in the act and stated that the message is part of a conspiracy to defame both the campus and NSUI.\nJNU unit president Sudhanshu Shekhar said that the NSUI's name was already present in black marker and that the slogans were added above it later in red marker, The Times of India reported .\nThe student body called for stringent action against those involved in the act after an investigation.\nNaveen Yadav, the chief security officer of JNU, claimed to have no knowledge of the incident. He mentioned that a few months ago, there were also slogans written targeting a specific caste, but no investigation was conducted at that time.\nIn October this year, a similar incident took place where messages such as \"Free Kashmir,\" \"Teri Kabra Khudegi\" (Grave of yours will be dug), and \"Bhagwa Jalega\" were sprayed on the walls of a building within the university.\nSlogans like \"There will be blood\" were also sprayed on the walls of the School of Languages and School of International Studies at the university earlier.\nSatish Garkoti, rector of JNU, had said in October that a committee would look into repeated incidents of \"anti-national\" slogans on its campus. He had further stated that the committee was collaborating with the deans of various schools to gradually install CCTV cameras in strategic areas.\nHowever, it was said that it was not feasible to have CCTV cameras installed throughout the entire campus at once.\nADVERTISEMENT (Published 29 December 2023, 09:25 IST)",

    "text": "(CNN) — A Florida priest is accused of biting a woman while giving out Communion during a Mass in St. Cloud in an alleged “attempt to defend the Communion bread,” according to the charging affidavit in the case.\nThe priest, identified as Father Fidel Rodriguez, initially refused to give the woman Communion bread on May 19 and told her “she did not do the prior steps necessary” to receive the bread when he encountered her at a Mass held earlier that day at St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church, according to police.\nA statement provided by the Diocese of Orlando states Rodriguez gave the woman a blessing at the 10 a.m. Mass and “advised her to receive the Sacrament of Penance (Confession) before coming back to receive Holy Communion (Eucharist).”\nThe woman told police she returned to the church for the noon Mass and informed the priest she had in fact done the necessary steps and “is now accepted by God, thus, granting her the ability to participate in communion,” the affidavit states.\nThe priest asked the woman if she “had been to the Sacrament of Penance (Confession), to which she stated it was not his business,” according to the statement from the Diocese.\nThe woman told police Rodriguez allegedly “became upset and tried to ram the ‘cookie’ in her mouth,” according to the affidavit. She said she then attempted to grab another Communion bread, which the priest was holding, when he grabbed and bit her arm, the affidavit states.\n“Father Rodriguez offered the woman Holy Communion on the tongue. At that point, the woman forcefully placed her hand in the vessel and grabbed some sacred Communion hosts, crushing them,” according to the Diocese’s statement on the incident.\n“Having only one hand free, Father Rodriguez struggled to restrain the woman as she refused to let go of the hosts. When the woman pushed him and reacting to a perceived act of aggression, Father Rodriguez bit her hand so she would let go of the hosts she grabbed,” the statement continued.\nThe woman was asked to leave, according to the Diocese, which added the priest had not met her before.\nWhen interviewed by police, the priest told the investigating officer the woman had pushed him and “would not let go of the communion tray and the only way he thought to extract her from it was to bite her arm,” according to the affidavit.\n“In the Catholic Tradition, the Eucharist is considered ‘the source and summit’ of worship and faith. The act of participation in Holy Communion therefore calls for a proper understanding, reverence, and devotion,” the statement from the Diocese reads.\n“It is not something a person can arbitrarily demand and is certainly not a mere ‘cookie’ as the complainant called it,” the statement adds.\nThe woman refused medical attention and police photographed the bite mark, according to the affidavit.\nSt. Cloud Police have forwarded the affidavit summary of events to the State Attorney’s Office for review.\nThe Ninth Judicial Circuit State Attorney’s Office told CNN in a statement on Friday, “We have received the case and it is currently under review to determine the appropriate course of action.”\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The show will return in 2026, according to organizer Marketplace Events. Marketplace Events (MPE) tried to find another venue for the show but could not due to its space and logistical needs. “After an extensive search, we ultimately determined that alternate venue options did not provide adequate space nor dates suitable for us to run a two-weekend show” said Marketplace Events Vice Chairman Tom Baugh in a news release. “This led to our decision to wait until we could produce the high-quality show the Greater Cincinnati community knows and expects. We look forward to hosting a wonderful show in 2026.” MPE’s other local show, the Greater Cincinnati Holiday Market, will be held this year at the Sharonville Convention Center",

    "title": "Indian Online Visa Simplifying Travel For Luxembourg, Bolivia, Albania, Mexico and Chile Citizens",
    "text": "India Online Visa is pleased to announce the extension of its online visa program to people of Luxembourg, Chile, Albania, Mexico, and Bolivia in an endeavor to enhance travel and cultural exchange. With this project, we hope to strengthen our international ties and highlight the enriching experiences that travelers from around the world can have in India. Citizens of these nations can now access the Indian online visa system, which simplifies the application process for a variety of visa categories. Those looking to see the varied landscapes, rich cultural legacy, and historical riches of India will have an easier time getting their visas.\nINDIAN VISA FOR LUXEMBOURG CITIZENS\nSince 2014, the availability of the Indian Visa in electronic mode has been extended to Luxembourg nationals. The India e-Visa, a government-issued document, facilitates entry and travel to India for residents and citizens of Luxembourg. Online applications are accepted from Luxembourg, simplifying the overall process. Currently, more than 169 countries are eligible to apply for an Indian e-Visa. Introduced in 2017, the visa aims to streamline the process, saving time and money for tourists.\nForeigners visiting India for pleasure, tourism, or short-term medical treatment have the option to apply for an eVisa. A Tourist visa, valid for a single entrance, allows a 30-day stay. For those desiring an extended stay in India for leisure purposes, Long-Term Tourist eVisas for 1 year and 5 years are available. These visas permit multiple entries during their validity period, with each stay limited to 90 days.\nAn e-business visa, offering multiple entries, allows a 365-day stay, with a maximum continuous stay of 180 days per visit. Medical e-visas and Physician Assistant e-visas enable three entries into India for medical treatment or accompanying family members, allowing a total stay of 60 days from the first arrival date. The application process for the online Indian e-Visa is quick, taking only a few minutes to complete.\nIndian Visa Requirements for citizens of Luxembourg\n- A valid Passport that is valid for 6 months\n- A valid Email address to receive the e-visa in their Inbox.\n- They can use a Credit/Debit Card or PayPal Account to pay for the e-visa fees.\nINDIAN VISA FOR CHILE CITIZENS\nIn 2015, alterations to the visa procedure by the Indian government resulted in the extension of online travel authorization to 169 nations, including Chile. This modification allowed citizens of Chile to efficiently apply for electronic visas. Before entering India, individuals are required to present a valid passport and a visa as proof of identity. Since 2014, an online application form for Indian visas has been made accessible to Chileans.\nChilean citizens now have a quicker and more convenient process for applying for a travel permit to India. There are three types of e-Visas available to Chileans: the e-Tourist Visa, the e-Business Visa, and the e-Medical Visa. The Tourist visa is suitable for those intending to visit India for tourism purposes, allowing a vacation, family reunion, sightseeing, or retreat for up to 90 days. The E-Business Visa caters to individuals with business-related visits, offering a stay of up to 180 days for attending meetings, initiating business ventures, hiring staff, or delivering lectures. The e-Medical Visa is designed for travelers seeking medical treatment in India, providing a maximum stay of 60 days and allowing a total of three visits.\nBefore completing the visa application, applicants should verify the specific Indian visa requirements applicable to Chilean citizens. The convenience of online applications eliminates the need for Chilean citizens to schedule an appointment with the Indian Embassy for a Tourist Visa. The entire application process, including fee payment and document submission, can be efficiently completed online, ensuring a faster and more convenient experience.\nIndian Visa Requirements for Citizens of Chile\n- A valid passport and a complete scan of the information page.\n- A digital passport photo.\n- A valid email address to receive the eVisa in their Inbox.\n- They can use a credit/debit card or PayPal account to pay for their visa fees.\nINDIAN VISA FOR ALBANIA CITIZENS\nAlbanians, in addition to undertaking pilgrimages, plan vacations to India, benefiting from the friendly relations maintained between Albania and India. The Indian authorities mandate obtaining a visa before visiting the country. However, obtaining an Indian visa has become more accessible for Albanians since 2014. The Indian government introduced an online application form for Indian visas specifically designed for Albanian citizens, streamlining the process.\nThe online document, akin to a paper visa, grants entry into the country. Notably, unlike a traditional paper visa, this online process eliminates the need to visit the embassy in person. In 2015, the Indian government revamped its visa process, extending online travel authorization to 169 countries, including Albania, thereby facilitating e-visa applications for Albanian citizens.\nAlbanian citizens now have the option to apply for three distinct types of India e-Visas: the e-Tourist Visa, the e-Business Visa, or the e-Medical Visa. The Tourist e-Visa, valid for 30 days with a double entry, cannot be extended or converted. For longer stays, Albanian citizens may opt for a 1-year or 5-year Tourist e-visa, allowing multiple entries with a maximum stay of 1 year or 5 years, provided each stay does not exceed 90 days.\nThe E-Business Visa, valid for 365 days from the date of Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) issuance, permits a stay of 365 days, with multiple entry options available. The Electronic Medical Visa is issued to Albanian citizens requiring medical treatment in India, allowing three entries and a maximum stay of 60 days from the date of arrival.\nPreviously requiring a visit to the Indian Embassy, the entire application process for these e-Visas can now be completed conveniently from home using a computer or smartphone, connected to a WiFi connection, enabling Albanians to apply for their Indian e-Visa online within minutes.\nIndian Visa Requirements for citizens of Albania\n- Citizens need a valid passport that is valid for 6 months\n- A recent photograph\n- A valid email address to receive the eVisa in their Inbox.\n- They can use PayPal or a debit/credit card so they can pay for the visa fees.\nINDIAN VISA FOR MEXICO CITIZENS\nIndia stands as one of South Asia’s premier tourist destinations, and for those traveling from Mexico, the journey has become notably simpler. Mexico is among the 169 nations whose citizens qualify for the India e-Visa, making the process of obtaining a visa for Mexico straightforward. Prospective visitors can apply for a visa online and secure approval before departing from Mexico, offering a convenient approach.\nWhile Mexico isn’t part of India’s visa waiver nations, the application for an India e-Visa is accessible for Mexican citizens. Since 2014, the Indian government has made the Indian Visa application form available online specifically for Mexican citizens. Various types of India e-Visas cater to different activities such as tourism, business travel, family visits, and short-term medical treatment.\nFor instance, the India Single Entry tourist Visa allows a stay of up to 90 days and covers activities like tourism, family visits, or stays at wellness retreats. Travelers have a one-year window after visa approval to enter India. The Double Entry eBusiness Visa is designed for those on business trips, permitting a total stay of up to 180 days. Similar to the tourist visa, business visa holders have one year to enter India upon visa approval, with the flexibility to engage in activities like attending business meetings, guided tours, or participating in business fairs or exhibitions.\nMexican citizens can also opt for an eMedical Visa to India, allowing three entries for short-term medical treatment, with a maximum stay of 60 days. The online application process for the India e-Visa is user-friendly, eliminating the need to personally visit an Indian Embassy or Consulate. The entire application and approval process can be completed efficiently in as little as two business days, thanks to the streamlined online system.\nIndian Visa Requirements for citizens of Mexico\n- Passport: take a look at the expiration date to make sure that it is valid for at least six months’ validity remaining after their expected date of arrival in India.\n- Digital photo of traveler: this photo must be as recent as possible.\n- A complete passport scan of the information page\n- Payment means: Travelers can use a debit or credit card.\n- Business card copy and invitation letter: if necessary, especially when applying for the Business eVisa.\n- Letter from the hospital in India: only if they apply for the Medical eVisa.\nINDIAN VISA FOR BOLIVIA CITIZENS\nBolivians have the opportunity to enter and travel to India for tourism, business, or medical purposes through the utilization of the official document known as the India e-Visa, issued by the Indian government. Since 2014, citizens of Bolivia have been eligible to electronically apply for an Indian visa. To facilitate a quick and easy entry into the country, individuals from Bolivia will need an e-Visa for India, an accessible digital document online. It is imperative for Bolivian nationals intending to visit India to secure approval from the Indian government, with the e-Visa, also referred to as the Indian e-Visa, being accessible to citizens of 169 different countries.\nFor those applying for an India Tourist visa, it is important to note that the visa remains valid for a year from the date of issuance, with a maximum stay of 90 days per entry following arrival. The E-Business Visa, valid for 365 days from the date of Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) issuance, allows a stay of 365 days, but continuous stays cannot exceed 180 days. Multiple entry options are available for this type of visa. Additionally, the Electronic Medical Visa is issued to Bolivian citizens requiring medical treatment in India, permitting three entries and a maximum stay of 60 days from the date of arrival.\nObtaining travel documents has been made convenient as individuals can now acquire them from the comfort of their homes or any location. The online process has significantly streamlined the visa application steps and reduced processing time.\nIndian Visa Requirements for citizens of Bolivia\n- Valid passport: must be valid for at least 6 months.\n- Digital photo: this picture must be as recent as possible.

    "text": "[Mark_Renton_1](/user/Mark_Renton_1)a [youtube.com](/go/link/3911302)\nEn sociedad, las religiones cumplen fundamentalmente dos papeles:\n- Justificar a los opresores y perdonarles sus abusos.\n- Darle una falsa esperanza a los oprimidos, o incluso tratar de compensarlos con algún bien intangible (ir al cielo, reencarnarse, etc) para que no se rebelen contra los opresores.\nLo que está claro es que las religiones no buscan acabar con las desigualdades... todo lo contrario, son un mecanismo social para perpetuar la desigualdad.\n[#1](c1#c-1) Hay una frase atribuída a Napoleón que dice \"la religión es lo que impide que los pobres maten a los reyes\"\n[#5](c5#c-5) por no olvidar dos de los mejores controladores de masas que todas tienen: LA CULPA Y EL MIEDO.\nPorque la responsabilidad y la sensatez son liberadores.\n#FreeAssange\n[#1](c1#c-1) Básicamente nacieron y son la mejor herramienta del poder para hacer al Pueblo conformista... esta vida es irrelevante porque lo importante es el premio \"eterno\".\nLos palestinos en Israel no tienen los mismos derechos que los judíos. De hecho, no se les permite tener la ciudadanía israelí si reniegan del sionismo.\nEn cuanto a sus derechos violados, hay extensa literatura de las organizaciones no gubernamentales por los derechos humanos que se refieren al estado de Israel como un apartheid (cosa que no pasa con los judíos en Irán).\nEso sin contar con el genocidio que los sionistas llevan cometiendo contra los palestinos desde la creación del estado de Israel, para así poder quedarse con sus tierras. Ahora intensificado en con el crimen de lesa humanidad que los sionistas están cometiendo contra los palestinos en Gaza. Cosa que no ha pasado ni está pasando en Irán...\n[#14](c14#c-14) Se fueron voluntariamente y ante la llamada de Israel que les daba todo tipo de ayudas económicas que no tenían en Irán.\nMientras que los palestinos han sido masacrados, sus propiedades destruidas y sus tierras se les han robado los sionistas.\n[#16](c16#c-16) Tambien dan ayudas a los judios useños y estos no se van, no en la misma cantidad que Iran.\nDe Iran se han ido, teniendo en cuenta un crecimiento de la poblacion de x4 desde 1948, el 99% de los judios.\n[#17](c17#c-17) Con eso me quieres decir que en el mundo hay más judíos sionistas que judíos no-sionistas.\nRespecto a la demografía:\nJudíos en Palestina en 1931 eran 91,398 mientras que musulmanes 759,717\nPara 1945 eran 553,600 mientras que musulmanes 1,061,270\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Palestine_(region)\nSabes si los británicos estuvieron de acuerdo con Hitler y los sionistas en el Acuerdo de Haavara\nhttps://www.lemonde.fr/en/history/article/2023/08/06/90-years-ago-a-negotiated-transfer-led-over-50-000-german-jews-to-palestine_6082440_157.html\nA lo mejor es que los iraníes no fueron tan malos como los europeos...\n[#19](c19#c-19) ???\nHe hablado de palestinos o sionistas???\nQue mania con el whataboutismo.\nLa realidad es que la gran mayoria de judios marcharon de Iran, en especial a los pocos meses de la caida del regimen del Sha. Y marcharon a Israel, USA, Suiza, ...\nPD: Y si me hablas del acuerdo de Haavara hablame tambien del Gran Mufti de Israel.\nPero no, no lo vas a hacer porque estas mas preocupado en mantener una narrativa.\n[#20](c20#c-20) Estamos hablando de inmigración a Israel y sus causas: quién lo fomentó, por qué, para qué, de dónde procedían los inmigrantes, que ideología permitía la inmigración, etc\nPara comparar los inmigrantes desde Irán y los inmigrantes desde otros puntos del planeta como por ejemplo Europa. Y así poder discernir quienes fueron obligados y masacrados, y quienes no !!!\nPero veo que tu no quieres hablar sobre ese tema en concreto, si no hacer proselitismo sobre unas ideas.\n[#22](c22#c-22) Yo he puntualizado tu afirmacion de\n\"Y, no te quiero contar lo que dicen los sionistas que harían con los judíos antisionistas que siguen viviendo en Irán (después de Israel es Irán el país que más judíos tiene en Oriente Medio)\"\ncon un\n\"Iran tenia 150,000 judios en 1948. Hoy tiene 8500. Y eso que ha habido explosion demografica.\"\nLa realidad es que la gran mayoria de judios de Iran, un 99% si calculamos el aumento de poblacion, han huido del pais.\n[#23](c23#c-23) Es que ya te he dicho que la afirmación que haces es FALSA. No han \"huido\", han emigrado porque les daban ayudas en Israel que les compensaban lo que tenían en Irán. De la misma forma que no huyeron desde Rusia o desde Estados Unidos o desde otros países donde sigue existiendo comunidades judías.\nSin embargo, los que sí huyeron de Europa, porque los estaban exterminando (como ahora exterminan los sionistas a los palestinos) fueron los que los británicos permitieron asentarse en Palestina.\n[#24](c24#c-24) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Jews\nAt the time of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, 80,000–100,000 Jews were living in Iran. From then on, Jewish emigration from Iran dramatically increased, as about 20,000 Jews left within several months of the revolution alone.[45] The majority of Iran's Jewish population, some 60,000 Jews, emigrated in the aftermath of the revolution, of whom 35,000 went to the United States, 20,000 to Israel, and 5,000 to Europe (mainly to the United Kingdom, France, Denmark, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland).\nMuchos judios se quedaron despues del 48 y se marcharon a los meses de la llegada de Jomeini en el 79. La mayoria marcharon a USA, no Israel.\nSi, creo que se puede afirmar que huyeron.\n[#2](c2#c-2) Los antisionistas son tratados inhumanamente en Israel\nhttps://fr.news.yahoo.com/video/police-crack-down-anti-zionist-032104267.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8\nY, no te quiero contar lo que dicen los sionistas que harían con los judíos antisionistas que siguen viviendo en Irán (después de Israel es Irán el país que más judíos tiene en Oriente Medio)\nhttps://aish.com/the-jews-of-iran-10-amazing-facts/\n[#27](c27#c-27) Iranian Jews remain under various discriminatory legal restrictions regarding their position in society. Jews are prohibited from holding significant governmental and decision-making positions. A Jew may not serve on the Guardian Council, as President, or as a military commander. Jews may not serve as judges, and aside from the seat reserved for a Jew in the Majlis, Jews may not become a member of the Majlis through general elections. A Jew may not inherit property from a Muslim. By law, if one member of a Jewish family converts to Islam, that person inherits all family property. Jews also do not have equal rights to Qisas, or retribution, in the Iranian judicial system. For example, if a Jew were to kill a Muslim, the family of the victim would have the right to ask that the death penalty be imposed, but if a Muslim kills a Jew, the penalty would be left to the discretion of the judges with the wishes of the victim's family carrying no legal weight.\nMe llama la atencion lo de\nif one member of a Jewish family converts to Islam, that person inherits all family property.\nYa se como heredar todo.\nJews also do not have equal rights to Qisas, or retribution, in the Iranian judicial system\nif a Muslim kills a Jew, the penalty would be left to the discretion of the judges with the wishes of the victim's family carrying no legal weight\nEso de ninguna restriccion es una afirmacion muy atrevida.\nY no tiene diputados. Tienen 1. Por ley. Otras minorias tambien tienen 1.\n[#28](c28#c-28) Ah, que ahora hay que hablar inglés, vaya con el imperio que bien se lo ha montado y que de súbditos tiene.\n[#30](c30#c-30) Es qué NO es cierto que tengan restricciones, sólo deberías de analizar lo que has escrito, y es que aunque Israel les ofreció de todo, varios miles se quedaron en un país islámico.\n[#31](c31#c-31) La situacion de los judios en Iran:\n- Si los mata un musulman el tribunal puede ignorarlo.\n- Si un miembro de la familia se convierte al Islam hereda todas las propiedades.\nAsi que no, no tienen los mismos derechos que un musulman. Ni de lejos.\nEl 99% de los judios de Iran han acabado marchando a USA, Israel y Europa. Unos 8500 continuan viviendo ahi.\nEn el año 2000 vivian unos 25.000. Ahora 8.500\nYa me he hecho una imagen clara.\n[#32](c32#c-32) A ver, de tonterías y mentiras está la falsimedia llena, te repito ¿porqué miles de judios NO se han ido a Israel?, si les ofrecian una vida mejor y con una religión propia, ¿son masoquistas qué prefieren vivir en un país que no es el suyo si según tú son discriminados?\n[#33](c33#c-33) Ya te he dado los datos basicos. Entre la wikimedia y los comentarios random de un tio en internet me quedo con la wikipedia.\nPor que hay judios en Iran y no se han marchado?\nPues no se.\nPor que hay palestinos en Israel y no se han marchado, son masocas?\nQue haya palestinos en Israel significa que su vida es maravillosa?\nNota: parece que la mayoria de los judios que quedan son viejos y solo hablan farsi.\nA lo mejor eso da una pista.\n[#34](c34#c-34) Los palestinos estan en Palestina.\nhttps://espanol.almayadeen.net/noticias/politica/1769259/jud%C3%ADos-de-ir%C3%A1n-condenan-a--israel--por-sus-cr%C3%ADmenes-contra-p\n[#35](c35#c-35) No me tomaria muy en serio lo que dicen los judios en Iran. En Iran han ejecutado a varios judios por mostrarse a favor de Israel.\nEs un fuerte incentivo para expresar lo que conviene. Que puede ser, pero a saber.\nBTW\nIn May 1998, Jewish businessman Ruhollah Kadkhodah-Zadeh was hanged in prison without a public charge or legal proceeding, apparently for assisting Jews to emigrate\nSegun ciertas fuentes ayudan a emigrar judios en Iran tambien puede llevarte a una muerte antes de tiempo.\n[#37](c37#c-37) No han ejecutado a judios por tener posiciones a favor de Israel?\nOye, simplemente he dicho que no te puedes fiar, porque no son libres de decir lo que piensan.\nEstoy seguro que sabes que Iran no es como Europa. Seguro.\nQue a lo mejor si hay alguno a favor, pero a saber.\n[#7](c7#c-7) Los israelíes en Irán no tienen los mismos derechos que en Israel. De hecho, no se les permite tener la ciudadanía israelí mientras se encuentren en territorio iraní.\nEn cuanto a sus derechos:\nLibertad de movimiento: Los israelíes en Irán tienen severas restricciones de movimiento. Se les prohíbe salir de Teherán sin autorización previa y no pueden visitar ciertas áreas del país.Religión: Se les permite practicar el judaísmo, pero con limitaciones. Las sinagogas están sujetas a vigilancia y no se permite la proselitización.Propiedad: No pueden poseer propiedades en Irán.Educación: No pueden asistir a universidades públicas.Empleo: Se les restringe el acceso a la mayoría de los trabajos.En general, los israelíes en Irán son considerados ciudadanos de segunda clase y son objeto de discriminación por parte del gobierno.\nPasaporte:\nDebido a que no se les permite tener la ciudadanía iraní, los israelíes en Irán no pueden obtener un pasaporte iraní. En cambio, deben usar un pasaporte extranjero para viajar.\nUno diría que los Iraníes tratan a los Israelíes en Irán de la misma manera que Israel trata a los Israelíes musulmanes en Israel.\nen menor medida, el futbol y la politica. hay veces que la gente busca cualquier excusa para odiarte. en meneame muchos empiezan sus respuestas atribuyendote un color politico para proceder a soltar bilis.\nLa religión es un elemento identitario más. En nuestro instinto está el de pertenecer a un grupo con el que luchar por recursos y defendernos de otros grupos.\nReligión, raza, idioma, folclore, son muchas cosas las que si bien en principio pueden no tener un impacto negativo, sí que sirven para reforzar esos vínculos y luchar contra un enemigo.\nQue no estoy en contra ni creo positivo unificar todo en una misma cultura. Pero es obvio que sirve para marcar límites definir bandos y motivar a una sociedad hacia la confrontación.",

    "text": "[Sign up for The Brief](https://www.texastribune.org/newsletters/the-brief/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=trib-ads-owned&utm_campaign=trib-marketing&utm_term=inline-CTA-brief), The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. The Southern Baptist Convention and others have reached a confidential settlement in a high-profile lawsuit that accused a former leader of sexual assault, ending a six-year legal drama that expanded victims’ rights in Texas, helped prompt a broader reckoning over child sexual abuse in evangelical churches and showed that a prominent conservative activist and Texas House candidate [repeatedly downplayed](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/03/27/houston-jared-woodfill-gop-paul-pressler-southern-baptist/) abuse allegations. In 2017, Duane Rollins filed the lawsuit accusing Paul Pressler, a longtime Southern Baptist figure and former Texas judge, of decades of rape beginning when Rollins was a 14-year-old member of Pressler’s church youth group in Houston. Rollins claimed in court documents that the alleged attacks pushed him into drug and alcohol addictions that kept him in prison throughout much of his adult life. After disclosing the alleged rapes to a prison psychiatrist, Rollins filed the suit in Harris County against Pressler along with other defendants who he accused of enabling or concealing Pressler’s behavior — including the Southern Baptist Convention and Jared Woodfill, the former chair of the Harris County GOP and Pressler’s longtime law partner. Rollins’ claims were a key impetus for “ [Abuse of Faith](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/investigations/abuse-of-faith/),” a 2019 investigation by the Houston Chronicle and San Antonio Express-News into sexual abuse in the SBC, the nation’s second-largest faith group. The series [led to](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/investigations/article/Southern-Baptist-sex-abuse-timeline-17194777.php) major reforms in the SBC, revelations that top leaders had routinely ignored or [downplayed warnings](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/investigations/article/Bombshell-400-page-report-finds-Southern-Baptist-17190816.php) about a sexual abuse crisis, and an ongoing Department of Justice investigation. As part of Rollins' suit, at least seven other men came forward with their own allegations of [sexual misconduct](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/More-men-accuse-former-Texas-judge-Baptist-12831892.php) by Pressler in incidents spanning four decades. The suit also showed that Woodfill, a prominent anti-LGBTQ+ activist, was [aware of allegations](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/03/27/houston-jared-woodfill-gop-paul-pressler-southern-baptist/) that Pressler was a sexual predator but continued to provide him with young, male personal assistants who worked out of Pressler’s River Oaks home. Three of the men have [alleged sexual abuse](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/03/27/houston-jared-woodfill-gop-paul-pressler-southern-baptist/) or misconduct. Woodfill is [currently running](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/11/17/texas-house-jared-woodfill/) for a Texas House seat against incumbent Rep. [Lacey Hull](https://www.texastribune.org/directory/lacey-hull/), R-Houston, and has been endorsed by Attorney General Ken Paxton and Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller. Pressler, 93, is one of the most influential evangelical figures of the last half-century, and is considered the co-architect of the SBC’s “conservative resurgence” that began in the late 1970s and prompted the faith group to adopt literal interpretations of the Bible, align more closely with the Republican Party, ban women from preaching and strongly condemn homosexuality. Pressler — who formerly represented Houston in the Texas House and served for 14 years as a state appeals court judge — is also an influential figure in GOP politics. His [endorsement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/05/16/long-time-texas-conservative-activist-endorses-cruz-for-president/) has for years been sought by conservative evangelical politicians, including U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. In 1989, Pressler was nominated to lead the Office of Government Ethics under President George H.W. Bush, though the bid was later withdrawn; and Pressler is a founding member of Council for National Policy, a secretive network of conservative judges, politicians, media figures, megadonors and wealthy business owners that is currently led by Tony Perkins, head of the anti-LGBTQ+ Family Research Council. Pressler denies the allegations and has not been criminally charged for any of the alleged abuses. An attorney for Pressler did not respond to a requests for comment about the settlement, which is not public. In a statement, legal representatives for the Southern Baptist Convention and its executive committee confirmed that they had “entered into a confidential settlement agreement” despite being “fully prepared” to proceed to the trial for the suit, which was scheduled for February after being postponed twice this year. “However, several factors ultimately made settlement the more prudent choice,” they wrote. “Chief among those factors was the horrendous nature of the abuse allegations, the likelihood that counsel for the SBC and Executive Committee would have to confront and cross-examine abuse survivors, the Executive Committee’s current financial condition, and the willingness of multiple insurance carriers to contribute to the terms of the settlement.” Michael Goldberg, who represented Rollins along with a team of lawyers from Baker Botts, said Friday that they had resolved the matter with Pressler on \"mutually satisfactory terms,\" and added that their team was \"very proud of the settlement we reached against the Southern Baptist Convention and Jared Woodfill.\" Woodfill has denied wrongdoing and said this week that he has not settled the case, though a Harris County judge signed off on a motion last week that said “all claims, counterclaims and controversies” in the suit were resolved. \"We are fighting the insurance company and oppose any payment,” Woodfill said in a text message on Thursday. A pattern The settlement almost never happened. By the time that Rollins disclosed the alleged abuses to a prison psychiatrist in 2016 and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder as a “direct result of the childhood sexual trauma he suffered,” the statute of limitations for filing a lawsuit against Pressler had long passed. Nevertheless, Rollins pushed forward with the suit, arguing that the alleged rapes by Pressler — a spiritual mentor who Rollins said weaponized religious language to justify his predations — were so traumatizing that he unconsciously developed a sort of Stockholm syndrome that made it impossible to recognize himself as a victim until decades had passed. Thus, Rollins argued, his statute of limitations should have begun when he realized he had been abused, rather than when the last assault occurred. His lawsuit was initially dismissed on statute grounds. But Rollins appealed and, eventually, had the [dismissal overturned](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Texas-Supreme-Court-rules-against-Southern-17076007.php) by the Texas Supreme Court, which agreed with Rollins’ arguments.. The court’s opinion was a [major victory](https://cmf.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Texas-Supreme-Court-rules-against-Southern-17076007.php) for sexual abuse victims and their advocates, who have for years pointed to research that shows child sexual trauma can remap developing brains and make it difficult for many survivors to come forward until after their 50th birthday, and after their standing to file lawsuits has elapsed. Rollins’ lawsuit also uncovered a [40-year pattern](https://cmf.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/More-men-accuse-former-Texas-judge-Baptist-12831892.php) of alleged abuses by Pressler. As part of the suit, a former member of Pressler’s youth group said in a sworn affidavit that Pressler [molested him](https://cmf.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/More-men-accuse-former-Texas-judge-Baptist-12831892.php) in 1977 while the two were in a sauna at the country club in Houston’s tony River Oaks neighborhood. The man was entering his sophomore year in college at the time; Pressler, meanwhile, was a youth pastor at a Presbyterian church in Houston. He was ousted from that position in 1978 after church officials received information about “an alleged incident,” according to a letter introduced into the court file. Soon after, Pressler ramped up his involvement in Southern Baptist life. Rollins said Pressler began sexually abusing him not long after. He said the rapes continued on and off for nearly a quarter-century, often while he was working as Pressler’s aide. In 2004, court records show that a small group of leaders at First Baptist Church of Houston were made aware of allegations that Pressler, a powerful deacon at the church, had undressed and groped a young man at his home. In a [letter to Pressler](https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/b74f68bf318353337489d4432ae222c0/FBC%20Houston%20email%20REDACTED.pdf) that was unearthed as part of Rollins’ lawsuit, the church leaders condemned Pressler’s \"morally and spiritually\" inappropriate behavior. They also feared that publicizing the allegations would [damage Pressler's reputation](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/03/27/houston-jared-woodfill-gop-paul-pressler-southern-baptist/) in their church and the Southern Baptist Convention. An attorney for First Baptist Church of Houston, which was a defendant in Rollins’ lawsuit, did not respond to a request for comment Thursday about the lawsuit settlement. The church has [previously defended](https://www.baptistpress.com/resource-library/news/houstons-first-baptist-responds-to-claims-in-pressler-case/) its handling of the 2004 incident, saying that there were differing accounts of what happened and that Pressler’s position on church committees and as a teacher were eliminated as a result. The same year that First Baptist was made aware of those allegations, Rollins filed a lawsuit for non-sexual assault against Pressler that was quickly settled for $450,000. Woodfill, who represented Pressler in the matter, said [under oath last year](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/03/27/houston-jared-woodfill-gop-paul-pressler-southern-baptist/) that he was told by Rollins’ attorney at the time that Pressler had sexually abused Rollins as a child. Despite that, Woodfill continued to lean on Pressler’s conservative reputation, connections and influence to bolster their law firm, providing him with the young, male personal assistants despite Pressler doing almost no work. “I can think of one or two cases that he brought in,” [Woodfill testified](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/03/27/houston-jared-woodfill-gop-paul-pressler-southern-baptist/) as part of Rollins’ new lawsuit last year. “He may have gone to one hearing in his entire time with us, two at the most. Really, it was his name. … He got an employee that worked for him. So he didn’t get a salary. He didn’t get a draw. He didn’t get a bonus. We paid for someone to come and assist him. That’s how he got compensated.” Woodfill [similarly downplayed](https://cmf.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/More-men-accuse-former-Texas-judge-Baptist-12831892.php) sexual misconduct allegations in 2016, after a 25-year-old lawyer at his firm alerted Woodfill that Pressler had told him “lewd stories about being naked on beaches with young men” and then invited him to skinny-dip at his ranch, court records show. The attorney said he addressed the incident with a longtime employee of Woodfill’s law firm, who made it clear that this was not the first time he’d heard such allegations. “I discovered that this was not unusual behavior for Pressler, and that he had a long history of lecherous behavior towards young men. Even going as far as bringing scantily clad men and parading them through the office,” the attorney wrote in an affidavit that was filed as part of Rollins’ lawsuit. Woodfill — who’d just played a key role defeating an equal rights ordinance for LGBTQ Houstonians — responded to the young man’s request for help with shock. “This 85-year-old man has never made any inappropriate comments or actions toward me or any one I know of,” [he responded](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/03/27/houston-jared-woodfill-gop-paul-pressler-southern-baptist/), court records show. The young attorney’s claims are similar in detail to those from other Pressler accusers, who said he leaned on his stature and connections in conservative religious and political circles to try and coerce them into lewd massages, naked swimming sessions or sex. One accuser — a young Houston Baptist University student — said in a sworn affidavit that he stopped pursuing a career in ministry, frequently had panic attacks and attempted suicide as a result of Pressler’s alleged behavior. Court filings also show that Pressler’s family was alerted about his behavior in 2017, when an aide claimed in a letter that he had “both heard stories of and personally witnessed” Pressler getting nude massages from “young men who work for him.” He also claimed that Pressler had recently bragged about skinny-dipping with three boys who were younger than 10, and that he had seen Pressler “manipulate” a 20-year-old into giving him a massage and then repeatedly kiss him. “He talks way more about nudity, the male body, being naked in spas in Europe, being naked in general than God, or his Baptist background,” the aide wrote before announcing his resignation. Pressler, he added, “needs to be stopped.”",
