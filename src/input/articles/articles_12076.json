    "text": "Lo dimostrano le parole del CEO Thomas Williamson, che, dopo aver appreso di questo cambiamento, si è lanciato in un commento un po' piccato su X contro Rockstar Games, a suo avviso rea di non essere stata rispettosa del lavoro svolto dal suo team, responsabile anche di centinaia di fix arrivati proprio con l'ultima patch. Le parole del CEO di Grove Street Games \"Parlando in modo del tutto ipotetico: È una mossa del cazzo rimuovere gli sviluppatori primari dai crediti con un aggiornamento, soprattutto quando un aggiornamento include centinaia di correzioni fornite da quegli sviluppatori che sono rimasti fuori dalle mani dei giocatori per anni\", ha scritto. Per chi non lo sapesse, l'ultimo aggiornamento di GTA: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition ha portato con se [una lunga serie di correzioni e modifiche, che hanno migliorato in maniera sostanziale i tre giochi](/notizie/gta-trilogy-definitive-edition-aggiornato-alla-nuova-versione-mostra-netti-miglioramenti-in-un-video-confronto.html) inclusi, che ora sono in condizioni decisamente migliori rispetto al lancio, quando la raccolta era stata accolta con recensioni negative e numerose polemiche da parte dei fan della serie.",

    "text": "TAMPA, Fla. — Days after Victoria Swearinger, her son, and daughter-in-law began moving boxes into their new home, the landlord's cleaning crew changed the locks and tossed out their belongings, including family heirlooms. The family made a call for action in January, with Swearinger telling ABC Action News, “Stuff that I’ve had since my daughter was two years old. When my grandma died. It's gone.” New Port Richey Police said it was a civil matter, so the family sued Sylvan Homes after they said the rental company refused to reimburse them for losses. The complaint states, “…a cleanout company hired by Sylvan Homes had made a mistake and cleaned out the wrong property.” Sylvan Homes did not return repeated calls from ABC Action News' Jackie Callaway, and their attorney refused to comment. Now, weeks later, the family's lawyer confirms they are satisfied after reaching a confidential settlement agreement with Sylvan Homes. We also wanted to know what happened to Ron Bharath, who we interviewed in August, after $4,000 vanished from his checking account. A hacker made 18 withdrawals the same day someone bombed Bharath’s email with thousands of junk messages. Cyber security expert Keyaan Williams said cyber criminals use what's known as email bombing as a distraction. They’re using that flood of emails to hide their tracks. Williams explained how email bombing works. “You receive so many emails in a short amount of time you don't notice the very important message that comes across that authorizes a bank transaction or shows that you're logging in from another device,\" he said. Chase denied Bharath’s claim saying the transactions came from a known device. ABC Action News notified the bank that Bharath never authorized the transactions. The update, Chase did end up returning $4000 to his account. Finally, we got good news from 94-year-old Delores Satler, whose oven exploded without warning in December. She wrote to ABC Action News after GE refused to pay for the glass door replacement on the 2-and-a-half-year-old appliance. We contacted GE, and days later, the appliance maker called Satler and offered to replace the glass free of charge. She now has a new oven door. Since January, our Taking Action segment has obtained more than $20,000 for consumers who made a call for action.

    "text": "The Ontario legislature passed a motion on Wednesday for the Ministry of Education to encourage and support all publicly funded school boards in partnering with police services through community school liaison officer (CSLO) programs.\nThe motion was introduced by Kitchener South–Hespeler MPP Jess Dixon. It passed 56 to 27 with the NDP and Green members voting against it.\nIn a news release, Dixon said community school liaison officer programs are designed to build meaningful relationships between students and officers, serving as a bridge between schools, families, and communities.\nHer motion comes after some boards opted to remove the school resource officer program, including in Toronto , Hamilton , Ottawa , London and Waterloo region , with the Waterloo Region District School Board pausing it in 2020 and later voted to end it in 2021. In Peel Region, the police service opted to end the program in July 2020 after community consultations.\nKitchener MPP wants police to return to Ontario classrooms as part of school resource officer program Should police be invited back into area schools? St. Thomas police chief says yes Dixon said the motion is not about turning back the clock, but about moving forward with clarity and purpose.\n\"As someone who has seen first-hand the positive influence of school resource officers, it has been a privilege to champion this effort,\" Dixon, a former Crown attorney, wrote in the release.\n\"This program is about fostering trust, creating connections, and ensuring every student feels safe and supported in their learning environment.\"\nDixon highlighted the importance of these partnerships in building trust and relationships within schools, protecting students from external threats like human trafficking and gang recruitment, and creating a positive perception of safety and security in the school community.\n\"When an officer's presence becomes a source of mentorship and support, it starts to replace fear with trust,\" she said.\n\"It moves us closer to a future where no child feels excluded from the safety and protection that every Ontarian deserves, and where a police uniform could become a symbol of security and reassurance for all,\" Dixon added.\nSome boards opted to remove the school resource officer program, including in Toronto, Hamilton, Ottawa, London and Waterloo region, with the Waterloo Region District School Board pausing it in 2020 and later voted to end it in 2021. (CBC) Waterloo Region District School Board's decision to suspend the program followed concerns raised by community groups.\nIn July 2021, the school board issued an apology to people negatively impacted by the program.\n\"The move to end the program aligns with our commitment to ensuring that our schools are welcoming and supportive learning environments for each and every one of our students,\" the board said in a statement on its website.\nMotion emphasizes collaboration: MPP Dixon said her motion emphasized collaboration and forward-thinking, recognizing past concerns while advocating for reforms to enhance the program's equity and impact.\nShe has also expressed her commitment to ensuring that the program is reimagined as a tool for safety, inclusion, and connection.\nIn Depth Waterloo Catholic board used school resource officers to handle student mental health issues, tantrums: review Apology for program that saw police in schools issued by Waterloo region's public board Dixon said she received support for the motion from a wide range of stakeholders, including law enforcement organizations, community leaders, and education advocates.\nThe Ontario Gang Investigators Association and the Police Association of Ontario have highlighted the critical role that CSLO programs play in preventing exploitation and supporting at-risk youth, according to the release.\n\"Yesterday's vote represents a meaningful step toward a safer, more trusting, and less divisive Ontario,\" Dixon said.",

    "text": "MoneyDJ新聞 2025-04-17 06:15:36 記者 黃文章 報導紐約商品期貨交易所（COMEX）6月黃金期貨4月16日收盤上漲106美元或3.3%至每盎司3,346.4美元，再度創下歷史新高，因投資人在關稅戰當中持續尋求避險，累計今年來金價已上漲700美元；美元指數下跌0.9%，5月白銀期貨上漲2.1%至每盎司32.98美元。紐約商業交易所（NYMEX）7月鉑金期貨上漲1%至每盎司980.1美元，6月鈀金期貨上漲0.1%至每盎司979.6美元。 富拓（FXTM）資深研究分析師盧克曼·奧圖努加（Lukman Otunuga）表示：「在美元普遍走弱、關稅政策宣布的不確定性以及對全球經濟衰退的擔憂之下，黃金仍受到強力支撐。」盛寶銀行（Saxo Bank）大宗商品策略主管奧勒·漢森（Ole Hansen）表示：「金價這波漲勢已顯得有些脫離基本面，因此存在回調風險；但在過去一年多的時間裡，每次回調都相對溫和，因為一旦出現下跌，就會有潛在買盤進場承接。」 全球最大黃金ETF道富財富黃金指數基金（SPDR Gold Shares, GLD）16日黃金持有量增加4.02公噸至957.17公噸，續創2022年9月以來新高。最大的白銀ETF安碩白銀指數基金（iShares Silver Trust, SLV），白銀持有量增加93.37公噸至14,066.34公噸。 世界黃金協會（WGC）中國區研究主管賈舒暢報告表示，儘管黃金進口和珠寶需求持續下滑，中國黃金市場在3月及整個第一季仍表現強勁，國內金價與黃金ETF資金流入創下新高，且央行持續買入黃金，突顯出黃金市場強勢上漲的態勢。 賈舒暢指出，3月黃金價格持續強勢上漲，中國與全球市場均創下歷史新高。以上海黃金交易所午後定盤價計算，3月是過去一年最強的月份；而以美元計價的倫敦黃金定盤價也達到自2020年7月以來的最高水平。報告表示：「地緣政治緊張局勢以及川普難以預測的貿易政策，使黃金作為避險資產的吸引力提升，美元走弱與黃金ETF投資增加也進一步推升價格。」 3月份金價強勁漲勢，也為第一季度帶來亮眼表現，人民幣與美元金價均上漲19%。以人民幣計價的金價創下自2002年上海黃金交易所成立以來最強的第一季；美元金價則創下自1975年以來的最佳第一季表現。 今年第一季金價上漲的主要驅動因素包括：在全球地緣政治與貿易政策風險升高之際，避險需求上升；對美國經濟成長與聯準會利率走勢的擔憂導致美元走弱；以及全球黃金ETF的強勁資金流入。 不過，中國第一季黃金批發需求仍然疲軟。第一季中國黃金批發需求為336公噸，比十年平均水平低29%，較去年第一季下降36%。賈舒暢表示，第一季黃金批發需求的疲軟主要源自於較高的基期，2024年1月創下有記錄以來最強的批發需求；而金價飆升也壓抑了珠寶需求。 另一方面，高企的金價有助於推動投資需求。中國黃金ETF已連續第二個月出現資金淨流入，3月總計達人民幣56億元（約合7.72億美元），持續的資金流入與金價上漲將總管理資產規模推至另一個月末高點——人民幣1010億元（約合140億美元）。黃金ETF總持倉增加7.7公噸至138公噸，也創下歷史新高。 賈舒暢表示，飆升的金價仍是3月中國黃金ETF資金流入的主要驅動力，全球貿易不確定性及其對本地經濟的潛在衝擊也進一步推升投資需求。2月與3月的強勁需求也促使中國黃金ETF創下單季流入紀錄。2025年第一季度流入資金達人民幣167億元（約合23億美元），相當於持倉增加23公噸——雙雙創下歷史新高。報告指出，前所未見的金價飆升、對其他本地資產信心不足，以及與美國升級的貿易衝突引發的成長擔憂，都是強勁資金流入的原因。 報告指出，值得注意的是，中國黃金ETF創紀錄的資金流入在第二季度仍在持續，截至4月前兩週，中國黃金ETF持倉又增加了29公噸，而總資產管理規模也在金價持續走強與美中貿易緊張升溫的背景下激增25%。 中國的官方黃金儲備在3月也再次上升。中國人民銀行3月份黃金儲備較前月增加9萬盎司或2.8公噸，達到7,370萬盎司或2,292.33公噸，為連續第5個月購入黃金（累計購入28公噸）。2025年第一季，中國共購買12.8公噸黃金。 報告表示，中國1月的黃金進口幾乎停滯，僅為17公噸，創下自2021年2月以來的最低月度數值——當時正值COVID防疫限制影響進口；2月進口回升至76公噸，但仍遠低於2024年平均每月的102公噸。從淨進口數據來看，疲弱情況更加明顯。1月普通黃金淨進口降至零，為2021年初以來最低；2月回升至49公噸，但仍較去年同期下降38%。 報告表示，短期內黃金投資需求預計將保持強勁，因美中貿易戰升溫打擊經濟增長與本地資產。受到全球貿易秩序重構與市場波動性的推動，全球黃金價格的強勢將提供進一步支撐。此外，儘管即將到來的中國五一勞動節假期可能提振銷售，創紀錄的高金價與經濟擔憂仍令黃金飾品需求前景蒙上陰影，但避險購買可能帶來一定支撐。 紐約商品期貨交易所（COMEX）5月期銅4月16日收盤上漲1.5%至每磅4.6855美元。 （圖片來源：MoneyDJ理財網資料庫） ＊編者按：本文僅供參考之用，並不構成要約、招攬或邀請、誘使、任何不論種類或形式之申述或訂立任何建議及推薦，讀者務請運用個人獨立思考能力，自行作出投資決定，如因相關建議招致損失，概與《精實財經媒體》、編者及作者無涉。",
