    "text": "\"Praying to stay alive,\" how a D-Day veteran remembers that battle 80 years ago\nSeveral World War II veterans including some who fought in the D-Day invasion on June 6, 1944 were honored in Fairport on Sunday.\nGeorge Steitz is among the vets who gathered at the Perinton Historical Society and Fairport Museum.\nHe’s 99 years old, but he was a very young man during the 1944 invasion in Normandy that helped liberate France. He said he and his fellow soldiers were just trying not to die as they stormed the beach in Normandy, an action which helped lead to the liberation of France and the rest of Western Europe.\n“We were so damn scared, here I am, 19 years old, I was praying, like everybody else, we were praying to stay alive,” said Steitz, who emphasized that “it was nothing like what you might think you know about war from the movies.”\n“You have to be in a war, to know what war’s about. You can see Saving Private Ryan, and all the movies, but you’ve gotta be there,” said Steitz.\nSteitz, who was a longtime athletic coach in Penfield, said that even though it’s been 80 years, he still often thinks of that time.\n“There isn’t too many days that go by that you don’t think about it. “It’s like being married, I lost my wife but I think about her every day, and just like the war, you just don’t forget those things,” noted Steitz.\nSome other local World War Two survivors will be headed to Normandy in June for the 80th anniversary of D-Day next month, but Steitz won’t be there. He said that he’s been invited before, but he doesn’t want to remember D-Day with an in-person visit.\nAmong the other WW II veterans at Sunday’s gathering in Fairport was Robert Persichetti, now 102 years old. The Navy veteran wasn’t in Normandy, but was stationed in the Pacific, and Persichetti said he aboard a ship at Iwo Jima when an iconic WW II photo was taken.\n“I was the radio operator aboard the ship, and we were offshore a little ways and when they raised that flag, I was on deck that day, and watched them raise that flag twice,” said Persichitti.\nPersichitti, who will be attending ceremonies in Normandy on June 6, said he’s not sure how much of WW II history is being taught in schools these days, but said that, “It shouldn’t be forgotten,” noting the thousands of U.S. military members who gave their lives.",

There is no official count of how many people took part in the Matareya iftar, but organizers said as many as 30,000 people attended, [Egypt Today](https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/1/131260/Matariyah-iftar-banquet-manifests-ingenuity-of-Egyptian-people-PM-Madbouli) reported.

Hamada Hassan told CBS News that no one had enough space in their home to host everyone, so they set up tables outside. It only continued to grow from there. Gulf News reported organizers begin preparing for the event around two months in advance every year. Preparations include everything from gathering necessary supplies to feed a whole neighborhood, to cleaning and decorating the streets, CBS News reported. Ahmed Ekram, an organizer said this year 10,000 meals were served, Gulf News reported, citing local media. Some in attendance didn't eat, but went to simply enjoy the camaraderie, CBS News reported. Local donations fund the costs of the event, which over the years has seen politicians, celebrities, and diplomats in attendance. “We do not care about the cost, as all the residents of the neighborhood participate in financing the table in order to bring joy and happiness to the people of the region and other neighboring areas,\" Ahmed Khalaf, one of the organizers of the 2023 event told [Arab News](https://www.arabnews.com/node/2284791/middle-east) at the time.",

A ação ocorre como forma de resposta, pelo princípio da reciprocidade, após a expulsão do embaixador do Brasil na Nicarágua, Breno Souza da Costa.\nContinua depois da publicidade\nClique aqui para receber as notícias do NSC Total pelo Canal do WhatsApp\nA expulsão do representante brasileiro foi confirmada pelo Ministério das Relações Exteriores. Já a decisão por expulsar a embaixadora da Nicarágua veio após uma reunião entre Lula e o ministro das Relações Exteriores, Mauro Vieira, na manhã desta quinta-feira.\nBreno da Costa deve deixar o país ainda nesta quinta, enquanto que Fulvia Matu já deixou o país nesta madrugada. A imprensa da Nicarágua divulgou a expulsão de Breno na quarta-feira (7), com base em fontes diplomáticas.\nRelações estremecidas A deterioração nas relações diplomáticas começou após a embaixada brasileira não enviar representantes às celebrações oficiais pelos 45 anos da Revolução Sandinista, que aconteceram em Manágua em 19 de julho.\nContinua depois da publicidade\nO presidente do país, Daniel Ortega, é um ex-guerrilheiro do movimento sandinista. A expulsão do embaixador brasileiro teria ocorrido como retaliação à ausência do país no evento.\nO Itamaraty afirmou que o embaixador não compareceu ao evento devido ao congelamento das relações diplomáticas entre os dois países. A decisão, que congela as relações por um ano, ocorreu após a prisão de padres e bispos no país.\nO governo da Nicarágua começou uma ofensiva contrária a Igreja Católica em 2022, já que os líderes da igreja estavam denunciando a guinada autoritária do líder esquerdista.\nA postura do Brasil era de mediação entre o Vaticano e a Nicarágua, já que o país pedia que o governo soltasse os bispos presos.\nContinua depois da publicidade\nRegime apontado como autocracia O índice V-DEM, que mede o status das democracias pelo mundo, coloca a Nicarágua como uma autocracia, regime em que o poder se concentra em uma única figura. O presidente Daniel Ortega foi reeleito para o quarto mandato, contudo as eleições de 2021 são vistas com desconfiança pelos Estados Unidos.\nEx-guerrilheiro do movimento sandinista, Ortega governou o país nos anos 1980 após o partido Frente Sandinista de Libertação Nacional (FSLN) derrubar o ditador Anastasio Somoza, o que ficou conhecido como Revolução Sandinista.\nHá acusações contra Ortega de nepotismo e de instaurar uma ditadura. Contudo, ele alega exercer um governo do povo e que “defende a soberania do país dos ataques dos Estados Unidos”.\nLeia também Oposição diz que chefe de campanha foi presa na Venezuela\nOpositores María Corina e Edmundo González são investigados por conspiração na Venezuela\nDestaques do NSC Total Edival Pontes conquista medalha de bronze no taekwondo em Paris 2024 Veja surpresas da cerimônia de encerramento de Paris 2024 Enquete: Qual o 4º lugar mais sofrido do Brasil nas Olimpíadas?

Together, they're on a mission to elevate the insurance industry and reach underserved markets through Locker Room Insurance.\nJohnson Jr. , known for his Hall of Fame football career with the Detroit Lions, has been deeply engaged in community service since childhood, in part because he is the grandchild of a Baptist minister. His dedication led him to establish the Calvin Johnson Jr. Foundation , which has made a difference for nearly 13 years.\n\"The feeling you get from serving people is contagious. It feels great knowing I'm serving my neighbors and providing for families,\" Johnson Jr. said.\nSims , a nine-year NFL veteran who also played with the Lions, shared a similar sentiment. \"We're big on finding solutions that benefit other people.

    "text": "At this point,\nBethesda should just give modders the green light to do whatever they want with Starfield, or at least, make it official.\nAhead of the launch of the mod support for Starfield later this year, the modding community has stepped up to realize one of the most sought-after features in the controversial game: pilotable mechs.\nDespite the allure of towering mechs scattered throughout the game's expansive universe, players have been unable to pilot them, leaving these impressive machines as nothing more than static decorations. However, this is set to change thanks to the ingenuity of dedicated modders.\nJared Kohr, known in the modding community as Korodic, is the lead in this ambitious project. His mod aims to make mechs pilotable and fully functional with the ability to traverse terrain and engage in combat.\nIn a recent video shared on YouTube, Kohr showcases the early stages of this mod, revealing a player controlling a mech suit equipped with weapons. While still a work in progress, the footage demonstrates the potential for a new and dynamic gameplay experience in Starfield.\nDespite the excitement, Kohr noted that the mod isn't in playable yet with the team facing several technical challenges. The lack of direct support or documentation from Bethesda means that modders like Kohr must rely on their individual expertise and the help of the modding community to bring the ideas to fruition. Kohr hopes his work will inspire others and potentially influence Bethesda to officially incorporate pilotable mechs into Starfield.\nThe addition of mechs is a significant enhancement to the game's exploration aspect, which has been limited to on-foot travel despite the presence of over 1,000 explorable planets. This decision,\nby design, has resulted in gamers asking for better means of transportation. The inclusion of mechs would solve this, all the while adding much needed depth to its planetary exploration and combat. This development aligns with Bethesda's promise of introducing \"all new ways of traveling\" in Starfield in 2024, which has fueled speculation about potential updates involving various forms of transportation, including mechs.\nWhile Bethesda has not officially confirmed the inclusion of mechs in any upcoming updates or DLCs, the community's efforts are, in a way, proof that the game continues to have\na robust and creative playerbase despite the criticism about its rapidly dwindling player base.\nThe prospect of piloting mechs in Starfield has generated significant interest and excitement, showcasing the impact as well as the importance of modding in extending the life and appeal of video games.\nAs the modding community continues to work on making pilotable mechs a reality in Starfield, players eagerly wait for a chance to experience this new feature.\nWhether or not Bethesda will officially embrace mechs in the game's future remains to be seen, but for now, modders like Jared Kohr are making dreams a reality for Starfield enthusiasts.\nHopefully, more from the modding community will step up\nas others have already left after feeling disappointed with how the game came out to be.",

    "title": "Geopolitical Conflicts Could Propel Bitcoin’s Next Bull Run: Arthur Hayes",
    "text": "Co-founder of BitMEX Arthur Hayes said of current geopolitical tensions, “This could be a high Bitcoin (BTC) price surging event.” War-related spending, especially in the Middle East, could increase government borrowing and inflation, according to him.\nThis would, in turn, save the US dollar from weakening, and would act as a hedge against devaluation of the currency.\nRising Middle East Tensions Could Boost Bitcoin Prices Hayes says increasing tension between Israel and Iran in the Middle East could have global market implications. If we were to spend more money on the military, using debt, those funds would then end up on the balance sheets of the Federal Reserve and commercial banks.\nInflation could increase, weakening the dollar and encouraging Bitcoin as an inflation hedge. The basis of this theory is a historical pattern in which the conflict has seen monetary expansion, which often runs into inflation.\nHe compares this to past situations, such as the 1973 energy crisis when hard assets — like gold — also surged in value. However, he predicts that Bitcoin — called “digital gold” — will reflect the same in today’s digital economy.\nUS War Spending Could Boost Bitcoin Demand Speaking to CNBC, Arthur Hayes argued that the US spent so much money through its debt-financed war spending that Bitcoin’s price could be catalyzed.\nWith more dollars circulated, it becomes more likely that investors will consider Bitcoin a store of value against which to protect purchasing power.\nThis is relevant in particular with rising inflation, as the latest US Producer Price Index (PPI) data exceeded the forecast at 1.8%. The concern with the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) monetary policy is that injecting liquidity further will likely result in higher inflation.\nThis, Hayes says, provides favorable conditions for long-term appreciation of Bitcoin. Just as gold has in the past, Bitcoin could be a safer bet for investors than fiat currency devaluation.\nBTC Offers Stability as Global Tensions Rise Meanwhile, Hayes also predicts that rising energy prices in the Middle East could further strengthen Bitcoin as buyers see it as a hedge against increasing conflict. If oil infrastructure is disrupted or the strait is closed, energy costs could skyrocket. In this scenario, Bitcoin could become a kind of “stored energy” in financial markets.\nSupply disruptions would pressure fiat currencies by inflating already high energy prices. For those looking to stay afloat during volatile times, Bitcoin may be a decentralized asset. Bitcoin may gain from this, but market volatility could also rise thanks to geopolitical stability, advises Hayes.\nHayes says optimism is great, but you need risk management in times like these, Especially with smaller cryptocurrencies; he recommends sticking to something wise and avoiding impulsive decisions. Reducing exposure to highly volatile assets can minimize the impact of geopolitical tensions on drawdowns in the crypto market.\nAs debt-financed, war-related policies continue, Hayes concludes that Bitcoin’s growth potential remains strong. Bitcoin might see a good run because the US government continues to provide military aid to Israel and expand its Fed’s balance sheet. Bitcoin has proven to be a successful crash cushion against weak fiat currency for decades.",
