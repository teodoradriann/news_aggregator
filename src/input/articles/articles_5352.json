    "text": "You step on the scale, hoping for a change, any change. But the number stares back, unmoved. Frustration bubbles up. Why can't I lose weight? Sound familiar? You're not alone. Millions struggle with this, and the internet's awash in fad diets (Robert Pattinson's potato diet, anyone?). But what if lasting weight loss isn't about deprivation, but about adding in the right foods? More Than a Diet: It's a Lifestyle Shift Before we dive into the power of superfoods, let's address the elephant in the room - sustainable weight loss is rarely about quick fixes. It's about creating a lifestyle that nourishes your body and fuels your energy long-term. Think of it like this: You wouldn't expect a car to run on fumes, right? Our bodies are the same. We need the right fuel to function optimally, and that includes achieving a healthy weight. Superfoods: Your Secret Weapon for Lasting Weight Loss Here's where superfoods come in. These aren't just trendy ingredients; they're nutritional powerhouses packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that can jumpstart your metabolism and help you shed those stubborn pounds. 1.

Quinoa: The Protein Powerhouse Looking for a satisfying alternative to rice or pasta? Quinoa is a complete protein, meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids your body needs. It's also high in fiber, keeping you full and satisfied. How to enjoy it: - Use it as a base for grain bowls with roasted vegetables and protein. - Make a quinoa salad with chopped cucumbers, tomatoes, and feta cheese. - Swap it out for rice in your favorite stir-fry recipe. 6. Salmon: Omega-3s for the Win This fatty fish is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which have been linked to weight loss and reduced belly fat. Omega-3s may also help regulate appetite hormones, keeping those cravings in check. How to enjoy it: - Bake it with lemon and herbs for a simple, flavorful meal. - Grill it and serve it with a side of roasted vegetables. - Add it to salads for a boost of protein and healthy fats. 7. Blueberries: Antioxidant Powerhouses These tiny berries are packed with antioxidants, which can help protect your cells from damage and reduce inflammation, both of which can contribute to weight gain. How to enjoy them: - Add them to smoothies for a boost of flavor and antioxidants. - Sprinkle them on yogurt or oatmeal. - Enjoy them as a snack on their own. 8. Spinach: More Than Just a Salad Green Spinach is low in calories but high in nutrients, making it an excellent addition to any weight loss diet. It's also a good source of fiber, which can help regulate digestion and promote regularity. How to enjoy it: - Add it to smoothies for a nutritional boost. - Sauté it with garlic and olive oil for a simple side dish. - Add it to omelets or frittatas for a protein-packed breakfast. 9. Broccoli: A Cruciferous Superstar Broccoli is another nutrient-rich vegetable that can support your weight loss goals. It's high in fiber and low in calories, making it a filling and satisfying addition to any meal. How to enjoy it: - Roast it with olive oil and garlic for a flavorful side dish. - Add it to stir-fries for a boost of nutrition. - Dip raw broccoli florets in hummus for a healthy snack. 10. Sweet Potatoes: A Satisfying Carb Swap Ditch the white potatoes and opt for sweet potatoes instead. They're lower on the glycemic index, meaning they won't spike your blood sugar levels like their white counterparts. How to enjoy them: - Roast them with olive oil and herbs for a delicious side dish. - Use them to make sweet potato fries. - Add them to soups or stews for extra creaminess and flavor. Beyond Superfoods: Tips for Success - Hydrate: Often, our bodies mistake thirst for hunger. Aim for at least eight glasses of water daily. - Mindful Eating: Slow down, savor each bite, and pay attention to your body's fullness cues. - Listen to Your Body: Don't force yourself to eat if you're not hungry, and honor your cravings in moderation. - Consistency is Key: Sustainable weight loss is a marathon, not a sprint. Focus on making small, sustainable changes over time. Embrace the Journey Remember, there's no one-size-fits-all approach to weight loss. It's about finding what works for your body and lifestyle. By incorporating these superfoods and adopting healthy habits, you'll be well on your way to achieving your goals and feeling your best. You may also like",

    "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – If you feel like housing is unaffordable, you are not alone.\nA new study from Harvard University found that a record half of all US renters spent more than half their income on rent and utilities in 2022.\nThe study found a scarcity of affordable housing to this date, but there is a glimmer of hope for Northeast Florida.\nMORE: Florida Democrats call on Gov. DeSantis to do more to address ‘affordable housing crisis’\nNews4JAX wanted to find out how Northeast Florida’s rental prices compared with the rest of the country after Harvard released its study and found that Jacksonville’s average rent is trending downward. But it still doesn’t spell relief for people already paying exorbitantly high prices.\nRenter Manny McElroy said Floridians are struggling.\nIt’s a sentiment he and other renters across the country are experiencing after digging deep into their wallets to pay for their monthly rent. According to the Harvard study, 12 million Americans spent over half their paychecks on rent and utilities which put them into the financial category that researchers call “severely cost-burdened.”\nMcElroy said his rent keeps increasing.\n″They go up like 25 [percent], for some people 75,” he said.\nHope however could be on the horizon for the state of Florida, and specifically Jacksonville with newly released data from economists at Florida Atlantic University (FAU).\nFAU Real Estate Economist Ken H. Johnson said despite the national numbers, data from Jacksonville shows that rent prices are either leveling off or declining — just a bit.\n“We’ve come down to a point where the average rent in Jacksonville is just over $1,700 per unit to avoid being house poor, or rent burdened, as defined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD,” Johnson said.\nRELATED: Income-based housing wait list remains long in Jacksonville as supply lags\nResearchers at FAU said that based on their calculations the average rent right now for Jacksonville tenants is $1713.70 per unit. Compare that to the average price for rent across the country which is $2,000 per unit, according to Zillow.\nThe experts said there are several reasons why rent prices skyrocketed over the past two years.\n“The demand to live in Florida, which is in part driven in part by COVID. The high interest rates right now are stopping people from forming those first household ownerships. So, there are a lot of people that are saying I just don’t want to borrow money at six and a half or seven and a half percent, especially in light of the fact that I keep hearing that interest rates, mortgage rates should be coming down in the next year or two,” Johnson said.\nJohnson said according to his researchers’ latest data, the income needed to avoid being rent-burdened is an annual income per household of $68,500 in Jacksonville.\nWhile news of the price of rent leveling off is encouraging to some, economists said the only real trigger to make rental prices drop substantially is if builders overdevelop more Florida communities.\n“That’s probably the only way that we’ll see significant drops in rent is that they literally have to over-develop, not by a little, but a lot, and then we’re going to start to see some pretty good multifamily apartment deals that would be out there,” Johnson said.\nAs for that report from Harvard, it doesn’t make any specific forecasts about the high price of rent, but there’s little expectation that rents will drop or that the overall housing market will suddenly transform into being affordable.\nCopyright 2024 by WJXT News4JAX - ",

    "title": "The History Of Chinampas, The ‘Floating Gardens’ Of Mexico",
    "text": "Favored by the Aztecs, chinampas are man-made islands used to grow crops in freshwater lakes — and the agricultural system is still used in Mexico today. The History Collection / Alamy Stock Photo Also known as floating gardens, chinampas are small, man-made islands built on shallow freshwater lakes and swamps for the purpose of growing crops.\nIn the space of just under two centuries, the Aztecs built a civilization that made ingenious contributions not just to Mexican culture, but to the entire world. There seemed to be no problem for which this ancient people couldn’t come up with a solution, whether that was city-building, warfare, or devising an accurate calendar.\nOne such problem was food. As the Aztec Empire rose, the population of its capital, Tenochtitlan, exploded, putting pressure on the city to find a way to feed its citizens.\nSo the Aztecs adopted the Mesoamerican agricultural system known as chinampas, building an elaborate system of floating gardens that would revolutionize farming in the region.\nThe Roots Of The Chinampa System Wikimedia Commons An 1883 illustration of a chinampa.\nIn pre-Aztec Mexico, indigenous Nahuatl-speaking peoples made their homes in the Valley of Mexico, near present-day Mexico City. Moderate temperatures, abundant fish and game, and fertile soil provided the perfect ingredients for civilizations to flourish.\nAt some point, possibly in the Toltec era (950 to 1150 C.E.), the people discovered that the soil under bodies of water like Lake Xochimilco was exceptionally rich in nutrients. So the Nahua people developed a creative way of turning the rich lakebed mud into fertile farmland: chinampas.\nThe name comes from a Nahuatl word meaning “square made of canes” or “in the fence of reeds,” giving a clue to chinampas’ design and function.\nTo build these floating farms, farmers stuck stakes into a shallow lakebed and connected them with a fence of woven reeds. Then, they stacked alternating layers of decaying vegetable matter and sediment dredged up from the bottom of the lake to form the base. The surrounding water irrigated the soil, while the rich organic matter made the chinampas an ideal place for growing a stunning variety of crops on relatively small plots.\nSoon, farmers were building these small floating gardens on lakes near their properties throughout the Valley of Mexico.\nAn Agricultural Breakthrough Library of Congress Chinampas in Santa Anita, Mexico in 1900.\nIt’s believed that chinampas had already existed for some 200 years before the Aztec Empire rose to power in the area. Then, in the 1420s, the Aztec leader of Tenochtitlan, Itzcoatl, formed an alliance with the small city states Tlacopan and Texcoco and seized the powerful city state of Azcapotzalco, thus establishing the Triple Alliance.\nTo ensure his people’s dominance, Itzcoatl needed a secure power base built on a productive economy, and in 15th-century Mexico, that meant agriculture. What’s more, Tenochtitlan had boomed in both population and size, leaving less farmland for a growing empire that needed even more food than before.\nThe solution was chinampas, which would allow the empire to build farm plots directly into the Valley of Mexico’s fertile lakes (Texcoco, Xaltocan, Zumpango, Chalco, and Xochimilco).\nBiblioteca Digital Hispánica A depiction of the siege of Azcapotzalco.\nBefore the rise of the Aztecs, chinampas had been kept small due to being private projects. But with much greater resources and power, the Aztecs could revolutionize the system, building a complex network of chinampas and canals.\nThey also built the Nezahualcoyotl dike through Lake Texcoco to block salt water and freshen the water, and drainage ditches to act as filters, from which they could harvest rich mud to periodically dig up and place on top of the farm plots.\nThese farms used materials and produced vegetables native to the area, so the chinampas also fostered a balanced ecosystem where local aquatic birds and other native animals thrived.\nHow Chinampas Sustained An Empire By the time of the Aztec Empire’s peak in 1519, thousands of acres of chinampa farms ringed the lakes surrounding Tenochtitlan.\nThe rectangular farm plots were often hundreds of feet long, allowing Aztec farmers to grow corn, beans, and squash in amounts large enough to sustain hundreds of thousands of people. According to the BBC , these plots were so efficient that they could yield 13 times as much produce as dry farming.\nWikimedia Commons At its height, Tenochtitlan was home to up to 400,000 people.\nOther crops grown on the chinampas included tomatoes, peppers, herbs, flowers, and amaranth grain, which is similar to rice.\nThe Aztec Empire’s zenith coincided with the arrival of a disruptive new influence in the region: the Spanish. Hernán Cortés visited Tenochtitlan in 1519. In his second letter to Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, Cortés described the abundance of produce on offer in the city’s markets, much of which would have been grown on chinampas:\n“There are all kinds of green vegetables,” he wrote, “especially onions, leeks, garlic, watercresses, nasturtium, borage, sorrel, artichokes, and golden thistle; fruits also of numerous descriptions, amongst which are cherries and plums, similar to those in Spain; honey and wax from bees, and from the stalks of maize, which are as sweet as the sugar-cane.\n“Honey is also extracted from the plant called maguey, which is superior to sweet or new wine; from the same plant they extract sugar and wine, which they also sell.”\nBy 1521, the Aztecs had fallen to the Spanish invaders. But those who survived war and disease would continue to maintain traditions like chinampa agriculture for years afterward.\nThe Franciscan chronicler Fray Juan de Torquemada, writing in his survey Monarquía Indiana circa 1615, noted that the Indigenous people of Mexico “with little effort, cultivate and collect their corn, because all these are ‘camellones,’ otherwise known as chinampas, which are furrows built on the water surrounded by ditches, thereby eliminating any risk.”\nChinampas In The Modern World: A Solution To Food Supply Issues? Emmanuel Eslava/Wikimedia Commons Today, only about 125 acres of the surviving chinampas are used for traditional agriculture.\nAs long as the lakes around the once-mighty city of Tenochtitlan stood, chinampas were the ideal solution to the region’s food needs. But over the centuries, Spanish colonial rulers gradually drained more and more of the lakes.\nMeanwhile, chinampas gradually fell out of favor due to the influence of Spanish colonizers and urbanization, and generations of farmers brought up with European methods of farming gradually lost interest in the traditional method.\nToday, National Geographic reports, about 5,000 acres of chinampas remain. Of these, only about 125 acres are used for traditional agriculture.\nStill, this method is so efficient that some Mexico City residents are working to revive the practice to improve food security and preserve the area’s cultural heritage. Restoring these gardens could also mean creating wildlife havens for native species, like the critically endangered axolotl. In fact, the chinampas of Lake Xochimilco are now designated as a protected UNESCO heritage site.\n“These techniques are already disappearing,” says Don Miguel de Valle, one of the farmers leading the chinampas revival. “But this is very effective. It’s the most local way of feeding people.\n“My goal is to conserve what people have been doing here for hundreds of years.”",

In case of doubt the old ones are always better.\nCobra shot is the ability that needs fixing.Either the animated projectile speed or its actual time to hit its mark reeally feels so slow. Its like archery in ES:Oblivion, the projectile animation (or time to hit) feels more like a weak throw, not a powerful shot.The _feeling_ of casting Cobra shot is more like how throwing the Wildfire Bombs should be, not a charged projectile.\noh yeah more annoying, ugly, unnecessary visual clutter\nSure, they're at work proved.\nWhy is every wowhead comment section full with people who hate the game? I mean no one is forcing you to play, if you don't enjoy it you can always leave ffs.\nYou know what I'd love for articles about new visuals? A comparison to the current/old visual.\nthanks for mentioning exactly what the update was on some of these because I would struggle to figure it out alongside the \"spirit wolf now scales with the player model and is more transparent\" zero visual change update.\nthey also updated Bestial Wrath to be more defined too, like the warrior enrage.\nIt's noticable that these preview videos are usually being done with furry races. I think personal preferences should play less of a role and perhaps races that don't have excessively unique skeletons would be a better choice.Also not having a comparison to old animations (albeit in this case, there isn't really an old animation) is an odd choice.\nOn the back of the character you can see a new animation of the sprint. This should be standard for the Hunter as well as the Rogue and Druid.\nwow is saved !\nI played on the PTR for a while and while the changes are subtle the new animations just feel increadibly smooth and nice. It's hard to explain. I think pets have better attack animations too and the way pets are summoned (like Dire Beast) looks really good now.Each individual change is not much but put together it makes a big difference IMO.\nThey also need to do a visual update on Aimed Shot and Rapid Fire with the new reworked MM Hunter\nDont see much difference exept Barbed Shot\nIn the meantime, I only hope that one day glyphs will arrive to allow me to play a low fantasy hunter who shoots bullets... only bullets.I play a dwarf mountaineer from Ironforge: why do I have to shoot purple magic bullets, or snakes? SNAKES!I beg you Blizzard, give us glyphs to play simple characters.\nCan we get some updated idle animations for guns and crossbows?\nIs there even a difference?",

    "text": "Des grèves chez Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE à partir de début décembre sont \"possibles et même nécessaires\", a déclaré le syndicat IG Metall dans un avis publié vendredi, alors que le conflit entre les syndicats et la direction au sujet des licenciements et des fermetures d'usines s'intensifie.\n\"Des grèves sont possibles et également nécessaires à partir de début décembre\", a déclaré IG Metall dans un document distribué aux employés et consulté par Reuters, ajoutant qu'un accord existant pour ne pas organiser de débrayages prendra fin le 30 novembre.\nDes grèves dites d'avertissement, généralement de quelques heures, dans les usines allemandes du constructeur automobile devraient avoir lieu dès lundi, ont indiqué des personnes au fait du dossier, ce qui marquerait les premiers arrêts de travail à grande échelle pour le constructeur automobile depuis 2018.\nVolkswagen a réclamé une baisse de 10% des salaires, arguant d'un besoin urgent de réduire ses coûts et d'augmenter ses bénéfices pour rester compétitif et défendre ses parts de marché face à la concurrence des entreprises chinoises et à la baisse de la demande de voitures en Europe.\nLes représentants syndicaux et la direction se réuniront à nouveau le 9 décembre pour poursuivre les négociations sur une nouvelle convention collective.\nLes syndicats s'opposent à toute proposition de la direction qui ne fournirait pas un plan à long terme pour chaque usine Volkswagen. Ils ont présenté des mesures visant à éviter les licenciements et les fermetures d'usines grâce à une réduction du temps de travail et au renoncement de primes - des dispositions qui constitueront la base des négociations.\nToutefois, la direction a déclaré qu'elle n'était pas prête à abandonner les discussions sur les fermetures d'usines.\nLes grèves d'avertissement pourraient se transformer en débrayage de 24 heures ou en grève illimitée si un accord n'est pas trouvé lors du prochain cycle de négociations salariales, faisant peser le risque d'une réduction de la production de Volkswagen à un moment où le constructeur automobile est déjà confronté à une baisse de ses livraisons et à une chute de ses bénéfices.\n\"Volkswagen déterminera à la table des négociations la durée et l'intensité du conflit - le personnel de VW dans tout le pays est prêt à faire grève\", a indiqué IG Metall.\n(Rédigé par Friederike Heine, Victoria Waldersee and Christoph Steitz, version française Mara Vîlcu, édité par Blandine Hénault)",
