[Tentativa de golpe na Bolívia foi covardia, condena Renato Janine Ribeiro] O ex-ministro da Educação no governo Dilma comparou o ataque boliviano com os atos golpistas de 8 de janeiro (Foto: Divulgação/ RedeTV!) O ex-ministro da Educação, Renato Janine Ribeiro, condenou a [tentativa de golpe de estado na Bolívia que ocorreu na tarde de quarta-feira (26) e ainda comparou com os ataques golpistas de 8 de janeiro de 2023, em Brasília.](http://www.redetv.uol.com.br/jornalismo/mundo/presidente-da-bolivia-denuncia-mobilizacao-irregular-de-unidades-do-exercit) O professor titular da Faculdade de Filosofia, Letras e Ciências Humanas (FFLCH) da Universidade de São Paulo e presidente da Sociedade Brasileira para o Progresso da Ciência (SBPC) chamou o [general Juan José Zúñiga](http://www.redetv.uol.com.br/jornalismo/mundo/general-juan-zuñiga-e-preso-apos-tentativa-golpe-na-bolivia), responsável pelo ato, de covarde. “Uma covardia espantosa ele [Zúñiga] não assumiu a responsabilidade. Você ter militares que deveriam ter a principal característica de quem escolhe a profissão das armas, que é a coragem, são covardes. Um acovardamento que vimos aqui também”, afirmou em entrevista ao “É Notícia”, desta quinta-feira (27). Para Renato, a tentativa de golpe que ocorreu no Brasil causou a desmoralização das Forças Armadas, assim como na Ditadura Militar. Os atos golpistas no Brasil realizados por apoiadores do ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro, possuem aspectos fascistas, conforme explica o professor. “Existe um elemento fascista, ou de extrema-direita, existe no ponto da mobilização popular”. Renato ainda destacou que o apoio de Bolsonaro é grande, no entanto, ele ressaltou que existiram fraudes nas candidaturas do ex-presidente nas últimas eleições. “Bolsonaro ganhou a eleição de 2018 e chegou perto em 2022, nos dois casos com fraude. Em 2018, impediram a candidatura do favorito, colocaram na cadeia e tudo. Em 2022, teve compra de votos, teve aprovação de emendas para distribuir dinheiro a rodo e ação da polícia rodoviária federal para impedir a votação de eleitores do nordeste”, opinou. O especialista ainda pontuou que não há “Bolsonarismo” moderado, já que nenhum personagem bolsonarista é moderado, e citou o governador de São Paulo, Tarcísio de Freitas. “Acho muito difícil, porque tem certos princípios aí que não são moderados, por exemplo, o princípio do assassinato de pobres, o fato que a polícia paulista invadiu comunidades e matou muita gente”, disse. Ao ser questionado sobre a possível reeleição de Lula, Renato comentou que o presidente aparenta querer ter um sucessor, assim como tentou com Dilma Rousseff e Fernando Haddad. \"Ele [Lula] tem qualidades que outro personagem no campo de política dele não tem essas qualidades. Não vejo outros nomes fortes no campo da esquerda… Penso que se o Lula estiver bem de saúde será dificilmente lançado um novo nome”.

    "title": "Researchers claim to develop first calcium-based battery technology as alternative to lithium: 'The highest theoretical energy density'",
    "text": "Recent battery news out of China will leave you expecting to see lab photos of researchers with milk mustaches. But these experts aren't wasting time dipping Oreos. They claim to have invented the first calcium-based battery that can withstand 700 charge/discharge cycles at room temperature, according to a report from Balkan Green Energy News, an online sustainable report site. It's part of the work to find an alternative to lithium, the costly and hard-to-gather metal used in most batteries. The Chinese calcium reports have been regular and impressive to start the year. Another lab summary published by Nature lists two dozen experts from multiple institutions who are involved with the science. In a recent update , team leaders from Shanghai's Fudan University say the innovation could lead the way to a lithium-ion substitute for powering smartphones. It's a concept they have already proved in the lab. The vision is for the flexible, textile-like power packs to be woven into clothing, according to Balkan Green Energy. Part of the successful chemistry to unlock calcium includes abundant oxygen. The scientists said , \"Calcium-oxygen (Ca-O2) systems show the highest theoretical energy density among calcium-based battery variants,\" all per the Balkan Green Energy story. A big perk for calcium is that it's 2,500 times more available on the planet than costly lithium, which (like many battery materials) is subject to foreign markets . It also has \"a possibly comparable energy density,\" reported Balkan Green Energy. What's more, some analysts are forecasting a worldwide lithium shortage as early as next year. There were around 595,000 tons of lithium produced around the planet in 2021. Demand is expected to hit more than 3.3 million tons by 2030, per a https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/29/a-worldwide-lithium-shortage-could-come-as-soon-as-2025.html from CNBC. Lithium demand is up in part because electric vehicle sales are continuing to grow. Reuters https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/global-electric-car-sales-rose-31-2023-rho-motion-2024-01-11/ that global EV and hybrid sales jumped 31% last year. While down from a 60% growth rate in 2022, the sales number remains healthy. \"The pace of growth is slowing, but that's what's expected in growing markets like this,\" Charles Lester, data manager for Rho Motion , told the news agency . \"You can't double every year.\" In addition to saving drivers money on fuel and upkeep, switching to an EV prevents nearly 10,000 pounds of air pollution from spewing into the atmosphere each year. That's about equal to the yearly air-cleaning work of more than 208 mature trees , according to information reported by the Arbor Day Foundation. The Chinese calcium concept still needs some work. Balkan Green Energy reports an as yet limited capacity and performance. Some more tinkering in the lab will hopefully produce a reliable lithium chemistry alternative, perhaps one that could even power EVs in the future. \"The Chinese scientists hope that the [tech ] could be enhanced through further engineering,\" according to the Balkan Green Energy summary.

    "text": "By Bill Galluccio ,\n1 day ago Photo: Pascal Deloche / The Image Bank Unreleased / Getty Images A woman got into a wild altercation with a priest during Mass at St. Thomas Aquinas Church in St. Cloud, Florida. The Diocese of Orlando said that the woman went to receive Holy Communion but \"appeared unaware of the proper procedure.\"\nFather Fidel Rodriguez briefly spoke to the woman before blessing her and telling her to go to confession before returning to receive Communion.\nThe woman left and returned for the 12 p.m. Mass. When she went to receive Communion, Father Rodriguez asked if she had received the Sacrament of the Penance, and she replied that it was none of his business.\nThe woman then reached into the Communion tray, grabbed the Communion hosts, and started crushing them. Father Rodriguez attempted to restrain the woman, but she refused to let go of the Communion hosts. During the struggle, the woman pushed Rodriguez. In response, he bit her on the hand .\nThe woman was then asked to leave the church.\nFollowing the incident, the diocese defended Father Rodriguez's actions.\n\"Further, while the Diocese of Orlando does not condone physical altercations such as this, in good faith, Father Rodriguez was simply attempting to prevent an act of desecration of the Holy Communion, which, as a priest, Father Rodriguez is bound by duty to protect,\" the dioceses said in a statement.\nWhen speaking to police, Father Rodriguez admitted what happened and said he was acting in self-defense .\n\"I bit her. I am not denying that. I was defending myself and the sacrament,\" Father Rodriguez told the officers.\nNo charges have been filed, but officials said that the incident remains under investigation.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
