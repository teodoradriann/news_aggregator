    "text": "Heat alerts remain in effect for a swath of the tri-state area Friday, with parts of New Jersey expected to see feels-like temperatures near 110 degrees as the threat of afternoon storms looms.\nAn excessive heat warning is in effect for Somerset, Middlesex and Monmouth counties. Check the latest weather alerts for your neighborhood here.\nNearly every day has brought at least a few showers or storms, and we are going to increase the storm activity into the weekend. Some of those storms could be strong to severe, capable of producing some locally heavy rainfall.\nAs the weekend inches closer, a weak ridge of high pressure that kept any storms more isolated will be replaced by an approaching front, which will help to keep the atmosphere more unstable.\nExtreme heat in and around the tri-state area will contribute to the instability, too. Heat advisories are up across most of our region through Friday. Heat index readings, or “feels like” temperatures, will hover between 95 and 100 degrees for most, while some parts of western New Jersey could feel as miserable as 103 degrees.\nFriday’s storms will be strongest from the New York City area to the west and south. The day begins relatively dry, but by mid-afternoon, storms will start to move into the area. They will continue right through the evening commute. Plan for extra time to head home, especially if your route takes you through low-lying or flood-prone areas.\nThe main threats from Friday’s and the weekend’s storms will be isolated flooding and isolated damaging straight-line wind gusts. The gusty wind could snap tree branches and cause downed power lines.\nExpect a repeat performance on Saturday and perhaps Sunday, too, with flooding and damaging wind remaining slight threats from afternoon and evening storms.\nRain totals through the weekend should add up to an inch or two in the western half of our region, while most will see between a half inch and an inch. In the areas where the heavier pockets of rain set up, totals could be closer to the 2-3 inch range.",

    "title": "Sound Revolution: Operly Brings its Acclaimed Intelligence III Speakers to Israel",
    "text": "LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM, December 28, 2023 /\nEINPresswire.com/ -- Operly, a company renowned for its advanced audio technology, has announced the introduction of its flagship line, the Operly Intelligence III horn loudspeakers, to the Israeli market, specifically in Tel Aviv. This marks a significant expansion for the brand, which is headquartered in London, as it brings its innovative audio solutions to a new audience.\nThe Operly Intelligence III is engineered for audiophiles who seek high-quality sound. This new generation of full-range speakers merges sophisticated engineering with state-of-the-art technologies. The outcome is an audio experience characterized by rich, clear sound that enhances the listening experience.\nThe Operly Intelligence III features a unique design and advanced technology. The speaker's monocoque body, made from high-grade fiberglass, boasts a uniform thickness of 15mm along the entire length of the backward horn. This design looks good and helps improve the speaker's sound quality.\nThe Operly Intelligence III incorporates both classic and innovative elements. The driver's unique design features a short coil with a small diameter and a high gap, ensuring uniformity in the magnetic field and fidelity in sound reproduction. A patented full-range horn system is another highlight, eliminating connections between the forward and backward horns. This design allows for a seamless integration of the front horn with the speaker diaphragm, enhancing the overall sound quality.\nPracticality is also a key aspect of the Intelligence III's design. Its three-point support ensures stability on uneven surfaces, and its dimensions are optimized for minimal space occupation while providing an optimal listening experience. The backward horn is angled to create a comfortable listening zone at a distance of 2.7 meters, and the design also addresses the issue of standing waves by angling the sides of the horn to avoid parallel surfaces.\nThe Operly Intelligence III's high sensitivity audio system creates an immersive listening experience, akin to being in a symphony hall. This allows for clear conversation even at high playback volumes, making it ideal for various settings.\nCustomers can personalize their Operly Intelligence III speakers with a wide range of finishes, including options from the German automotive color palette, allowing for a perfect match with any interior design.\nKonstantin Neymark, the founder of Operly, commented on the launch: \"You are used to a narrow throat horn, but we have implemented a wide throat one. And we have a different result. In our view, the wide throat horn provides the most detailed, coherent, musical, and live sound. This is the amazement of feeling live sound. Perhaps, this is the most important thing - Operly allows you to 'see with your ears...'\"\nIt is now available for purchase, with a suggested retail price of £33,000 / €37,000 / $40,000. Customers are invited to specify their color preferences upon ordering.\nFor more information, please visit\nwebsite\nAmir Brand\nOperly Ltd\n+972 9-880-4401\n[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\nVisit us on social media:",

    "text": "Microsoft layoffs: 1,900 workers at Activision Blizzard and Xbox to be let go [Eric Lagatta](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/5803430002/eric-lagatta/) [Paul Davidson](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/2646662001/paul-davidson/) Microsoft will lay off 1,900 employees at Activision Blizzard and Xbox, the latest tech company to announce cuts so far in 2024. The layoffs represent about an 8% cut of its video gaming staff of 22,000 workers and come months after Microsoft [acquired Activision](/story/money/2023/10/13/microsoft-activision-blizzard-call-of-duty-acquisition-deal/71167139007/) in a blockbuster deal. The $69 billion transaction in October represented one of the largest tech deals in history as Microsoft took over the studios behind bestselling games like Call of Duty, Diablo and Overwatch for its Xbox console. The planned cuts are part of a larger “execution plan” that would reduce “areas of overlap,” Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer wrote in an internal memo, which was quoted in multiple news reports. \"We are grateful for all of the creativity, passion and dedication they have brought to our games, our players and our colleagues,\" Spencer is quoted as saying in the memo. \"We will provide our full support to those who are impacted during the transition.\" Microsoft confirmed news of the layoffs when reached Thursday by USA TODAY but declined to provide a copy of the memo. Layoffs: [Business Insider to lay off around 8% of employees in latest media job cuts](/story/money/2024/01/25/business-insider-layoffs/72351587007/) Blizzard executives announce resignations Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard was seen as [ a strategy to keep pace](/story/money/2024/01/16/microsoft-worth-more-than-apple/72239504007/) with Sony and Nintendo in a console race by adding more games to its multi-game subscription service and cloud gaming libraries. Microsoft’s Xbox gaming console, which ranks third in sales behind PlayStation and Nintendo, seeks to fold Activision titles into its Game Pass service, which isn't unlike Netflix but for video games. The Wall Street Journal [reported](https://www.wsj.com/tech/microsoft-layoffs-videogaming-staff-4cc124c7?page=1) that the planned cuts, which mostly target Activision Blizzard employees, reflect \"redundancies\" after the October acquisition of video game company. Spencer said in the cited memo that Microsoft would provide location-dependent severance to all laid-off employees. Alongside the layoffs, two Blizzard Entertainment executives are leaving the company, President Mike Ybarra and design chief Allen Adham, a Microsoft spokesman told multiple outlets. Ybarra confirmed the news himself of his immediate departure in a [post](https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1750527310493868293) Thursday on social media platform X. \"Leading Blizzard through an incredible time and being part of the team, shaping it for the future ahead, was an absolute honor,\" Ybarra said in the post. Other tech layoffs in the news Several big-name companies have already announced 2024 job cuts, including [Amazon](/story/money/2024/01/10/twitch-layoffs-job-cuts/72174329007/), [eBay](/story/money/2024/01/24/ebay-layoffs-2024/72335627007/) and In the tech sector, at least, job cuts are fewer this year than last. Another layoff tracking site, [Layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/), reports that [76 tech companies had announced 21,370 layoffs](https://layoffs.fyi/) through late January. By contrast, 277 firms had laid off 89,709 workers through January 2023. But some economists foresee more layoffs to come, amid talk of a [possible economic slowdown later in 2024](/story/money/2024/01/22/shrinking-profits-spark-layoffs/72283931007/).",

While the promise of chlorinated thrills is exciting—I mean what’s not to love about the idea of a haunted pool?—the silly premise does overstay its welcome and barely treads water.\nThe Wallers are a sweet family of four trying to stay strong in the face of father Ray’s (Wyatt Russell) professional baseball career and recent multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis. They’re searching for the perfect place to put down roots as they all adjust to a new way of life. His wife Eve (Kerry Condon) is the primary caregiver and parent and the recently appointed breadwinner. Meanwhile, their teenage daughter Izzy (Amélie Hoeferle) and young son Elliot (Gavin Warren) do their best to keep the status quo and appear happy for their parents.\nThen, they just so happen to find the perfect suburban family home with plenty of bedrooms and a swimming pool in the backyard. It’s just what Ray needs for hydrotherapy! It seems like the perfect match, a new start into the supposed perfect American family life. Just like in a swimming pool, everything looks calm on the surface. But once you dive in, the quiet chaos reveals itself.\nAlso Read:\n‘Roadkill’ Review: Modern Exploitation With Mixed Messages\nQuickly, Eve, Izzy, and Elliot discover something is very wrong with their pool. Each has their own unique terrifying experience while finding a moment of peace in their new watery “haven”. Shadows lurk on the pool’s edge, beings mutter from the drains, and innocent pool games turn sinister. But for Ray, it really is a haven as his symptoms seem to diminish the longer he spends in the water. As the headline says, it’s essentially The Amityville Horror but in a backyard swimming pool.\nYes, it’s incredibly silly. And yet, the script gives us a rather well-developed horror family, with each character given just enough interiority to make them sympathetic and worth rooting for. Co-writers McGuire and Rod Blackhurst (who also wrote the short film on which the feature is based) stretch the horror tropes of horror mother, pissed-off sister, and annoying little brother to give us a family of people who really do love each other. There’s no doubting their bond and how badly they all want to cling to the ideal of the perfect American family.\nBut, the rest of Night Swim‘s story isn’t so lucky as it begins to crumble under its own weight as the film progresses. As a fan of cosmic horror, I love a good unknowable entity. But here, McGuire and Blackhurst use that to a degree that it feels like a lazy solution to the problem of developing a short film into a fully realized feature. The lore teased in the first half is interesting and bizarre, but once exposition dumps come into the picture, whatever lurks in the Wallers’ pool loses its fright factor.\nAlso Read:\n‘Femme’ Review: An Alluring Queer Revenge Thriller\nThankfully, the use of practical effects and the cinematography framing the pool itself keep the fear alive. There are seemingly only so many ways to film a concrete hole in the ground, but director of photography\nCharlie Sarroff finds new and fascinating ways to utilize shots in the water itself. Sarroff and McGuire work together to warp the perception of the pool’s size. Some shots make it feel like the ocean, keeping the bottom and sides of the pool obscured to trick the viewer into thinking this is a much bigger space. Flickering pool lights immediately revoke any feelings of safety in the quiet peace of a night swim.\nThe technical creativity of Night Swim is the film’s biggest saving grace. It’s obvious a ton of care was poured into taking the inherently silly premise of a haunted swimming pool and making it scary rather than just cheesy. McGuire and Blackhurst did achieve that, lore explanation notwithstanding.\nOverall, Night Swim is the cinematic equivalent of a belly flop: silly and fun to watch but the end is a bit painful. It’s obvious that Bryce McGuire has talent as a director, so hopefully his next project will let him truly spread his wings and show us what he’s capable of. There’s skill in how he develops his central family, as well as how he and his team can make a pool feel so damn scary. Regardless of that technical skill, Night Swim is ultimately water-logged with silly lore and a head-scratching ending. But, if you can sit down and realize that you’re watching a deeply silly movie, then you’re guaranteed to have a fun and wacky experience. And sometimes, that’s all you want from your January horror.\nSummary\nNight Swim is the cinematic equivalent of a belly flop: silly and fun to watch but the end is a bit painful.\nCategorized:\nReviews",
