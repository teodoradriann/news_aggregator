    "text": "CEBU, Philippines — The VisayasMed Hospital has launched a state-of-the-art medical laboratory in partnership with Singapore Diagnostics (SGD), raising the bar for healthcare services not only for Cebuanos but for the entire Visayas and Mindanao regions.\nOperated and managed by AppleOne Medical Group (AMG), the healthcare arm of the AppleOne Group of Companies, the facility is designed to cater to at least 1,000 patients a day.\n\"By teaming up with VisayasMed Hospital, we're able to empower and provide Cebuanos with expanded access to a diverse array of top-notch laboratory tests without needing to travel to Manila or overseas,\" said Ritche Joseph Manuel D. Evidente, President and chief executive officer (CEO) of Singapore Diagnostics.\nThe launching of the new medical laboratory reinforces AMG’s commitment to bring in world-class brands and building globally competitive facilities in Visayas and Mindanao and is part of AMG’s strengthened partnership with Singapore Diagnostics (SGD).\nSGD will fully operate the laboratory, both inpatient and outpatient, through their well-trained medical technologists and laboratory specialists.\n“AppleOne invests in hospitals and facilities, and partners with prestigious companies such as Singapore Diagnostics because we see how important investing in quality healthcare is. This is our way of helping elevate the quality of life of people in Cebu and the VisMin region,” said AppleOne CEO and President Ray Go Manigsaca.\nWith its collaboration with SGD, VisayasMed Laboratory further elevates healthcare for Cebuanos, now with the capacity to accommodate up to 1,000 patients a day.

    "text": "Check out photos of the Northern Lights last night from skywatchers across Wisconsin Due to a rare, strong geomagnetic storm, Aurora Borealis may be visible again tonight. The Northern Lights graced night skies across Wisconsin and the U.S. on Thursday night after an eruption of solar material caused the [NOAA Space Weather Prediction](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-storm-watch-10-11-october) to issue a [severe geomagnetic storm watch](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/2024/10/09/northern-lights-forecast-auroras-might-be-seen-in-wisconsin-thursday/75590287007/). Watches at this level are very rare. Strong geomagnetic storms can impact infrastructure, potentially disrupting communications, the electric power grid, navigation, radio and satellite operation, NOAA says. The watch continues into early Saturday morning, so if you missed the Aurora Borealis last night, you still may be able to see them tonight. But, if you can't catch the Northern Lights either night, you can enjoy these photos taken in Milwaukee and Wisconsin last night. More: [Northern lights could be visible in Wisconsin as part of a 'very rare' solar storm this week](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/2024/10/09/northern-lights-forecast-auroras-might-be-seen-in-wisconsin-thursday/75590287007/) What causes the Northern Lights? Also known as Aurora Borealis, the Northern Lights are [a natural light display in Earth's sky](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/10/northern-lights-aurora-when-time/73638964007/) that is famously best seen in high-latitude regions of the northern and southern hemispheres. The phenomenon is caused when electrically charged particles from space enter Earth's atmosphere and collide with [molecules and gasses like oxygen and nitrogen](https://www.jsonline.com/story/graphics/2024/05/18/northern-lights-colors-explained/73731506007/), causing the atmospheric particles to gain energy. To return to their normal state, the particles release that energy in the form of light, according to the [University of Alaska at Fairbanks, Geophysical Institute](https://www.gi.alaska.edu/monitors/aurora-forecast) website, which tracks the phenomenon. As Auroras form, Earth's magnetic field redirects the particles toward the poles through a process that produces a stunning display of rays, spirals and flickers that have fascinated humans for millennia. Whether hues of green, red, blue and pink dance about in the sky is due to the altitude in which the collisions occur, as well as the composition and density of the atmosphere at the time. When Northern Lights are active, the best time to see them is between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. Are the Northern Lights becoming more common? This isn't the first time this year people throughout Wisconsin caught a glimpse of the Northern Lights. In May, a [powerful geomagnetic storm](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/10/severe-solar-storm-2024/73642315007/) unleashed [spectacular views of the northern lights](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/11/aurora-borealis-photos-northern-lights-seen-us-europe/73652013007/) in areas of the U.S. where Auroras are seldom visible, [including here in Milwaukee](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/2024/05/11/northern-lights-seen-in-milwaukee-wisconsin-last-night/73653382007/). As the [sun nears the height of its 11-year cycle](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/01/northern-lights-solar-maximum-auroras/75449249007/) in 2025, people across the world can expect more frequent and brighter Northern-Light activity due to increased electromagnetic activity.

    "text": "Senator Ossoff raises concerns over Medicaid cuts\nSAVANNAH, Ga. (WTOC) - Republicans in Congress are proposing $880 billion in cuts to the committee that oversees Medicaid. They say it’s part of a broader plan to reduce government spending and cut taxes.\nBut Senator Ossoff says these cuts could have devastating effects on children, seniors, and hospitals across the state.\nRight now, Medicaid covers about 40% of all children, nearly half of all births, and about 70% of seniors in nursing homes.\nOssoff said slashing funds could put millions at risk of losing coverage and push more rural hospitals closer to shutting down.\nAs of last year, more than half of Georgia’s rural hospitals are struggling financially. Nine have closed, one stopped providing inpatient care, and 18 are at risk of shutting down.\nOssoff says Georgia’s long-standing refusal to expand Medicaid has already limited access to health care, and further cuts would only make the situation worse.\n“I am sounding the alarm that these proposed drastic cuts to Medicaid will fundamentally damage the health and safety of my constituents in Georgia,” said Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Georgia. “It will put kids at risk, pregnant women, and delivering mothers at risk, seniors in nursing homes at risk, and hospitals across our state into dire financial jeopardy.”\nIt’s unclear whether these cuts will actually happen. Just this week, President Trump said Medicaid “isn’t going to be touched.”\nAnd some Senate Republicans are pushing back, saying the House proposal goes too far.\nCopyright 2025 WTOC.

    "text": "El Brighton, con goles de Kaoru Mitoma y Georginio Rutter, ganó al Ipswich Town (0-2) y frenó el resurgir de los locales, que sumaban 3 partidos consecutivos sin perder.\nLos 'seagulls' se llevaron el partido en la segunda parte, cuando Mitoma mandó a la red un pase de Matt O'Reilly con un disparo en el que el portero del Ipswich, Christian Walton, pudo hacer mucho más.\nA 8 minutos del final, Rutter convirtió a la media vuelta un balón muerto en el área. El VAR revisó la jugada por posible intromisión a la visión del portero en fuera de juego, pero el tanto subió al marcador y el Brighton sentenció su primera victoria en Premier League desde hace 9 jornadas. Venía de 4 empates seguidos y de no ganar en liga desde el 23 de noviembre.\nBien diferente era la dinámica para el Ipswich, que había ganado al Chelsea y empatado con el Fulham, además de derrotar al Bristol Rovers en la Copa. Los 'Tractores' marcan la salvación, con 16 puntos, los mismos que el Wolverhampton Wanderers, antepenúltimo, mientras que el Brighton tiene 31 unidades y mira a las posiciones europeas a cuatro de distancia.",
