    "title": "台灣餐廳「樣樣都要自助」還提高售價，店家才該給顧客10%服務費吧？ - TNL The News Lens 關鍵評論網",
    "text": "最近Threads上有一篇爆紅文章在抱怨春水堂得由客人用手機點餐，到櫃檯結帳，還好意思加收10%服務費？\n在 Threads 查看 短短不到一天即累積50萬點閱數，並勾出春水堂員工回應。網友隨即熱烈討論發文，其中不罰各種對春水堂服務品質的客訴。\n文章本身很短，一如上述。但討論串很長，分享也多，各種對春水堂的文章也風起雲湧。關於春水堂餐點、服務的討論，是各大論壇常見的美食評點，見仁見智，沒什麼好說。但這篇文會爆的原因，還在於10%服務費上面。這也是台灣生活新聞中的萬年老哏。很多人覺得根本沒有被服務到，卻被收10%服務費，到底合不合理？\n老問題，新麻煩 雖然這是老爭議了，時不時就有人出來批評，但有一個關鍵，卻是最近才有，即科技進步（例如AI）帶來的衝擊。\n這次春水堂會被罵，就因為越來越多的連鎖餐飲，開始用手機app點餐。舉凡火鍋店到迴轉壽司，以至於各種餐飲，而如馬辣或壽司郎這種大型企業，甚至已有機器人送餐。\n過去對於10%服務費的爭議，都出在覺得員工服務品質不佳，不爽給服務費。現在既然少了人工流程，又要被加收費用，自然引發顧客不滿。\n這其中分別也不小。同樣是用機械送餐的迴轉壽司，一條通收10%服務費，但壽司郎就沒有，理由何在？爭鮮一直都是人工送餐，也沒收服務費。這在去年就引起網友討論。馬辣大部分的店都看到員工忙得昏天暗地，所以收10%服務費，沒看到有什麼人抱怨，但如台北中山店是機器人送餐，員工看來不忙。這是否又有爭議？\n多元觀點 等你解鎖 付費加入TNL+會員， 獨家評論分析、資訊圖表立刻看 到期自動續訂，可隨時取消，詳情請見訂閱方案 查看訂閱方案 已是會員? 登入 Share : 收藏文章 {{ data.name[0] }} {{ data.errorMsg }} 送出 {{data.member.name}} {{data.member.company}} {{data.member.job_title}} id:{{data.id}}\n回覆 Comment Form 你認同本文的觀點嗎？我們想聽聽你的看法。 {{ globalStore.data.commentedLists.discussion_members?.length }} 位討論 參與議題請先 登入 或 加入會員 參與議題 繼續閱讀",

    "text": "Drew Harris: drivers who ‘excessively’ break speed limits should face suspension\nDrivers who “excessively” break speed limits should face suspension rather than fixed fines, the Garda Commissioner has said.\nDrew Harris was speaking about actions gardai have taken to tackle an increase in road fatalities, which have risen to 69 compared with 51 deaths in the same time last year.\nThe Government has pledged to reduce speed limits on certain roads, introduce more speed cameras and roll out an awareness campaign in a bid to reduce the number of road deaths.\nSpeaking before the Policing Authority on Thursday, Mr Harris said that people who excessively break the speed limit should face suspension from driving rather than a fixed charge penalty notice.\n“I do think there is overall an issue around speed and how it is regarded and the sanctions and the availability of the fixed charge penalty notice, and the nearly entitlement to that process, no matter what your speed, whereas individuals (who) are really excessively breaching the speed limit and can only be dealt with by a fixed charge penalty notice when they should be realistically facing suspension for such, in effect, dangerous driving,” he said.\nIf you make it a numbers game, then the numbers become meaningless\nThe Garda Commissioner has issued a directive to Garda members, based on a Swedish initiative, to spend 30 minutes of each shift on roads policing.\nIn the first 12 days of the 30-minute operation, which began on April 12, Mr Harris said there was a 42% increase in the number of breath tests carried out compared with the same period in the previous month, a 25% increase in the number of vehicles detained, a 61% increase in fixed charge penalty notices issued for mobile phone use, and an increase of 22% in the number of people driving while intoxicated.\n“This is not something to do for eight weeks and then leave, this is now a permanent feature so we just want it to be a habit for everyone in uniform to spend 30 minutes on this and then we’ll look to see what the responses is from that,” he said.\n“But neither is it a numbers game… because if you make it a numbers game, then the numbers become meaningless. We want good detections to be made.”\nAssistant Commissioner Paula Hilman said average speed cameras will be rolled out in a number of areas in the third quarter of 2024.\nThey will be along the N5 in Swinford, Co Mayo, the N3 in Belturbet, Co Cavan, and the N2 at a location that is yet to be finalised.\nShe said: “The commissioner identified additional budget for nine static cameras. We just finalised those locations this morning. So next week we be will be announcing where those nine static cameras will be right across the country.”\nWould you like a lunchtime summary of content highlights on the Irish Examiner website?

    "title": "Sam McDowell: Patrick Mahomes wasn’t great vs. Vegas. But the Chiefs didn’t set him up to succeed. | NFL | lancasteronline.com",
    "text": "In the aftermath of what should have been a game-altering play — one that turned the punter into a quarterback — the Chiefs earned a new set of downs, prompting Patrick Mahomes to spin around and hurry his offensive line back onto the field. And a few strides away on the sideline, head coach Andy Reid was busy for a moment, instructing a staffer not to return a slammed helmet to tight end Travis Kelce. The play clock ticked toward 35 seconds. A surreal sequence has been the center of plenty of conversations over the past couple of days, including my column immediately after the Chiefs lost to the Raiders 20-14 on Christmas Day. What I didn’t know yet: It was simply a piece of a larger sequence that best tells the story of the worst Chiefs offensive performance at Arrowhead Stadium in recent memory. I’ll warn you in advance this column begins with a pretty lengthy string of events, but stick with me here, because you’ll soon see why the length is part of the point. Back to the fake punt: With just 14 seconds left on the play clock for the next snap, Kelce was without his helmet, so his replacement, Blake Bell, sprinted on the field. It was a late change in personnel that prompted a late arrival to the huddle, and therefore a late rush to the line of scrimmage. Too late, it turned out. Bell scurried to the line but was flagged for not coming completely set before the snap because, well, he didn’t have time to get set. That’s one play. One glitch in the operation. There were more. Just two plays earlier, the Chiefs double- huddled after Mahomes evidently saw players were not lined up properly. But even after a second huddle, the alignment still didn’t look right, and a frustrated Mahomes burned a timeout. More still. On the final play of that same drive — yes, these are all packed into a two-minute drill burst — the Chiefs attempted to rush some substitutions onto the field, even though there were just 17 seconds left on the play clock. As a result, they broke the huddle at 10 seconds, and Mahomes then had conversations with individual players, presumably about their assignment on the play. He hurried to snap the ball, barely in time, which seemed to startle running back Isiah Pacheco — he was still tucking in his mouthpiece. Oh, he was the intended receiver on the play, by the way. After it fell incomplete, a perturbed Mahomes looked toward the sideline. “Call the (bleeping) play, man,” he said. The Chiefs would complete the next pass for a short gain, though inbounds, and as Reid called the team’s final timeout with nine seconds remaining rather than letting it drain closer to zero, Mahomes mouthed one word that might has well have encapsulated the previous two minutes in its entirety: “Why?” Warned you it was a long description. A telling sequence, though. The Chiefs’ offense was downright painful to watch against the Raiders, and Mahomes had one of the worst statistical outings of his career. ( PFF graded it as his worst day in the NFL.) He certainly didn’t play well. But it wasn’t all on him. This is the needed context. You cannot re-watch that sequence and believe those in his headset put him in the very best position to succeed. Because they didn’t. At times, the operation worked against him more than it did to his benefit. The re-watch of the entire game prompts something obvious to stand out that had little to do with Mahomes and more to do with those piloting the ship. Disorganization. The Chiefs were a mess. Gone are the days of lining up a foot offside; they were struggling to know where to line up at all. I’ll remind you this is a review of a Week 16 performance, not an August morning in St. Joseph. So much of the conversation revolving around the Chiefs offense has focused on the receivers — with good reason — that sometimes we forget a separate issue can arrive before the play’s intended conclusion. Or, as was the case Monday, before its intended inception. You wonder why Mahomes played like he was in a hurry? Like he was sped up all day? Well, he was. By his team’s own alignment issues. By its collective confusion. Not just in the two-minute drill, either. That was the most glaring stretch but far from the only one. He burned a timeout later in the game after Richie James and Isiah Pacheco found themselves occupying nearly the same blades of grass in the backfield. That was a fourth-down call. Kind of a big play. “Yeah, that’s mine. That’s my fault on that,” Reid said Wednesday, tapping his chest when I asked him about pre-snap confusion. “I have to make sure that’s right. When I stand up here and tell you that I’ve got a piece of that pie, that’s directly pointed at me. I have to make sure guys can do that. I have to make sure we’re right there.” We are often in search of a clean and tidy reasoning for why the offense hasn’t played up to the standard it set over the last half-decade, which has invited a national narrative around the old offensive coordinator or the young wide receivers. But the most truthful one is much more complicated and layered. We can have real conversations about the receivers, the tackles, Kelce becoming a year older yet still garnering plenty of attention, the play-calling, Mahomes not being at his best, and on and on. But on Monday? Chaos pre-snap. Chaos post-snap. Why wouldn’t we link the two? Is it so unreasonable to believe the former changed the way Mahomes played? It effectively robbed him of the chance to survey the defense, or ponder what he might be looking to do with the ball once he received it, or ponder much of anything other than getting everyone lined up and beating the play clock. This isn’t trying to deflect blame from Mahomes, who, as I mentioned earlier, objectively played poorly. But don’t stop there. There was no synchronization to the offense, and that particular sentence isn’t strictly about a loss to the Raiders. But against the Raiders specifically, Mahomes quite evidently played without certainty and with hesitation. You might argue the uncertainty derives from throwing to a group of wide receivers who collectively lead the NFL in drops. There’s probably something to that. But I’d argue we’re overlooking another factor playing a role. If it’s disorganized before the snap, as it was Monday, what’s to provide confidence it will be run perfectly after the snap? Mahomes was as hesitant as he’s been all season in pulling the trigger to open receivers, which should be his primary focus this week, but it’s enough to make you wonder how much confidence he had the receivers would actually be in the windows we all see all film. Only he knows that answer. Which is where the Chiefs are — or at least where they were earlier this week. It does not necessarily mean it’s where they will be on Sunday, or in two weeks or the postseason. But only if they learn from it. Mahomes said Wednesday the goal is to play the game fast. The Chiefs have to catch up to the game first, because it looked too fast for them Monday. And that’s before the ball even arrives in his hands. ©2023 The Kansas City Star. Visit at kansascity.com .

    "text": "While most security decision makers are expanding their security tools rather than replacing them, this could create greater risks for practitioners.\nAccording to new Google Workspace research, while nearly two-thirds (62%) of UK-based IT leaders admitted to adding new security tools as they go along, those ending up with ten or more experience more security incidents than those with fewer.\nJustin Anderson, director of Google Workspace for the UK and Ireland, said the study highlights a long-running problem for cybersecurity practitioners, with many organizations falling into the trap of overloading teams with tools in the belief it will bolster broader resilience,\n\"This piecemeal approach to security not only fails to address the root of the problem but often exacerbates it by creating a complex and unwieldy security environment that is difficult to manage effectively,\" Anderson said.\nMeanwhile, the survey from Google Workspace found legacy tech is increasingly becoming a liability. This is an acute problem in the UK, where three-quarters of security leaders believe it's left them ill-equipped to handle the challenges of modern security threats, compared with just 59% globally.\nHowever, newer technologies are causing concern too. More than three-quarters of respondents told Google they believed that generative AI usage has contributed to a rise in security incidents - much more than the global average of 65%.\nMany IT leaders are also slow to act on these concerns, the study noted. Only a quarter of respondents said they have introduced AI-specific security policies, compared to a global average of 41%.",

    "text": "EFE.- El cantante español Raphael ha anunciado este miércoles su vuelta a la actividad musical a partir del próximo 15 de junio, sólo cuatro meses después de su ingreso hospitalario a causa de un linfoma cerebral.\n\"Con una ilusión inmensa, hoy puedo anunciar que el próximo 15 de junio retomaré mi agenda. Quiero devolveros, en forma de canciones, todo el cariño que me habéis dado durante este tiempo\", ha escrito el artista en su cuenta de Instagram.\nEn su mensaje, el artista ha asegurado también \"con enorme emoción\" que se encuentra \"muy bien y profundamente agradecido\", empezando por su familia, \"pilar esencial por su amor incondicional\".\n\"(Gracias) a toda la sanidad pública, por haberme cuidado con una entrega, profesionalidad y humanidad ejemplares\", añade Raphael., que ha agradecido a los hospitales donde ha sido atendido.\nA sus amigos, compañeros de profesión, medios de comunicación y a su público van los siguientes agradecimientos, \"por tanto cariño\", pero también \"por cada mensaje, por cada pensamiento y por estar ahí incluso en la distancia\".\n\"Me habéis hecho sentir muy acompañado y muy querido\", ha destacado el artista en un mensaje que concluye con un \"¡Os quiero mucho!\".\nSu ingreso se produjo el pasado 18 de diciembre, después de que se sintiera indispuesto –presentaba dificultades en el habla– en la grabación de un programa de Televisión Española.\nDescartado el ictus tras los primeros análisis, el artista estuvo ingresado durante diez días en dos centros hospitalarios diferentes en los que se le detectó un linfoma cerebral primario con dos nódulos cerebrales en el hemisferio izquierdo que \"justifican los síntomas neurológicos\" que presentó.\nTras su alta, ya se informó que Raphael, que tiene 81 años en la actualidad, había empezado a recibir tratamiento específico para esta patología y que continuaría haciéndolo a partir de entonces de forma ambulatoria.\nPor esta causa, se notificó la cancelación de los conciertos que tenía programados para los primeros meses de 2025 en Estados Unidos, República Dominicana, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico y México, como sucedió con los dos conciertos especiales que debería haber celebrado en Madrid los pasados 20 y 21 de diciembre.\nAhora Raphael retomará su agenda normal, tal y como ha confirmado también su agencia de representación, con conciertos en varias ciudades españolas entre el 15 de junio y diciembre.",

    "text": "Leading newspapers in Britain and Spain refuse to use social network X. yesterday, 22:46 68 Journalist Svyatenko Tamara yesterday, 22:46 68 The British newspaper [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com) and the Spanish La Vanguardia announced that they are leaving social network X. This statement was made by the publications on their websites. We believe that the benefits of being on X now outweigh the downsides, and that the editorial resources could be better used to promote our journalism elsewhere According to The Guardian, the US election campaign showed that X is a negative media platform, and its owner Elon Musk used its influence to shape political discourse. This is what we have been observing for some[Time], considering the alarming content that is advertised or contained on the platform, including far-right conspiracy theories and racism The Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia also announced the cessation of publications on X. La Vanguardia will cease to directly publish tweets on the social network X and will suspend its accounts. This social network has become a platform where conspiracy theories and disinformation resonate The Guardian has about 80 accounts on X with a total of 27 million followers. La Vanguardia has 1.3 million readers. The value of the social network X has decreased by more than 75% since its acquisition by billionaire Elon Musk two years ago.

    "text": "Reuters\nHas Kea poses next to plastic broomsticks at a warehouse in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, January 15, 2024. REUTERS/Chantha Lach/File Photo\nBy Chantha Lach\nPHNOM PENH (Reuters) - In a small warehouse in Cambodia's capital, a group of workers sit and spin waste plastic bottles into strips, turning them into bristles for brooms, of which they churn out 500 each day.\nFor the past 11 months they have transformed around 40 tonnes of discarded plastic bottles, about 5,000 bottles per day, by \"upcycling\" them into brooms they say are more robust than regular brushes.\nThose sell for 10,000 riel ($2.50) and 15,000 riel ($3.75) each.\n Plastic strips from the empty bottles are collected into a bundle on a machine, before being softened in hot water and sliced evenly to be sewn with metal wires into the ends of a bamboo stick.\nCambodian entrepreneur Has Kea, 41, wants to reduce plastic pollution in his community, in a city that produces up to 38,000 tonnes of all types of waste each day, according to its environmental department.\nAbout a fifth of that is single-use plastic that ends up in landfills and waterways.\n\"This broom is quite solid, not easy to break,\" said Suon Kosal, a 26-year-old Buddhist monk whose temple bought 80 of the brooms last month.\nKea buys empty plastic bottles from trash collectors and garbage depots. With the seemingly endless supply, he is confident about the longevity of his business.\nHe is also open to competitors stepping in to the market.\n\"This also help reduce pollution to the environment and encourages people to collect plastic bottles to sell to us at a higher price, which in turn, could earn them a better living,\" he said.\n(Writing by Juarawee Kittisilpa; Editing by Martin Petty and Alison Williams)\nCopyright 2024 Thomson Reuters .\nJoin the Conversation See Comments Tags: environment , recycling , Cambodia\nRead More",

    "text": "IMPACT: System brings heavy rain and blustery winds for Saturday Rain chances are on the rise tonight as our next system moves in. T.J. Springer has how much rain to expect and when the sunshine returns. Rain chances are on the rise tonight as our next system moves in. T.J. Springer has how much rain to expect and when the sunshine returns. Rain chances are on the rise tonight as our next system moves in. T.J. Springer has how much rain to expect and when the sunshine returns. Clouds have thickened up across the Valley ahead of our next storm system. As these areas of low pressure move in overnight, showers develop, becoming steadier. With the clouds and wind flow, temps won't drop much tonight. Lows dip back into the lower to middle 40s which is above normal for this time of year. The rain picks up in intensity early Saturday with rainfall rates possibly around 0.25-0.50\" per hour. This could lead to some minor flooding, especially in low-lying, flood prone areas. A Flood Watch has been issued from late tonight through Saturday evening for a good chunk of the Valley. Rain starts to taper off between 5-7 PM or so as this area of low pressure lifts to the northeast. The wind then becomes the headline with gusts around 40 mph. The rain and the wind have made Saturday an IMPACT DAY so be sure to stay weather aware. The wind lightens up on Sunday but it'll still be breezy as high pressure builds. Gusts early in the AM could rise near 30 mph. The plus is sunshine returns! If you have any Easter Egg hunts planned, those should go off without a hitch. High pressure remains in control into early next week with plenty of sun on Monday. Highs rebound nicely, topping out in the middle and upper 50s. The pattern turns unsettled once again though with shower chances rising Wednesday into Thursday. A system moving in from the west along with a coastal low lifting north provide the shot at moisture. Chances are looking higher on Wednesday than Thursday but it's something we'll be watching. Beyond that, Easter Weekend is looking drier. A weak clipper system could make for a few showers on Saturday but chances aren't looking great at the moment. High pressure looks to return just in time for Easter with afternoon readings back near 60 along with more sunshine. Have a great night! -T.J.",
