    "title": "'We can't change our history' on slave trade, says Keir Starmer",
    "text": "The UK \"can't change our history\", Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has told the BBC when asked about paying reparations to countries impacted by the transatlantic slave trade.\nHis comments come after diplomatic sources told the BBC that Commonwealth heads of government want to start a \"meaningful conversation\" about an issue that could mean the UK paying billions of pounds for its historical role in the trade.\nSir Keir, who is currently in Samoa for a meeting of Commonwealth countries, said the trade was \"abhorrent\" and that it was important to \"talk about our history\".\nChancellor Rachel Reeves ruled out making payments, in an interview earlier on Thursday, saying \"that's not something that this government is doing\".\nSir Keir said the focus should be on \"today's challenges\" including resilience in the face of climate change and boosting trade between Commonwealth nations.\nHe added he wanted to help member countries work with international financial institutions to \"unlock money that might help them\" in relation to climate change.\nWhat form could reparations for slavery take? UN judge: UK's £18tn slavery debt is underestimation Leaders from 56 countries are attending the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting taking place in Samoa on Friday and Saturday.\nCommonwealth leaders are expected to defy the UK and debate ways of securing reparations for historical slavery. At its height, Britain was the world's biggest slave-trading nation. Downing Street has said the issue is not on the agenda for the summit.\nReparatory justice for slavery can come in many forms, including financial reparations, debt relief, an official apology, educational programmes, building museums, economic support, and public health assistance.\nIn the run-up to the summit, there have been growing calls from Commonwealth leaders for the UK to apologise and make reparations.\nFormally opening the summit on Friday, King Charles said that members of the Commonwealth \"know and understand each other such that we can discuss the most challenging issues with openness and respect\".\n“Our cohesion requires that we acknowledge where we have come from,\" he said.\n“I understand from listening to people across the Commonwealth how the most painful aspects of our past continue to resonate.\n“It is vital therefore that we understand our history to guide us to make the right choices in the future.\n“None of us can change the past, but we can commit with all our hearts to learning its lessons, and to finding creative ways to right inequalities that endure.”\nHe also spoke of the need to tackle climate change, saying Commonwealth nations should seek to be an \"example to the rest of the world\", and paid tribute to his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, saying the group \"mattered a great deal\" to her.\nDuring the gathering, a new Commonwealth secretary general will be elected. All three of the candidates - Shirley Botchwey of Ghana, Joshua Setipa of Lesotho and Mamadou Tangara of Gambia - back reparatory justice.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday, Frederick Mitchell, the foreign minister of the Bahamas, said he believed the UK would change its stance, saying: \"It may take a while for people to come around but come around they will.\"\nMitchell has also urged the UK government to offer an apology, telling the Commonwealth gathering: \"It's a simple matter - it can be done, one sentence, one line.\"\nAsked if an apology would be offered, Sir Keir said: \"Of course, an apology has already been made in relation to the slave trade, and that's not surprising, it’s what we would expect.\"\nIn 2007, then-Prime Minister Tony Blair apologised for the slave trade. Following talks with the Ghanaian president, he said: \"I have said we are sorry and I say it again.\"\nPA Opening the summit, King Charles spoke of how the 'most painful aspects of our past continue to resonate' During the interview with the BBC, Sir Keir was also asked about a complaint Donald Trump's team has filed against the Labour Party objecting to its staff and activists volunteering for Kamala Harris's presidential campaign.\n\"I think this needs to be seen for what it is,\" the prime minister said, adding: \"It is some Labour Party members and staff in their free time campaigning.\n\"It’s happened in every election in different parts of the world. All political parties do it... I think it needs to be put in it’s proper perspective.\"\nSir Keir added that both he and Trump wanted to have a \"good working relationship\" and that the pair recently had dinner together.\nHe dismissed suggestions that his party were still adjusting to being in government, saying he had \"absolute clarity\" on his \"number one mission\" of economic growth.\nNext Wednesday Chancellor Rachel Reeves, will set out the government's tax and spending plans in the Budget.\nAhead of this Reeves told the BBC she would be changing the government's self-imposed debt rules to free up money for infrastructure spending.\nAsked about the Budget, Sir Keir said the economy barely grew under the Conservatives and that he wanted to \"clear the decks\" and \"clear up the mess\".\n\"I believe in running towards problems. If you know what the problem is, what the challenge is, every business knows this, every family knows it, run towards it and fix it.\"\nThe Conservatives have challenged Labour's argument that they created a £22bn black hole in the economy and questioned the chancellor's decision to change the debt rules.\nThe party's shadow Treasury minister Gareth Davies said \"uncertainty over additional borrowing risks interest rates staying higher and for longer.\n\"It's families up and down the country who would pay the price.”",

    "title": "No one had ever ‘beat’ Tetris. Then came a 13-year-old phenom. - Anchorage Daily News",
    "text": "Willis Gibson spent more than a half-hour on Dec. 21 commanding a seemingly endless waterfall of blocks as they shot down his screen at a faster and faster pace. Then, at the 38-minute mark, the blocks stopped. For seemingly the first time ever, a human being beat Tetris. From his bedroom in Stillwater, Okla., the 13-year-old who plays as “Blue Scuti” became the first person to drive the classic Nintendo Entertainment System game to a “true kill screen” - the term top players like Willis use to describe when the game freezes because it can’t keep up with score computations, said David Macdonald, a professional Tetris player. Willis’s achievement shattered a decades-old belief that the game was unbeatable, dogma that came into question only in recent years after an artificial intelligence program tripped the kill screen and professionals developed more efficient techniques of handling the original Nintendo controller. “No one was even remotely close to this until just a couple of years ago,” said Macdonald, who goes by the nom de guerre and produces Tetris-related content as “aGameScout.” Willis started getting into the original 8-bit NES version of Tetris as he started sixth grade at the end of summer 2021, he told The Washington Post. He had been playing a newer version with his brother on Xbox, but after seeing a YouTube video from Macdonald, he decided to try his hand at the classic edition. “I like it because it’s simple to learn at the beginning, but it’s really difficult to master,” he said of the game in which players try to organize six different shapes into unbroken rows, thus making those rows disappear, before blocks stack up to the top of the screen. In the nearly 2½ years since, Willis has emerged as one of the best players in the world. He’s won regional tournaments, and in October, placed third at the Classic Tetris World Championship - the game’s premier competition. He’s won between $3,000 and $4,000 in prize money. Willis’s mother, Karin Cox, said she’s not worried about her son overdoing it on Tetris or other video games. Willis, who estimates that he plays an average of two to three hours a day, does a good job regulating his playtime. He also has other interests, which include playing clarinet in his junior high band, riding his bike and bowling. And competitive gaming has enriched his life, his mother said. Playing Tetris is about more than breaking records and winning money. Willis has become part of the professional Tetris subculture. He’s made friends with whom he has a “friendly competitiveness.” Older players have mentored him. “The community is absolutely wonderful,” she said. Around the time Willis started playing, a software engineer created a Tetris-playing AI model called StackRabbit that made it to Level 237 before getting a true kill screen, MacDonald said. Knowing it could be done led players to pore over the game’s code to learn what might induce the game to freeze. At the same time, players were mastering a new, more efficient way to handle controllers. Willis experienced that evolution firsthand as he was entering the competitive Tetris scene. At the start, he like most other players used a control technique in vogue at the time called hypertapping, in which players tense up their fingers, allowing them to rapidly press buttons. But in the months that followed, more and more pros transitioned to a new method called the “rolling technique,” in which players use multiple fingers to repeatedly tap the back of the controller in quick succession, pressing the buttons on the front into the players’ fingers. Willis came to the conclusion that if he wanted to compete at the top levels, he would have to adopt it. In early 2022, he made the switch and started his two-year ascent to the top levels, which culminated in his game on Dec. 21. Willis was live-streaming through the gaming site Twitch where his fellow Tetris aficionados were quick to congratulate him. In the days leading up to that game, Willis had gotten close to inducing a true kill screen. About 38 minutes into the game that would rock the Tetris world, he spotted a chance on Level 156 to drop a block into a space he knew would induce a kill screen. “Please crash,” he said. But he missed the spot, and the blocks continued to zip down the screen. Then, he advanced to Level 157. A few seconds later, he dropped a blue “L” shape into the left corner, completing and evaporating a row. But instead of spitting out the next piece, nothing came, and the background music - Tchaikovsky’s “Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy” - cut out, replaced by a monotonous hum. A moment passed before Willis realized what had happened. Until then, every one of the millions and millions of human-played Tetris games had ended the same way: The blocks came too fast for the player to handle and stacked up - game over. When the realization washed over him, Willis started heaving quick, deep breaths as he put his hands to his head and his eyes grew wide. “Oh my god!” he said in a high-pitched wheeze. He slumped in his chair and then jolted forward as he bent over and held his head in his hands. The deep breaths kept coming and so did the Oh my gods. “I’m going to pass out,” he said later. After a couple minutes, his breathing slowed, returning to something approximating normal. He laughed, tossed his head back, closed his eyes and smiled. “I’m shaking so bad.” Then there was a beat or two of silence, except for the glitched-out flatline of a defeated computer.",

    "text": "El invierno está cada vez más cerca y algunas regiones de Estados Unidos podrían sufrir con mayor intensidad las inclemencias del clima como el caso del estado de Nueva York en donde se prevé una temporada invernal inusual, en parte como consecuencia del cambio climático. Los meteorólogos advierten sobre un invierno con características particulares para Nueva York como consecuencia de un periodo más cálido de lo normal e incluso con la posibilidad de nevadas que rocen el promedio histórico en algunas zonas del estado. Nueva York está siendo alterado por un inusual patrón climático que podría provocar nevadas intermitentes que se presentarán con condiciones húmedas templadas y periodos fríos provocando temperaturas que se mantendrán por encima del promedio histórico. Pero a pesar de esperar un invierno fuera de lo común para la zona, los meteorólogos anticipan que la ciudad de Nueva York tendrá acumulaciones de nieve que podrían ir de entre las 20 y 25 pulgadas, número que pese a todo estarían por debajo del promedio histórico de 29,8 pulgadas registrados entre 1991 y 2020, de acuerdo con AccuWeather. Por su parte, la Administración Nacional Oceánica y Atmosférica (NOAA) señaló en su más reciente informe publicado el pasado 17 de octubre, que el sur del estado de Nueva York, incluida la ciudad, tiene una posibilidad del 40% al 50% de sufrir temperaturas más altas de lo normal en esta temporada del año. Cabe señalar que los registros del Central Park demuestra que las temperaturas promedio para diciembre suelen ser de 33,7 grados Fahrenheit (1°C), mientras que en enero y febrero sube a 35,9 (1.6°C). Las precipitaciones suelen situarse en promedio entre las 4,38 pulgadas de nieve en diciembre, 3,64 en enero y 3,19 en febrero. Lo que es un hecho es que las diferentes agencias meteorológicas señalan que este invierno será más cálido de habitual y con nevadas menos intensas.",
