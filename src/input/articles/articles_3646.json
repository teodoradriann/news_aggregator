    "title": "2 Lowest Rated NCIS Episodes Are So Bad, They Even Beat the Appalling Reaction to Season 22's 'Out of Control'",
    "text": "NCIS has been a cornerstone of crime procedural television and has reigned for over two decades. It’s loved for the compelling cases, great characters, and storytelling. Thanks to their devoted fanbase, the show has constantly ranked as one of the most-watched series worldwide.\nA still from Gut Punch (episode) | NCIS | CBS But even NCIS , which has such a great track record isn’t immune to occasional mishaps. Most long-running shows have their highs and lows and give their fans a lot of memorable moments. But at times, they also feature episodes that leave the audience, confused, or even disappointed.\nNCIS season 22’s Out of Control episode backlash for its missteps A still from Out of Control (episode) | NCIS | CBS In the 22nd season of NCIS , Out of Control was one episode that was targeted by critics for its plot’s pacing, weird character decisions, and failed execution. When people tune in to watch the show, they expect a level of intrigue, and a character-driven story, which has been their formula for years.\nAudiences were disappointed because the case did not feel gripping, and it seemed like they gave no thought to the episode. The storyline was way below expectations and didn’t match the high standard set by NCIS.\nRelated “I have just seen more and more positive reactions”: NCIS Star Who Replaced Cote De Pablo Claimed Even Hardcore Ziva Fans Have Welcomed Her But of all, people were let down due to the way the showrunners portrayed some long-standing characters. This left a bitter taste in the viewers’ mouths, who found everything to be frustrating. But despite all these problematic issues, Out of Control has an IMDB rating of 7.4, so it still wasn’t as bad as the worst-rated episodes.\nFirst Steps and Gut Punch: Two bottom-of-the-barrel episodes on NCIS A still from First Steps (episode) | NCIS | Credit: CBS Out of Control was indeed a disappointment, but First Steps and Gut Punch are two episodes that are at the very end of NCIS rankings as per ratings on IMDB , with 6.9 for both. These episodes are so bad that no one bothered to judge or actively dislike them because they were simply that forgettable!\nFirst Steps was an attempt to bring forth an emotionally charged narrative but they faltered in the execution which felt forced and unnatural. Moreover, the whole case felt rushed and did not make sense to the viewers. By the end, fans were left unimpressed because the plot had genuine potential but it turned out to be a misfire.\nRelated 5 Most Underrated Episodes of NCIS: Los Angeles Gave Wrestling Fans a Major Surprise by Casting Famous WWE Icon Who Also Appeared in the Flash Gut Punch was even more disastrous as it tried to address real-world issues but it simply did not align with the usual tone of the show. To many, it felt like a filler episode, and the main team members being sidelined did not help either. Longtime fans who tuned in to watch some action were stuck and had to sit through someone enforcing pandemic protocols.\nYou can watch NCIS on Paramount+ .",

    "text": "Preservation efforts at the Penn Center on St. Helena Island BEAUFORT COUNTY, S.C. (WTOC) - The United States National Parks director Chuck Sams visited the Penn Center on St. Helena Island today to discuss efforts to preserve Reconstruction Era History. Sams was shown the restorations made to the Penn Center’s Darrah Hall, the Penn Center’s oldest building. The building’s restoration from stairs to shingles were made possible through the Great American Outdoors Act, which Sam spoke about as well. The Penn Center is just one of many historic landmarks in the Reconstruction Era National Historic Network, which preserves the history of the era from 1861 to 1900. “Similar to dozens of other national parks established in recent years, it is part of an effort to ensure that everyone’s story is reflected in our national story. A story that is not true and complete unless it is diverse and inclusive, and recounts stumbles, along with our great achievements,” United States National Parks Director Chuck Sams said. Sams announced five new additions to the Reconstruction Era National Historic Network across the country, which he said is incredibly meaningful during Black History Month. Those new additions are: • 1838 Black Metropolis • Buffalo Soldiers National Museum in Fort Lawton • Dark Branch Descendants Association • Fort Stanton Historic Site • Fort Union National Monument Copyright 2024 WTOC.

    "text": "Back in spring 2021, Eyewitness News\nshared the story of two sisters in Britain who were using TikTok to encourage other teens to read.\nMireille and Elodie Lee's\n\"A Life of Literature\" account has grown dramatically since then, and now they're stepping into the publishing business.\nThe Lee sisters' move to become publishers is all more remarkable when you consider Mireille is just 18 years old and Elodie recently turned 16.\nTogether they have found fame promoting the books they love on TikTok and now they are looking to deepen the connection with fans and broaden their reach.\n\"We've been building this audience together on TikTok and Instagram for a long time now,\" said Mireille to Eyewitness News entertainment reporter Sandy Kenyon.\n\"It's been an amazing experience. All of the offers that we have received have been unimaginable,\" said Elodie.\nThe sisters grew up close in Brighton, England.\n\"When we were little, we were obsessed with the library,\" said Mireille.\nThey took to TikTok early, starting \"A Life of Literature\" and encouraging their peers to read the books they love.\n\"And, our love of books is behind our new venture, Bindery,\" added Mireille.\nThe Lee sisters are part of a diverse group under the Bindery umbrella.\nBindery is the brainchild of Matt Kaye.\n\"When I saw what was happening with people like Mireille and Elodie on social media, like how many books they were selling and how passionate their audience was, I got really excited about this idea that they could do even more in the publishing world,\" Kaye said.\nHis new company is a place to interact directly with fans.\nWhat's even more exciting about the new venture is the opportunity for these influencers to become publishers.\n\"We get to give unpublished authors a bigger chance to get their books published because they're just as deserving as the other bigger authors in the industry, but they don't necessarily get that chance,\" said Elodie. \"So that's what Bindery is about and that's what everyone's trying to do on the platform.\"\nOnce a manuscript is accepted for publication, Bindery acts like a traditional publisher when it comes to editing and cover design and the like, but those who follow Mireille, Elodie and the others get to follow along as that process unfolds.\nReaders get to be a part of a book's journey to the point of sale.",

Others were seen throwing the items in a heap on fire in a street.\nBhatti said the videos were images from the scene.\nReuters could not independently verify the pictures.\nThe independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said the Christian community was \"at grave risk to their lives at the hands of the charged mobs\".\nBlasphemy is a sensitive subject in conservative Muslim- majority Pakistan, where just an accusation can lead to a street lynching.\nHuman rights groups say Pakistan's harsh blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal scores.\nWhile blasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan, no one has been executed by the state for it, though numerous accused have been lynched by outraged mobs.\nA Muslim crowd attacked a Christian community in eastern Pakistan last year, vandalising several churches and setting scores of houses on fire after accusing two of its members of desecrating the Koran.\n(Writing by Asif Shahzad; Editing by Mike Harrison)\nOpen Modal ×",

    "title": "Donald Trump, for all his flaws, made Israel’s triumph over Hamas much more likely",
    "text": "Israel’s army chief and prime minister made clear this week that Israel has only one New Year’s Resolution on the table: destroying Hamas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stressed that the ongoing operation in Gaza was “not close” to over. Tragic as this just war is, it’s a bit of a miracle that Israel can wage it for so long. And that traces back to Donald Trump. Given his utter lack of diplomatic finesse, ex-President Trump never had the look of an international peacemaker, let alone one who’d do wonders for Jews. Those of us observing from Canada or across other allied nations could never have predicted it, but it turns out the Abraham Accords negotiated under Trump have made Israel’s continued existence and gradual triumph in this new war dramatically more likely. Recall that in 2016 the new Republican administration inherited a stagnant Middle East peace scenario. Since Israel’s founding, the conflict has essentially been the story of a democratic Israel ring-fenced by antagonistic Arab states who feigned empathy for Palestinians while using them as a tool to undermine Israel’s legitimacy. These states even refused to recognize Israel’s right to exist. With the leadership of senior adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, the Trump White House tried a new “outside-in” approach to Mideast peace. The Abraham Accords are proving to be a singular diplomatic triumph for the United States, and a godsend for Israel. In August 2020, they provided for a gradual normalization of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco. They also ignited rapid improvements in strategically significant relationships between Israel and Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia — all at one time adversaries of the Jewish state. As a result, they did more than any other presidential initiative to ensure that 2023 is not a replica of the 1967 war, when Israel was attacked on multiple fronts not merely by proxy terror groups like modern day Hamas or Hezbollah, but by a coalition of recognized Arab states. Today, with the Accords in place, there’s simply too much for all sides to lose in an expansive conflict — like the 4 million new jobs and $1 trillion in new investment on the table if the accords are fully leveraged through 2030, per the Hoover Institute . Militarily, the Accords and ensuing normalization of relations have given Israel the geopolitical space it needs to prosecute a large-scale operation to crush Hamas without a greater risk of inter-state conflict. A long campaign and rising civilian death toll in Gaza may test the strength of the pacts, given strong sympathies with Palestinians in the Arab street, but, according to sources in the region, most actors seem open to continued normalization after Israel’s major campaign ends. In fact, in a sad twist of irony, it looks like the Biden administration — not the Arab states living cheek-by-jowl next to Israel — is the biggest risk to Jerusalem’s ability to prosecute its just war for as long as it takes. Biden’s secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, told Bibi on Nov. 30 that Israel doesn’t “have the credit” for a months-long war that reaches into southern Gaza. It’s unclear whether Blinken was referring to global goodwill or the willingness of the United States to support such operations, but it ultimately doesn’t matter. Blinken’s comments are a clear signal that, under President Biden, the United States will help Israel kill some terrorists, but maybe not all of them, lest it get awkward for onlookers. This is a ridiculous proposition when it’s so evident Hamas must be crushed for both Israelis and innocent Palestinians to have a shot at peace. The gradual withdrawal of US support for Israel’s just war against Hamas, sadly echoed in Canada, stands in stark contrast with the relative silence on the part of the Arab states. Before the Abraham Accords, there would’ve been antisemitic rhetoric and potentially lethal interference from these states. Their relative restraint — rhetorically, diplomatically and militarily — in the current conflict is breathtaking and novel in modern Mideast history. Canada’s foreign minister, Melanie Joly, recently articulated a vision anchored in “pragmatic diplomacy,” which boils down to engaging with enemies as well as allies, with the great risk of confusing them for one another. In contrast, by focusing on making good business deals between states, Team Trump showed what real pragmatic diplomacy means — and the massive strategic benefit it can yield for the West’s democratic friends and allies.

    "text": "News -\nMet Police officers and staff recognised in the King’s New Year Honours List\nMet Police officers and a member of police staff have been recognised in the King’s New Year honours for their achievements and exceptional service.\nCommissioner Sir Mark Rowley said: “I would like to congratulate all our colleagues who have been recognised in the King’s New Year Honours List for their remarkable achievements. These awards are hugely deserved and very special; I hope that the recipients and their families and loved ones take great pride in them.\n\"The awards reflect a variety of contributions across different aspects of policing in London and beyond. From preventing and investigating terrorism and knife crime, to leading large-scale ceremonial and sporting events and promoting inclusion and equality across our organisation; this is a snapshot of our exceptional people. I am incredibly impressed and proud of their extraordinary service to the communities of London and beyond.”\nThe recipients are:\nExplosives Officer Mick Kettle - Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE).\nAwarded for his work in the UK and abroad as an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) operator.\nDetective Inspector Rasheed Alawiye – British Empire Medal (BEM).\nAwarded for developing and championing diversity and inclusion initiatives across the Met.\nCommander Karen Findlay - King’s Police Medal (KPM) and Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order (LVO).\nAwarded for successfully delivering and co-ordinating the policing operation for The State Funeral of Her Majesty The Queen and high-profile events and public order operations.\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Ward – King’s Police Medal (KPM).\nAwarded for delivering the Birmingham Commonwealth Games policing plan with West Midlands Police, improving police legitimacy and inclusion, and his work in Counter Terrorism.\nDetective Chief Inspector Matthew Gosling – King’s Police Medal (KPM).\nAwarded for leadership in response to counter terrorism and national security threats in the UK, including threat to life and national security investigations at national level.\nDetective Chief Superintendent Hayley Sewart – King’s Police Medal (KPM).\nAwarded for her role in transforming the national knife crime portfolio.\nDetective Inspector Amanda Stephenson – King’s Police Medal (KPM).\nAwarded for her work as a Family Liaison Officer (FLO).\nSergeant Nicholas Birch – Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO).\nFor service in royalty and specialist protection.\nDetective Constable Kevin Malkin - Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO).\nFor service in royalty and specialist protection.\nSergeant Elizabeth St Clair - Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO).\nFor service in royalty and specialist protection\nDAC Matt Ward joined the Met in April 2023, having previously worked at West Midlands Police for over 27 years. Matt led the policing and security operation for the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games. Matt is also one of the national leads for the Police Race Action Plan which aims to improve policing for Black people and he is passionate about making policing an anti-racist organisation.\nDAC Ward said: \"I’m incredibly humbled to receive this award but I also feel a bit like an imposter because success in policing is always about the team and not the individual. Throughout my career I’ve been very fortunate to work with some incredible teams and many exceptional colleagues, first in West Midlands Police and now as a proud Met officer. I want to thank the countless officers, staff and family members whose support and friendship sits behind this honour.”\nCommander Karen Findlay has more than 13 years’ experience delivering challenging high-profile events and public order operations. As gold commander, Karen was responsible for the successful delivery and co-ordination of the policing operation for the State Funeral for Her Majesty The Queen.\nShe was also recognised for her efforts in championing diversity and building relationships with young people and policing; and her role representing Scotland’s women’s rugby team, as player, captain and coach.\nCommander Findlay, said: “I am deeply honoured and humbled to receive these special awards. It is a lovely unexpected surprise. Having transferred south of the border from Grampian Police in 1993 to the Met, I have over the last 30 years had the privilege of working with many amazing people who have given me support, advice, encouragement and friendship. None more so than within public order policing. To lead the Met through the policing operations for the The State Funeral for Her Majesty The Queen and Their Majesties' Coronation will always remain the privileges of my life.”\nDetective Chief Superintendent Hayley Sewart has played a pivotal role in transforming the national policing knife crime portfolio since she joined in 2017. She pioneered a new approach to tackle knife crime in the Met and reduce serious violence by creating Op Sceptre; initially a locally delivered operation which focused on periods of action to tackle knife crime across the capital. This has since been rolled out nationally and achieved fantastic results.\nDCS Sewart said: “I’m surprised and thrilled to receive this award. It’s also recognition for the small team of volunteers and the working group who have supported me over the last few years.”\nMick Kettle has dealt with the most complex terrorist bombs in very demanding circumstances requiring him to always put the safety of others before his own. He has promoted and lectured on safe explosive ordnance disposal internationally, including deployments to Oman, Bahrain, Singapore and the USA. Prior to joining the Met Police he spent 25 years as an ammunition technician in the British Army, achieving the highest level of qualification in improvised explosive device disposal.\nDCI Matthew Gosling has led the police response to numerous counter terrorism and national security related threats over the last six years. His work has been vital in saving lives and protecting UK national security. This includes leading the response to national threat to life operations and national security investigations.\nDI Rasheed Alawiye developed a campaign for meaningful cultural change and instigated action across the Met Police to debate inclusion, diversity and equality by developing ‘Discussions Matter’ a series of videos that brought together officers and staff from different backgrounds where personal experiences of diversity; addressing uncomfortable topics in a way that was authentic, respectful, informative and productive.\nDI Alawiye said: “I’m honoured, proud and humbled by this nomination. It’s a nod to the brave individuals within the diversity and inclusion groups that I’ve been involved in over the years, and the leaders that have afforded me the time to pursue this work. Policing is great, I think we all just want the public to see that.”\nDI Amanda Stephenson was one of the first Family Liaison Officers (FLO) in the UK and has served in this role since 1997. This valuable role has impact both on investigations, but more importantly on the trust and confidence of the public. She has supported the victims of tragedies including 9/11, the Bali Terrorist Attack and the Grenfell Tower fire. Amanda is also a crisis negotiator, a mentor and a mental health campion.\nDI Stephenson said: “This area of policing is tragic and sad but my role has allowed me to assist families by providing a direct line of communication to and from the investigation team. I am extremely honoured and humbled to be recognised for this work, but totally appreciate the amazing teamwork involved in all of these incidents.”\n+ If you would like to make a difference by fighting crime and serving communities, consider a rewarding career as a Met police officer.
