    "text": "SALEM, Ore. — Portland General Electric (PGE) customers will see a 17 percent increase starting Jan. 1, 2024. The decision was first announced in October. The rate of the increase was not decided until December by PGE and Oregon Public Utility Commission (PUC) pending the final power supply forecast, officials say. PGE and PUC officials claim the increase is due to multple factors such as the Faraday Resiliency and Repowering hydroelectric project, resilience and reliability upgrades in transmission and distribution systems, increased costs of the vegetation management program to help ensure the safety and reliability of the system, and inflation. “The rate increase reflects the need to invest in the reliability and resiliency of PGE’s system, advance policy objectives like equity and clean energy, and the reality that PGE faces inflationary pressures and high market power prices,” said Megan Decker, PUC Chair. “We recognize how significant this rate increase will be for families and businesses, and we encourage them to seek out help with bills through energy efficiency and the rate discount program that has been expanded to better support Oregonians experiencing low incomes.” Another contibuting factor is the PUC’s approval of an annual adjustment for power supply costs, which is a pass-through cost of PGE purchasing power to meet customer demand. Officials say this adjustment resulted in an increase in customer rates due to power costs rising sharply and increasing in volatility in the Western electricity market, accoridng to PUC. The exact amount customer bills will increase differs based on customer type and energy usage. View the impact for each customer type below: These include the approval of stipulated agreements among the parties on two major PGE rate filings – an annual adjustment for power supply costs and a general rate case filing - as well as other smaller filings submitted by PGE. These decisions, combined with the final power supply forecast, led to a high increase for PGE customers effective January 1, 2024.",

    "title": "Interfaith Couples Can Marry Under Special Marriage Act Without Need Of Conversion: Allahabad High Court",
    "text": "The Allahabad High Court has observed that the law does not prevent an interfaith couple from applying for court marriage under the Special Marriage Act without the requirement of converting their religion. A bench of Justice Jyotsna Sharma observed thus while granting protection to a live-in couple who had moved the court seeking a direction to restrain opposite parties from interfering with their life, liberty and privacy. The petitioners argued that without converting to the faith/religion of the other, they decided to cohabit as husband and wife and get married under the Special Marriage Act soon. It was also their case that they faced threats from respondents, so they could not move freely. They further argued that they cannot diligently pursue their matter of getting married under the provisions of the Special Marriage Act unless protection is granted to them. Their specific stand before the Court was that they wished to continue to follow their own faith/religion, did not propose to convert, and were mature enough to make decisions regarding their lives. On the other hand, the standing counsel submits that the petitioners mentioned in the petition that they had already gotten married as per the marriage agreement; however, such marriage is not recognised in law, and therefore, no protection can be given. In response, though the court clarified that marriage through agreement is invalid in law, the Court said that the law does not prevent the parties from applying for court marriage under the Special Marriage Committee without conversion. Given this, the court granted protection to the couple. It however, directed the couple to “show their bonafide” by taking steps to solemnize their marriage under the provisions of the Special Marriage Act and filing documentary proof thereof with the supplementary affidavit. The matter will be heard next on July 10.",

Tomara que ela vença\", declarou ele. Durante a festa da Líder Beatriz, Wanessa contou para Yasmin que os dois namoraram na adolescência, quando a cantora tinha apenas 15 anos. A sister lembrou do relacionamento ao ouvir a música \"Ela não está aqui\", sucesso do KLB.

    "title": "Missing piece on aircraft prompts Boeing to ask airlines to inspect all 737 Max jets | National | wkow.com",
    "text": "(CNN) — Boeing has asked airlines to inspect all of their 737 Max jets for a potential loose bolt in the rudder system after an airline discovered a potential problem with a key part on two aircraft. An unnamed international airline found a bolt with a missing nut in a rudder-control linkage mechanism while conducting routine maintenance – and it found a similar bolt that wasn’t properly tightened in a yet-to-be delivered plane. An airplane’s rudder is used to control and stabilize the aircraft while in flight. Boeing said the plane with the missing bolt was fixed, but it wants to ensure all 1,370 737 Max planes in service worldwide are checked for similar problems. “The issue identified on the particular airplane has been remedied,” a Boeing spokesperson said in a statement. “Out of an abundance of caution, we are recommending operators inspect their 737 Max airplanes and inform us of any findings.” Boeing informed the Federal Aviation Administration, which said Thursday that the inspection involves looking for “a possible loose bolt in the rudder control system.” The task takes about two hours, according to the FAA, and airlines will report progress of their inspections to the regulator. Boeing said the repair involves removing an access panel and visually validating the nuts and bolts. Boeing will perform the inspection on all new aircraft going forward. The FAA said it would “consider additional action based on any further discovery of loose or missing hardware.” The part in question is a critical safety item, for which the FAA requires double inspection. That means two sets of eyes must sign off that it is ready for flight. Boeing’s engineering and quality problems have [posed major challenges](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/09/business/boeing-headquarters-move/index.html) for the company. The crashes of two of 737 Max jets that [killed all 346 people](http://www.cnn.com/2019/03/10/africa/ethiopian-airlines-crash-boeing-max-8-intl/index.html) on board the flights led to a crippling [20-month grounding](http://www.cnn.com/2019/03/13/politics/donald-trump-boeing-faa/index.html) of the plane. It also was one of the most expensive corporate tragedies in history, costing Boeing more than [$20 billion](http://www.cnn.com/2021/03/10/investing/boeing-costs-737-max-crisis/index.html). The Max returned to the air carrying passengers in most markets around the globe beginning in [late December 2020](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/29/business/boeing-737-max-return/index.html). But it has encountered other problems, including in April when Boeing said it has discovered a manufacturing issue with some [737 Max aircraft](https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/12/business/boeing-737-max-ethiopian-airlines/index.html) after a supplier used a “ [non-standard manufacturing process](https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/14/business/boeing-737-max-problems/index.html)” during the installation of two fittings in the rear fuselage – although Boeing insisted the problem did not constitute a safety risk. The Max has faced numerous notices for additional inspections since it returned to service. Boeing says that’s a result of its increased focus on safety, but a missing nut on a crucial system cannot be explained away, noted CNN safety analyst David Soucie. “If the airplane left the factory with this missing part, it indicates the past three years of safety culture improvements and improved inspections on critical safety of flight systems at Boeing isn’t working,” Soucie said. Boeing has faced problems, delays and financial charges for just about all of its other passenger jets too: The FAA [flagged quality problems](https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/30/business/boeing-faa-inspection-787/index.html) with the company’s 787 Dreamliners, leading Boeing to temporarily halt deliveries last year. Though the Dreamliner was not grounded like the Max, it still hurt the company’s bottom line. Boeing has faced [massive operating losses](https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/25/investing/boeing-results/index.html) in [recent quarters](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/25/business/air-force-one-boeing-loss/index.html) as it tries to deliver the huge backlog of 737 Max planes to customers and racks up cost overruns on other planes, including the aircraft that will replace the [current Air Force One jets](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/25/business/air-force-one-boeing-loss/index.html).
