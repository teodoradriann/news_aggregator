    "title": "‘Never distracted by politics’: Richard Hermer’s surprise appointment as attorney general",
    "text": "Richard Hermer’s appointment has been widely welcomed as a breath of fresh air. Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/Shutterstock When asked a few years ago to name the three qualities a lawyer should have, one of the attributes the new attorney general for England and Wales, Richard Hermer KC, chose was “compassion”. It is difficult to imagine Suella Braverman, who held the role for just over a year until September 2022, championing the same trait, her short reign having driven many lawyers to despair, given her previous attacks on judges, and her advice that the UK could pass a Brexit bill that breached international law. As a result, the surprise appointment of Hermer, a distinguished human rights lawyer from outside the world of politics, to the role within the government of all the talents has been widely welcomed as a breath of fresh air. Geoffrey Robertson KC, a founder of Doughty Street chambers, Hermer’s first London set, said: “It is an advantage to have a fully fledged lawyer in the attorney general’s position, who’s had a career that has never been distracted by politics – that has been a problem with former attorney generals. He’s got the law at his fingertips, and his advice would be careful and correct. I think he will guide government action within the parameters of the law.” Hermer, 55, joined Doughty Street in 1993, three years after it was set up, having completed his pupillage in Wales, where he grew up. He attended Cardiff high school before studying politics and modern history at Manchester University and qualified for the bar in 1993. At Doughty Street he got to know another of its founder members, Keir Starmer, and when Hermer was made a KC in 2009, it was the future prime minister who gave the toast at his silk ceremony. They have a close relationship and when Starmer ran for Labour leader, Hermer donated £5,000 to his campaign. Philippe Sands, a founding member of Matrix chambers, where Hermer moved after Doughty Street, said: “He and Keir know each other well so there’s a very high level of trust. Is he the kind of person who can say to his friend: ‘Sorry, prime minister, the law doesn’t allow you to do that’? Yes, absolutely. “One test might be to take Iraq in February 2003. Can I imagine Richard Hermer signing off on the legality of the use of force against Iraq in those circumstances? No. He will, I think, adopt a position that is grounded in a decent and reasonable interpretation of the law. And he will, I think, have no hesitation, despite their friendship and collegiality going back many years, of indicating what can and cannot be done in accordance with the law.” Hermer goes into government, as a life peer in the House of Lords, having regularly acted against Labour and Tory ministers in landmark cases in the country’s highest courts. They include everything from multiple claims relating to the “war on terror” to the policy of restraining children in detention. His chambers profile says he was instructed by the family of a British soldier murdered by the IRA in 1991 in a challenge to the Northern Ireland (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023, which Starmer has pledged to abolish. He has criticised the illegality of the Rwanda bill in a podcast and, in the same 2020 Times interview in which he listed compassion as a key attribute, he said if he could enact a law it would be the “European Union (Please Can We Come Back?) Act”. His track record is unlikely to endear him to the likes of Braverman, but former Tory attorney generals Victoria Prentis – his immediate predecessor – and Dominic Grieve, praised him when contacted by the Guardian. Among the issues in his in-tray will be the Gaza war, with some taking his appointment over Emily Thornberry, who had shadowed the role since 2021, as a sign that Labour will take a stronger stance towards Israel after alienating many voters over the issue during the election campaign. Last October, Hermer, who attends Alyth synagogue in north-west London, was one of several high-profile Jewish lawyers, alongside Sands, to say, in a letter to the Financial Times, that Israel had a right to self-defence but must be guided by the law in its response to the Hamas attack. In an interview on LBC the same month he said it was “almost impossible to conceive of how a siege that deprives a civilian population of the basic necessities of life … is in compliance with international law.” Hermer, who was appointed a high court judge in 2019, advised Labour on a bill designed to ban public bodies from boycotting other countries, motivated by the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement in relation to Israel. Hermer said the bill, which was not passed before the election and is unlikely to be reprised, would have “a profoundly detrimental impact on the UK’s ability to protect and promote human rights overseas”. His BDS analysis prompted a Jewish Chronicle story after he had been accused of taking “political” positions on Israel-Palestine. He responded by saying the report wrongly suggested he was “somehow influenced by some form of malign intent towards Israel”, whereas he was from a “Blue-Box” Jewish family, actively supported a range of Jewish and Israeli organisations and had “dear family members currently serving in the IDF”. Lord Wolfson, a former Tory justice minister who has known him for years, said he disagreed with Hermer on many matters, and was concerned by a Guardian report that the Labour government is expected to drop a bid to delay the international criminal court (ICC) reaching a decision on whether to issue an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza. But Wolfson said that whatever the positions taken by Hermer “he’ll be acting in good faith. That doesn’t mean that I’ll think he’s right.” He added: “The position of attorney general is where the legal rubber hits the political road, and it takes someone of real principle to discharge the job properly and I’m sure he will.” Hermer will also have to deal with three cases pending at the international court of justice (ICJ) – on Palestine, the right to strike, and state obligations with respect to climate change – in which Sands said the positions adopted by the Sunak government were “dismal” and put Britain in the margins. Sands said he would be looking out for whether there would be changes in position, adding: “It is hard to imagine Richard Herman, as attorney general, standing before the ICJ and making or defending the previous government’s arguments.” Robertson said the only question mark against Hermer was his lack of criminal experience, which would necessitate greater reliance on the director of public prosecutions (a role previously held by Starmer). Outside work, the new attorney general was variously described as engaging and fun company over a drink and down to earth. Martyn Day, the founder of human rights law firm Leigh Day, has known Hermer for 26 years, having become his “go to barrister” after he instructed him in a case against tobacco companies related to lung cancer. He said Hermer was true to his word about compassion when it came to clients and was a pleasure to spend time with. Day said his friend’s appointment had caused a “massive hole in my diary”, already leading to the cancellation of dinner together and a joint trip to the Test match on Friday but his social life’s loss was the country’s gain “It is the most impressive appointment within the legal world that I’ve seen,” said Day. “He really is a man of integrity. I think we as a nation can thank Keir Starmer for such an innovative decision to bring somebody totally outside politics into what is quite a critical post.”",

    "text": "EN SU 19ª EDICIÓN\nCinco jóvenes científicas, premiadas por el programa L'Oréal-Unesco\nEstas investigadoras han sido premiadas por sus avances en cáncer, salud mental, nanomedicina y evolución humana en el 25º aniversario del programa L'Oréal-UNESCO For Women in Science.\nPublicidad\nEl programa L'Oréal-UNESCO \"For Women in Science\" ha celebrado en el Teatro Real de Madrid la 19ª edición de sus Premios a la Investigación en España. Estos galardones, dotados con una beca de 15.000 euros para cada proyecto, forman parte de este programa que cumple 25 años en España.\nEl objetivo de los galardones es reconocer el liderazgo femenino y, concretamente, el talento joven en el ámbito científico.\nEl evento ha contado con la clausura institucional de Diana Morant, ministra de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, que ha subrayado \"la apuesta del Gobierno de España por los investigadores e investigadoras como nunca en la historia\" y se ha referido a las científicas galardonadas como \"nuestro mejor talento\". \"El talento femenino hace que la ciencia tenga una mirada más amplia y genera rentabilidad y productividad económica\", destacó.\nLas científicas están liderando investigaciones revolucionarias en todo el mundo, pero aún enfrentan una clara desigualdad: solo representan el 33,3% del personal investigador a nivel global y menos del 4% de los premios Nobel en ciencia han sido otorgados a mujeres. En Europa, apenas el 11% ocupa cargos de liderazgo en investigación.\nAvances contra el cáncer\nAlrededor de 10 millones de personas fallecen a causa del cáncer en el mundo, más de 100.000 en España. El tumor de páncreas es difícil de tratar por su rápido avance y la baja eficacia de las terapias actuales. Una razón es que el tumor se vuelve muy compacto y retiene líquidos, lo que impide que los medicamentos lleguen bien. Alejandra González (Madrid, 1985), del Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Aragón (IISA), ha resultado premiada por su investigación de cómo hacer el tumor de páncreas menos denso estimulando temporalmente los vasos linfáticos, para facilitar el paso de fármacos y mejorar su efecto.\nCarolina Villarroya (Zaragoza, 1987) ha sido otra de las premiadas. Esta investigadora, del Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa (CSIC), busca nuevas inmunoterapias contra el cáncer a partir de una clave: los tumores suelen tener células con un número anómalo de cromosomas. Su objetivo es entender cómo el sistema inmunitario puede reconocer estas células para diseñar terapias más precisas.\nPor su parte, Isabel Abádanes (Guadalajara, 1992), de la Universidad de Valencia, trabaja en nanosistemas basados en MOFs, materiales porosos avanzados que permiten liberar medicamentos directamente en células tumorales y eliminar contaminantes del agua. Usa una técnica innovadora llamada modulación multivariante para dar múltiples funciones a un mismo material.\nMicrobiota y nuevos antidepresivos\nEn los últimos años se ha descubierto que los microorganismos que viven en nuestro intestino —la microbiota intestinal— pueden influir en nuestra salud mental, afectando trastornos como la depresión o la ansiedad.\nAna Castells estudia el vínculo entre la microbiota intestinal y la depresión, con el objetivo de desarrollar nuevos tratamientos.\nEl proyecto de Ana Castells (Madrid, 1985), investigadora del Instituto de Investigación biomédica de Girona, busca entender mejor cómo actúan algunos de estos compuestos sobre el cerebro y como pueden repercutir en el desarrollo y progresión de la depresión. El objetivo final es desarrollar nuevos tratamientos, como preprobióticos o postbióticos que puedan ayudar a prevenir o aliviar los síntomas de la depresión.\nEn busca de nuestros orígenes\nMarta Pina (Huesca, 1987), investigadora del Institut Català de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont, es otra de las galardonadas y lidera el Proyecto Nakali en Kenia, centrado en el estudio de fósiles de hace casi 10 millones de años.\nMarta Pina investiga sobre un posible ancestro común de humanos y grandes primates en un yacimiento fósil de Kenia.\nEste yacimiento ha revelado restos de un nuevo primate, Nakalpithecus nakayamai, que podría ser un ancestro común de gorilas, chimpancés y humanos. Su investigación busca entender cómo vivía esta especie y qué nos puede contar sobre la evolución de nuestros propios orígenes.\nL'Oréal-UNESCO \"For Women in Science\"\nCreado en 1998 y con presencia en más de 110 países, el programa \"L'Oréal-UNESCO For Women in Science\" ha reconocido desde sus orígenes a más de 4.100 científicas, como las españolas Margarita Salas y Ángela Nieto, así como a siete ganadoras de un Premio Nobel, como Katalin Karikó o Jennifer Doudna, entre otras.\nLa versión nacional de estos premios, con los que L'Oréal y la UNESCO destacan desde hace 19 años las investigaciones de cinco jóvenes científicas en España, ha impulsado en total a 92 ganadoras que han recibido ayudas por valor de más de 1,4 millones de euros.\nPublicidad",

    "text": "Las fuerzas rusas capturaron y mataron al menos a 29 líderes religiosos desde que comenzó la guerra en Ucrania: funcionario Soldados y funcionarios de ocupación rusos han cometido al menos 76 actos de persecución religiosa en Ucrania desde la invasión de febrero de 2022 como parte de un intento de destruir la identidad nacional, dijeron fuentes oficiales y eclesiásticas en la Cumbre Internacional de Libertad Religiosa. Desde la invasión, los cristianos evangélicos, incluidos los bautistas, pentecostales y adventistas del séptimo día, han sufrido mucho, dijo el comisionado del Parlamento para los Derechos Humanos en Ucrania, Dmytro Lubinets, a los participantes en la cumbre, que tuvo lugar en Washington, DC, el martes y miércoles. “El ejército ruso ha amenazado repetidamente con la eliminación física total de todos los creyentes evangélicos, llamándolos espías estadounidenses, sectarios y enemigos del pueblo ortodoxo ruso”, dijo Lubinets en una mesa redonda el martes. \"Para matar a una persona, para demoler una iglesia, los rusos hacen todo lo posible para destruirnos como nación\". Citando los 76 casos de persecución desde la invasión, Lubinets dijo que soldados y funcionarios rusos han matado o capturado al menos a 29 clérigos o líderes religiosos en Ucrania desde febrero de 2022, y agregó que esta cifra representa solo los casos verificados, y el número real es mucho mayor. Además de detenciones arbitrarias, violaciones, torturas y amenazas de asesinato, dijo, “los ocupantes simulan tiroteos y amenazan con ejecutar a miembros de la familia. Estas personas están detenidas en condiciones inhumanas, sin agua ni comida, e incluso sin acceso a un baño”. Mykhailo Brytsyn, pastor en Ucrania hasta que los soldados rusos irrumpieron en un servicio de adoración y cerraron su iglesia, dijo que todas las iglesias en las ciudades ocupadas por Rusia están cerradas. \"La mayoría de los sacerdotes y pastores como yo hemos sido amenazados, intimidados, humillados, detenidos, golpeados y deportados\", dijo el pastor Brytsyn a los participantes de la cumbre. “Algunos sacerdotes y creyentes todavía se encuentran hoy en las cárceles rusas. Algunos de ellos fueron asesinados”. Lubinets dijo que una de las primeras cosas que hacen los soldados rusos cuando capturan una ciudad es destruir los edificios de las iglesias, “excepto uno, y también obligan a todos los ciudadanos a ir a ella”. En noviembre de 2022, un diácono de una iglesia evangélica y su hijo fueron encontrados muertos a tiros en una zona forestal de la parte ocupada por Rusia de la región de Kherson, pocos días después de haber sido secuestrados por soldados rusos, dijo. “En agosto de 2023, los rusos atacaron la parroquia católica romana de Skadovs'k en la región de Kherson”, añadió Lubinets. “A los feligreses se les dijo que se trataba de una operación antiterrorista especial. Hay muchas historias de este tipo”. Desde febrero de 2022, Rusia ha dañado o destruido más de 600 edificios religiosos, incluidos los de comunidades protestantes, judías, católicas y musulmanas, afirmó. \"El mayor número de edificios religiosos destruidos se encuentra en los territorios temporalmente ocupados de las regiones de Donetsk y Lugansk\", dijo Lubinets. Un informe de noviembre de la Iniciativa de Libertad Religiosa de Mission Eurasia, EE.UU., encontró que la invasión provocó daños en al menos 630 estructuras religiosas, incluidas 206 casas de oración evangélicas. Entre las bases ideológicas de los ataques rusos contra objetivos religiosos se encuentra el objetivo de destruir una cultura ucraniana que ahora se enorgullece de la libertad de religión y los valores democráticos, afirma el informe. Después de que estalló el movimiento separatista respaldado por Rusia en 2014, “las figuras religiosas ucranianas y la mayoría de las comunidades religiosas en las regiones de Donetsk y Luhansk controladas por Rusia sufrieron una persecución brutal”, afirma el informe. \"La única excepción fue la Iglesia Ortodoxa Ucraniana, afiliada al Patriarcado de Moscú, que gozaba de inmunidad ya que apoyaba a los separatistas controlados por Rusia\". Los funcionarios de ocupación rusos percibieron a los miembros de la Iglesia Ortodoxa de Ucrania, la Iglesia greco-católica ucraniana y las iglesias evangélicas como agentes enemigos y espías de los servicios de inteligencia ucranianos o estadounidenses, afirma el informe. En febrero-marzo de 2022, los soldados rusos estaban preparados para perseguir a los seguidores religiosos. “Los propagandistas rusos comenzaron a acusar a figuras religiosas ucranianas de organizar una resistencia armada”, afirma el informe. “Sacerdotes y pastores fueron acusados infundadamente de cooperar con el Servicio de Seguridad de Ucrania, almacenar armas, transportar explosivos o convocar a un levantamiento armado contra las autoridades de ocupación”. Viktor Zelenskyi, jefe del Servicio Estatal de Ucrania para Asuntos Étnicos y Libertad de Conciencia ante el Consejo de Ministros, dijo a los participantes de la Cumbre de la IRF que la invasión rusa de Ucrania provocó atrocidades como el asesinato de sacerdotes, pastores, imanes y sus esposas. “Cuando pregunté a los pastores que fueron perseguidos en la región de Kiev durante los dos meses de ocupación del territorio de Kiev por qué los soldados rusos estaban tan enojados y eran tan brutales con los lugares religiosos, uno dijo: 'Odian la libertad, y realmente odian las libertades; no pueden sobrevivir'. cuando la gente pueda orar libremente'”, dijo Zelenskyi. La Iglesia Ortodoxa Rusa y su Patriarca Kirill no son sólo herramientas de la agresión rusa sino participantes, dijo. “El patriarca Kirill no sólo bendijo a los militares contra Ucrania, sino que dijo abiertamente que le gustaría destruir la identidad ucraniana, le gustaría destruir la cultura ucraniana, el idioma ucraniano y le gustaría borrar todas las escenas de guerrillas y militares, [que ellos] ser asesinado en Ucrania durante la llamada operación militar especial”, dijo Zelenskyi. “Me di cuenta completamente y creo que el Patriarca Kirill es uno de los mayores criminales culpables de [la muerte de] mártires, culpable de todas estas violaciones de los derechos humanos y la libertad religiosa en Ucrania”. El pastor Brytsyn, director de la Iniciativa de Libertad Religiosa de Mission Eurasia, dijo a los participantes en la cumbre que mientras continúe la ocupación rusa de territorios ucranianos, aparecerán nuevos casos de persecución religiosa. \"Donde está Rusia no hay libertad alguna\", afirmó. \"Creo que la libertad religiosa volverá a los territorios ocupados sólo cuando sean liberados y devueltos bajo el control del gobierno ucraniano.\" Este artículo fue [publicado originalmente](https://www.christiandaily.com/news/russian-religious-persecution-takes-aim-at-ukrainian-identity.html) por Christian Daily International.",
