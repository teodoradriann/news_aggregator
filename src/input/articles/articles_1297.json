    "text": "I almost forgot how much I love snow until my weekend trip to Vermont. No, it's not fun to shovel or drive in, but darn it, it is incredible to channel your inner kid, get on a sled and speed down a hill until you are afraid that you might not possibly stop.\nYou know what isn't fun? That's having to walk back up the hill to get another turn. I think even small hills should have ski lifts that get you up a mountain. I would be out there all day if I didn't have to trudge uphill through the snow after every ride. You might as well have put heavy ankle weights on me.\nAnd sure, I am sore in some tender places, but it was worth it to escape for a moment and take in a nice wintry day in a small-town New England town that, yes, reminded me of one they would shoot a Hallmark Christmas movie in. And no, I didn't get any of that script written during my trip. Let's dive into some ramblings.\nAdvertisement - The great Jay Tate wrote about this after Auburn defeated Texas A&M, but this team can win in multiple ways, which is different from years past. If you got Auburn into a heavyweight battle, slowed the tempo down and held the Tigers to limited possessions in recent years, you had a great chance to win. That's not the case this year.\n- I saw an exit sign for Southern New Hampshire University and couldn't believe my eyes. The college that appears on my television screen 20 times a day has an actual campus? Who knew?\n- Jaylin Williams has reached another level of play so far this season, and it is good to see. If he continues this up, he deserves to be rewarded with All-SEC team honors. Oh, and the improvement of Dylan Cardwell has been great to see.\n- As I have often made clear, I am a massive The Sound of Music fan. Did my older sister make me watch it continually? Yes. Have I been on the movie tour in Salburg, Austria? Of course. Did I get most of the trivia answers correct on said tour? Absolutely. So, when I saw that the von Trapp family has a brewery in Vermont, I had to sample their product. It was delicious. Also, the family has an Austrian-inspired resort in Stowe, VT, that I must visit immediately.\n- Well, I was safe from blindside tackles for a short period, but Crime Dawg is back on the Plains, and that's a great thing for Auburn. He is one of the elite recruiters in college football, and the kids trust him. The standing ovation he received in Friday's team meeting tells you all you need to know. Combine him with Charles Kelly, and Auburn is in business.\n- (Amish rant incoming) I was watching a D.W. Documentary called The Lives of the Amish in the U.S., and there's no way these people are real. They speak too well and have too much camera presence. Unreal. It's like that old show Amish Mafia that turned out to be fake. I've said it before, and I'll continue saying it forever: you can't trust the Amish.\n- Good on Auburn fans for showing up in droves for the upset against LSU on Sunday in Neville Arena. That could be a season-changing win for the team. Also, Kim Mulkey scares me.\n- Much as they were in Georgia back in the day, the exits in Vermont are not based on the mile marker but on the number of exits it is. Why do states do this? It makes no sense. Get your crap together!\n- It would take a lot for me to sit in the weather Kansas City had last night for its football game for even my favorite things.\n- Calvin Coolidge was born in Vermont. I learned that driving through and realized I couldn't tell you one thing Coolidge accomplished in office. I looked him up; I should have known some of that. My high school sophomore U.S. History teacher will be upset if he reads this.\n- It is strange that along the interstates in New England, signs warn people of incoming winter weather and encourage them to plan ahead. Is that necessary? These people know where they live. It's like driving down I-85 in August and seeing a sign that says, \"It Might Be Hot Today.\"\n- K.D. Johnson continues to be a menace on defense this season, and I'm here for all of it. His energy has been non-stop.\n- We don't know how the running back room will work out, but the possibilities are limitless for that group. It will be hard for Hugh Freeze to get all of those guys touches.\n- Alabama hiring Kalen DeBoer could end up working out for the Tide. Still, we are all aware of what sometimes happens when you hire a coach from the Pacific Northwest with no ties to the Southeast, especially after your top three candidates say no.\n- Finally, since I'm still officially in New England as I type, I will go ahead and rank the states in this part of the country.\n6. New Hampshire - A less cool Vermont with traffic for absolutely no reason.\n5. Rhode Island - Throwback, but t hese guys are from the state . That is all you need to know.\n4. Massachusetts - With all apologies to Daniel Locke, your state is 99 percent jerks.\n3. Connecticut - The coast is excellent. Hartford is not.\n2. Vermont - Laid-back, friendly people to whom I feel akin.\n1. Maine - Go to Maine in July or August. Trust me on this. It will change your life. Also, LOBSTER!!!!\ntrending {{ article.title }} premium-icon\n{{ timeAgo(article.live_at) }}",

    "title": "NEW: Kariba water inflows surpass last year’s level",
    "text": "The Sunday Mail Online Reporter WATER levels in Lake Kariba had by Tuesday this week had risen above last year’s levels owing to increased rainfall activity in the catchment area, raising prospects for increased allocation for power generation for both Zimbabwe and Zambia. In a post on its X handle on Wednesday, the Zambezi River Authority (ZRA), which manages water in the river on behalf of the two riparian states, said the water level was measured at 477,35 metres on January 2, compared to 475,6 metres in the same period a year ago. “The lake level is rising due to increased rainfall activity on the lake and immediate catchment, closing the period under review at 477,25m (12,11 percent usable storage) on 2nd January 2024, compared to 475,63m (0,97 percent usable storage) recorded during the same date last year,” said ZRA. Last week, the authority announced that the Zimbabwe Power Company and Zambia’s ZESCO Limited would equally share 16-billion cubic metres (BCM), down from the revised 30 BCM in 2023, because of anticipated poor inflows from the lake’s catchment area.",

    "text": "Fu un massacro eseguito con inimmaginabile ferocia quello di Vinca, il 24 agosto del 1944. Domani, ottant’anni dopo, la cerimonia che rinnoverà quell’infinito dolore e di cui l’assessore regionale Alessandra Nardini sarà oratore ufficiale. Le lacrime tornano a inumidire gli occhi degli abitanti del paese che ricordano mentre raccontano nel docufilm di Michelangelo Ricci presentato mercoledi sera in paese. Il maggiore Walter Reder, comandante del 16° Reparto Esplorante, la sera del 23 agosto durante una festa al Circolo Ufficiali di Carrara dov’era stato invitato quale \"ospite di riguardo\", chiese e ottenne dal colonnello Ludovici delle Brigate Nere di Apuania la disponibilità di un centinaio di militi in supporto alle sue SS per partecipare, all’alba del giorno successivo, a una vasta operazione per snidare e distruggere le formazioni partigiane presenti, a dire degli ufficiali nazisti, nella Vallata di Vinca.\nFu lo sterminio di una popolazione inerme. Il “monco”, come veniva soprannominato il maggiore Reder per l’avambraccio sinistro perso nella campagna di Russia, all’alba del 24 agosto con un’imponente massa di soldati, a cui s’erano uniti i militi della Brigata Nera d’Apuania, mosse all’assalto del paese all’ombra del Pizzo d’Uccello. Una carneficina che durò tre giorni: vennero uccise 174 persone, quasi tutte donne, bambini e anziani. Tre giorni di apocalisse a Vinca: SS e Brigate Nere, al suono di un organetto distrussero ogni forma di vita che trovarono sulla loro strada, stuprarono e sventrarono donne, usarono bambini per un ignobile tiro al bersaglio e poi diedero fuoco al paese.\nE domani, nell’80° anniversario, l’eccidio di Vinca sarà ufficialmente ricordato dalle autorità dopo tre giorni del festival “Vincanta - La memoria che resiste” organizzato dal gruppo che sta portando avanti progetto per far rivivere il paese nel segno della pace e dell’arte. L’appuntamento è alle 9 nel paese di Gragnola per la deposizione di una corona al Monumento ai Caduti in piazza della Stazione; alle 9,50 il raduno in piazza a Vinca con il sindaco e le autorità; alle 10 la messa al cimitero del paese e alle 11 l’orazione ufficiale dell’assessore regionale della Toscana, Alessandra Nardini. Poi la visita al Monumento del Mandrione.\nRoberto Oligeri",

    "text": "Minimum wage workers can expect a slight pay increase on January 1. Here in Central New York, minimum wage is going up to $15 an hour. 80 cents more than what employees earn now. Some business owners tell CNY Central that still doesn’t feel like enough. At Parthenon Books in downtown Syracuse, workers are paid a little more than the current [$14.20 minimum wage pay.](https://dol.ny.gov/minimum-wage-0) Still, managers there wish they could do even more. “As a small business it’s hard for me to make that work,” said Selena Giampa, the store manager at Parthenon Books. “But it’s important to me because as opposed to a larger company, my employees are what makes my business go and so if I can give them slightly more than that and ensure that they’ve got food, and transportation and rent, then they’re better employees for me overall.” Right now, employees working a full 40 hours on minimum wage earn about $568 weekly. Or $29,536 for the year—before taxes. With an increase to $15 an hour, that yearly salary before taxes, becomes $31,200. “When you work at minimum wage, you often have more than one job to make ends meet,” said Giampa. “If you have children, it’s even more. You tend to go without a lot of things people take for granted.” Bruce Block is the owner of Antique Underground. He agrees that $15 next year is a step in the right direction. However, it’s still far off from a livable wage. Especially as the costs to live continues to increase. “If you think of the costs of things in our society and everything now, it’s not a lot of money,” said Block. “There’s certain things that have gone up proportionately much more like housing and cars and food and things like that and I don’t even know but certainly a family can’t live on $15 an hour.” In some cases, businesses are expected to offset the extra pay for employees onto consumer prices; by reducing labor, or perhaps finding other ways to make cuts to a budget. “In today's world, little businesses are suffering the most,” said Block. The newly established rates will continue to increase by 50 cents in 2025 and 2026 statewide.",

Former Lib Dem leader Kennedy represented Ross, Skye and Lochaber until 2015. He died shortly after losing his seat. MacDonald’s constituency was the very last to be declared due to the returning officer ordering a recount, with the results being announced on Saturday morning. The former army officer is a businessman and author as well as being a Highland councillor. He told the PA news agency he was hopeful of a win despite polls suggesting the seat would stay in SNP hands. He said: “Not one single poll had the SNP losing, and quite a few had me behind Labour and the Conservatives.” At about one o’clock on election night “the SNP’s mood went from being buoyant to being dejected” as the vote counting process suggested the Lib Dems were ahead, he said. The returning officer’s decision meant the constituency, which stretches from Skye in the west to Inverness in the east, would not be formally declared until Saturday. But MacDonald said the result was clear at that point, saying: “The fact is, Drew Hendry conceded on the first night… “There was an assumption amongst almost everybody that I had won.” Hendry, who had been an MP since 2015, said it had been an “absolute joy” to represent those in the area. In his concession statement, he said: “I am obviously disappointed not to be continuing that representation under the new Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire boundary and wish the new MP every success in his new role. “People need an MP who will fight for their needs both local and at UK level and during this cost-of-living crisis, they have never needed help and assistance more.” Charles Kennedy’s son Donald was supportive of MacDonald’s campaign, providing him with a quote for campaign leaflets as he sought to regain the area for the Lib Dems after nine years. The new MP said: “The family were extremely pleased. “There was no doubt at all that they felt it was great it had been reclaimed for the Liberal Democrats.” He wore full highland dress, including his family MacDonald of Keppoch tartan kilt to the election count – an outfit he plans to sport again at the state opening of Parliament next week. MacDonald said there is “elation” in the Lib Dems after they took 71 seats across the UK and he will focus on improving transport and infrastructure in the Highlands. After being sworn in at Westminster he said the building was “awe-inspiring”, adding: “I’m incredibly pleased and honoured to be part of it, I must be one of the luckiest people in Britain.” STV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News Follow STV News on WhatsApp Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country",

    "title": "L’eolico offshore aumenta i rischi per le balene: uno studio solleva preoccupazioni",
    "text": "La crescente espansione dell’ energia eolica offshore potrebbe comportare nuovi rischi per le balene . Questo è quanto emerge da uno studio condotto da Ocean Conservation Research e presentato alla Conferenza della Acoustical Society of America. L’installazione di pale eoliche nelle acque costiere, insieme ai lavori preparatori, sta sollevando preoccupazioni sull’impatto che tale attività potrebbe avere sulla vita marina. In particolare, i cetacei , tra cui le balene e i delfini, sono sensibili ai rumori e al traffico marittimo aumentato causato dai lavori di costruzione dei parchi eolici.\nNel periodo invernale del 2022-2023, si è registrata una tragica sequenza di eventi al largo della costa del New Jersey , dove quasi una dozzina di balene sono morte in prossimità di aree sotto valutazione per la realizzazione di parchi eolici offshore. Tuttavia, secondo la Marine Mammal Commission, un’agenzia di controllo federale degli Stati Uniti, non ci sono prove che colleghino la morte delle balene nello specifico con lo sviluppo dell’ energia eolica . Le autopsie delle balene recuperate hanno indicato che molte di esse sono morte a causa di collisioni con navi.\nLa Marine Mammal Commission ha affermato che “ questo non è un evento particolarmente insolito, né il numero di balene morte in questo periodo è superiore alla media “. Nonostante ciò, Michael Stocker, autore dello studio e membro di Ocean Conservation Research, ha espresso preoccupazione sul fatto che la crescente presenza di navi da ricognizione nelle acque del New Jersey, connesse alla costruzione dei parchi eolici, possa aver aggravato la situazione. Stocker ha infatti dichiarato: “ Gli impatti con le navi sono stati solo una coincidenza? O sono stati il prodotto di una vigilanza sulle balene compromessa a causa di fattori di stress aggregati? “.\nLe navi da ricognizione, utilizzate per mappare il fondale marino in preparazione alla costruzione dei parchi eolici, impiegano dispositivi acustici sottomarini che possono causare stress ai mammiferi marini. Mentre Stocker riconosce che una singola nave da ricognizione potrebbe avere un impatto limitato, ha sottolineato che “ 11 diverse indagini sono state operative nella regione da dicembre 2022 a marzo 2023 “, e che “ l’impatto cumulativo di queste indagini non è stato valutato correttamente “.\nLo studio solleva quindi importanti interrogativi sulla necessità di una valutazione più approfondita degli effetti combinati di queste attività industriali sulla fauna marina, e sulle misure di protezione da adottare per mitigare i rischi per le balene e altri cetacei.",

    "title": "Helena nonprofits, schools take action to help homeless during cold snap",
    "text": "As most of Montana braced for sub-zero temperatures this weekend, Helena’s local nonprofits, schools and community members are working to ensure that the needs of the city’s homeless population are being met. According to the National Weather Service, Helena this weekend will see [ low temperatures](https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=46.58976 7&lon=-112.02064 ) in the -20s and -30s; the highs are not much warmer. On Friday afternoon the temperature, adjusted to include wind chill, was -39 degrees in Helena. Theresa Ortega, director of Good Samaritan Ministries, said that the non-profit organization is working with God’s Love, Helena’s existing emergency shelter, to ensure that those in need get a warm place to stay. “We help get people out of the cold. We help create different alternatives other than people being in the cold and being in a vulnerable situation. We also work with God’s Love and at times when they got an overflow we’ve been there to try and help them out as well,” Ortega said. “Good Samaritan will be there for a backup for anyone that’s in need of a place to be out of the cold weather.” Ortega also shared that the [recently approved emergency women’s shelter ](https://montanafreepress.org/2023/12/19/helena-city-commission-approves-location-for-homeless-shelter/)is not yet ready for operation. God’s Love accepts both men and women into its shelter. The shelter provides 24 beds for men and seven for women and also provides an overflow area that can fit up to 40 people. Thursday night, 26 people stayed overnight in the shelter’s overflow area. Our Place, a day resource center for homeless people managed by Good Samaritan Ministries, will be open on Saturday in response to the weather, according to a staff member. The Friendship Center, a non-profit group whose mission is to help create a safe place for individuals seeking refuge from domestic violence, staffs a 24-hour hotline at 406-442-6808 that can help people find a hotel if needed. Helena Public Schools, which stayed open on Friday, is also mobilizing to help students in the district who are experiencing homelessness and rely on school meals. Michele Zentz, the school’s homeless liaison, said that the district is offering hotel stays for families with children for up to three days. Zentz also said that some staff members are personally delivering meals to students who couldn’t get to school on Friday. According to Zentz, 368 students in the district are experiencing homelessness, which passed last year’s record of 356 students. The school district defines homeless students as those who share housing, live in hotels, or live in trailers or at campsites. Some community members are taking action into their own hands in helping provide food and other necessities to families. Amy Adams, along with a few of her family members and friends, started making and delivering meals to families living in hotel rooms, campers or RVs last winter and has been delivering food since. “I’m not an organization. I’m just a community member who saw a need and is trying to do what I can to help fill and meet it,” Adams told Montana Free Press. “This needs to be brought to the attention to the community because there is only so much the school district can do.” Adams said she does need more help in her volunteering and can be contacted at [amys.mess@yahoo.com](mailto:amys.mess@yahoo.com).
