    "text": "Pope to Christian Associations of Italian Workers: 'Be a voice of peace' By Lisa Zengarini Pope Francis on Saturday met with the Christian Associations of Italian Workers (ACLI) as they celebrate the 80th anniversary of their foundation in 1944. Commitment to making a difference in society Addressing some 6,000 members of the organization in the Paul VI Hall, the Pope warmly commended their decades-long commitment to solidarity in the service of workers, pensioners, young people, migrants and all the people in need, but also of the cause of peace. “The ACLI ,\" he noted , \"are a place where it is possible to meet the ‘saints of next door’, who don’t hit the frontpages but sometimes actually make a difference for the better.” The Pope then focused his reflection on five distinctive features of their “style” of work . The first is their “popular” style, that is “not only being close to the people”, but also “feeling part of the people.” A popular style “A popular style implies recognizing that great social projects and lasting transformations arise from below, from shared commitment and collective dreams”, he said. “But the true essence of the people lies in solidarity and a sense of belonging”, which, the Pope remarked remarked, is so much needed today “in our fragmented society and individualistic culture.” Working together with people from different backgrounds The second feature Pope Francis mentioned is the ACLI’s the synodal style. Working together with people from different backgrounds collaborating for the common good is “fundamental”, he remarked, encouraging the ACLI to continue this path with a special attention to the weakest in society, so that “no one is left behind.” Commitment to the values of democracy and peace The Pope then recalled that loyalty to the principles of democracy and the protection and promotion of human rights is another distinctive feature of the ACLI. The Pope noted that for a society to be truly democratic, everyone should have a place. This is why, he noted, the support they provide to those who risk marginalization - young people, women, vulnerable workers and migrants and elderly and pensioners is so important. Pope Francis also praised the ACLI for their active commitment to the cause of peace: “In a world marked by conflicts and divisions,” he said, “your testimony as peacemakers, as intercessors for peace, is more necessary and precious than ever.” Adopting a Christian style Finally, Pope Francis recalled the Christian inspiration of the ACLI which permeates their commitment to serving workers, peace and to promoting the dignity of all people. In the face of “cultural visions that risk cancelling the beauty of human dignity and tearing society apart”, concluding Pope Francis encouraged the Christian Associations to continue their service to the community and “to cultivate a new dream of fraternity and social friendship.” Thank you for reading our article.

    "text": "Dublin is a safe city when compared with others in the western world, the Taoiseach has insisted.\nLeo Varadkar said while it is important to acknowledge and listen to the experiences of those who have fallen victim to crime in Dublin, he insisted such incidents are not the norm for Ireland’s capital.\nThere has been an increased focus on safety in Dublin following a series of well publicised random attacks and assaults on people in the city.\nThat scrutiny intensified after the events of November 23, when rioting broke out in the city centre following a knife attack on three young children and their care assistant outside a primary school.\nTaoiseach Leo Varadkar made the comments during his end of year media briefing (Niall Carson/PA) Opposition parties claim a reduction in Garda numbers has contributed to a situation where parts of the city are no longer safe. It is a charge the Government has rejected.\nMr Varadkar was asked about the issue of safety in Dublin at his end of year media briefing with political journalists.\n“There’s no city that’s 100% safe,” he said.\n“If you look at something like the murder rate, for example, in Ireland or Dublin, compare that to other countries or other major cities, you’ll see that Dublin and Ireland are relatively safe relative to other countries and other cities in the western world.\n“But there’s no place that’s 100% safe and I acknowledge that. What I say to people is that we’re taking actions in all of these areas, increasing Garda numbers and Garda resources, making our laws tougher, with tougher sentences in particular, appointing more judges, expanding our prison places.\n“(There is) also a big focus now on community safety partnerships, because it can’t be all just about a law and order response. Other things are important too, including things like street lighting, like cameras, like engaging with different services around addiction and mental health and so on. That’s the approach that we’re taking.”\nA burned out bus is removed from O’Connell Street in Dublin in the aftermath of violent scenes in the city centre on November 23 (Brian Lawless/PA) Asked how he responded to accounts from individuals who have been assaulted in the capital, the Taoiseach added: “Of course I am concerned about individual negative experiences that people have in Dublin or anywhere else. That’s something you’re very aware of and very exposed to as a politician.\n“Somebody would have maybe a very bad experience of our health service. But I’m also aware of the counterfactual or the other sides of the story, if you’d like, the huge number of people who have a very positive experience of our health service, for example and say so when surveyed.\n“The same thing applies to people coming into town, coming into our cities and coming into our country.\n“Most people, thankfully, don’t experience being victims of violent crime in Dublin or anywhere else.\n“While it’s really important that we listen to and acknowledge the stories of people who have a very bad experience, we have a responsibility as politicians and journalists not to make the mistake of thinking that bad experiences are the majority or are the norm.”",

After an injury-battered Bills defense came up short in Round 2 last year, the team set about a retooling effort that featured more notable changes on the other side of the ball. [Josh Allen](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/search/search.fcgi?pid=AlleJo02,AlleJo00&search=Josh+Allen&utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-21_pfr) has a new-look receiving corps. For the first time since his ascent to superstardom, the do-it-all QB will not be targeting [Stefon Diggs](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DiggSt00.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-21_pfr). Additional Bills moves centered on cap-based adjustments, with a few longtime starters — some longer in the tooth, others who had dealt with injuries — also out of the picture. As a result, curiosity surrounds Sean McDermott‘s team and perhaps the eighth-year HC’s status. But the Bills still have Allen and many key pieces from their early-2020s stay atop their division. While they should still remain a factor in the Super Bowl chase, plenty of eyes will be on this team as it reshapes its blueprint to reach its long-sought-after goal. Trades: - Acquired 2025 [second-round pick from](https://www.profootballrumors.com/2024/04/bills-to-trade-wr-stefon-diggs-to-texans)Texans for WR [Stefon Diggs](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DiggSt00.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-19_pfr), No. 189, 2025 fifth-rounder - Obtained No. 144 [from Bears for](https://www.profootballrumors.com/2024/03/bills-trade-ol-ryan-bates-to-bears)OL [Ryan Bates](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BateRy02.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-19_pfr) [As difficult as it appeared Diggs was for the Bills to manage at points, his 2020 arrival played a pivotal role in Allen catapulting toward his current place in the game. The 2018 first-round pick took a seminal step in Diggs’ debut, and the former Vikings draftee became one of the NFL’s most consistent pass catchers in Buffalo.](https://cdn.profootballrumors.com/files/2024/04/USATSI_22354782-scaled.jpg) The Allen-Diggs tandem produced three straight 1,200-plus-yard seasons, with Year 1 doubling as Diggs’ lone first-team All-Pro showing. The elite route runner also displayed durability for a Bills team that shuffled through second bananas in the passing game, missing only one contest in four seasons. Though, last year brought some concerning signs. Diggs, 30, struggled down the stretch, averaging only 41 yards per game and scoring just once over the Bills’ final 10 contests; Joe Brady‘s offense did not coax the nine-year veteran’s best work. Diggs’ 1,183-yard season brought speedbumps and produced a brutal final act — dropping a well-placed Allen deep ball late in another narrow January loss to the Chiefs. Diggs’ sudden production decline came a year after he stormed out of Buffalo’s locker room following a one-sided loss to Cincinnati. During the 2023 offseason program, Diggs left the Bills’ facility unexpectedly — before McDermott called the confusing matter, which may or may not [have stemmed from](https://www.profootballrumors.com/2023/06/bills-wr-stefon-diggs-reportedly-frustrated-by-role-in-offense-input-in-play-calling) the wideout’s role in the offense, [“very concerning.”](https://www.profootballrumors.com/2023/06/sean-mcdermott-stefon-diggs-issue-resolved) A year later, Diggs will be asked to help the Texans develop [C.J. Stroud](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/StroCJ00.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-21_pfr). [A report pointed to the Texans including a 2025 second-rounder as changing Buffalo brass’ mind on retaining the WR. That said, this trade brought a non-QB record for single-player dead money ($31.1MM). That full amount is on the Bills’ 2024 cap sheet. Considering what it cost the Bills to trade their top target, it clearly did not take too much convincing on the Texans’ part. Indeed, an April report indicated Diggs’ antics had worn thin and Bills higher-ups ](https://cdn.profootballrumors.com/files/2024/04/USATSI_19115599-scaled.jpg) [were ready to move on](https://www.profootballrumors.com/2024/04/texans-offer-changed-bills-stefon-diggs-plan). Ultimately, Diggs (zero TDs with Brady at the controls) [expected to be traded](https://www.profootballrumors.com/2024/06/texans-wr-stefon-diggs-expected-to-be-traded-by-bills) for a second time. The Texans had pursued [Keenan Allen](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/A/AlleKe00.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-21_pfr); they needed to give the Bills more than the Bears sent the Chargers. Houston curiously [removed the final three seasons of](https://www.profootballrumors.com/2024/04/texans-to-remove-final-three-seasons-from-stefon-diggs-contract) Diggs’ Bills-constructed extension — four years, $96MM — in a reported effort to better motivate the veteran playmaker. That odd decision will put Diggs on track for free agency come March, barring an extension before that point. Diggs exiting western New York with four years remaining on his contract injects uncertainty into the Bills’ equation, as Allen’s age-28 season does not seem likely to include a true No. 1 receiver. Allen has obviously displayed tremendous growth since his rocky pre-Diggs years, but his team has an issue to sort out soon. Playing on a Bears-designed contract for the past two seasons, Bates is now part of that team. The Bills matched the Bears’ RFA offer sheet during Ryan Poles‘ first offseason running the NFC North franchise, but after using Bates as a starter in 15 games in 2022, they demoted him upon adding guards [Connor McGovern](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/search/search.fcgi?pid=McGoCo00,McGoCo01&search=Connor+McGovern&utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-21_pfr) and [O’Cyrus Torrence](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/TorrOC00.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-21_pfr). Bates worked strictly as a backup last season; the 27-year-old blocker is vying for Chicago’s starting center role while giving the team an option at right guard. Extensions and restructures: - Extended LT [Dion Dawkins](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DawkDi00.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-19_pfr)for three years, $60.06MM ( [$30.21MM guaranteed](https://www.profootballrumors.com/2024/03/bills-to-extend-lt-dion-dawkins)) - Reached three-year, $30.75MM ( [$16.65MM guaranteed](https://www.profootballrumors.com/2024/03/bills-to-extend-cb-taron-johnson)) extension with CB [Taron Johnson](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JohnTa01.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-19_pfr) - Moved to restructure QB [Josh Allen](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/search/search.fcgi?pid=AlleJo02,AlleJo00&search=Josh+Allen&utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-19_pfr)‘s contract, [creating $16.7MM in cap space](https://www.profootballrumors.com/2024/03/nfl-restructures-mahomes-chiefs-allen-knox-bills-broncos-browns-martin-cowboys) - Agreed to restructure with DE [Von Miller](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MillVo00.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-19_pfr), [clearing $8.65MM in cap space](https://www.profootballrumors.com/2024/03/bills-restructure-de-von-miller-cb-rasul-douglas) - Opted to restructure TE [Dawson Knox](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/K/KnoxDa00.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-19_pfr)‘s contract, [creating $6.7MM in cap room](https://www.profootballrumors.com/2024/03/nfl-restructures-mahomes-chiefs-allen-knox-bills-broncos-browns-martin-cowboys) - Adjusted C [Connor McGovern](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/search/search.fcgi?pid=McGoCo00,McGoCo01&search=Connor+McGovern&utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-19_pfr)‘s contract, clearing [$3.74MM in cap room](https://www.profootballrumors.com/2024/03/nfl-restructures-saints-ward-mcgovern) - Restructured CB [Rasul Douglas](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DougRa00.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-19_pfr)‘ deal, freeing up $2.5MM [in cap space](https://www.profootballrumors.com/2024/03/bills-restructure-de-von-miller-cb-rasul-douglas) [More attention surrounded the players the Bills lost this offseason, but the team paid two core performers. Dawkins is the longest-tenured Bills left tackle since Jim Kelly– and Doug Flutie-era blindsider John Fina. Only Fina (131) and 1970s and ’80s LT bastion Ken Jones (130) have served longer in this role. Carrying 106 career starts, Dawkins will have a chance to top this list during the 2025 season. ](https://cdn.profootballrumors.com/files/2024/08/USATSI_22128523-scaled.jpg) [Cordy Glenn](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GlenCo00.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-21_pfr)‘s LT successor has made the past three Pro Bowls, anchoring an O-line that has seen changes come to pass everywhere else during his eight-year tenure. Pass block win rate placed Dawkins fourth overall among tackles last season, and Pro Football Focus has ranked him outside the top 25 among tackles only once (2018). Dawkins, 30, has also avoided injuries. A second-round pick during the draft McDermott and Doug Whaley shepherded (one that also produced [Tre’Davious White](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WhitTr01.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-22_pfr) and [Matt Milano](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MilaMa00.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-22_pfr)), Dawkins has been one of the team’s catalysts during this rise. This third contract should include more prime years for the Temple product, who is now the NFL’s sixth-highest-paid LT. Given Dawkins’ stability, the Bills having him at this rate represents good value. Coming into the offseason, the slot cornerback market had stagnated. Neither Johnson nor [Kenny Moore](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MoorKe03.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-21_pfr) were able to score deals beyond where 2010s All-Decade slot [Chris Harris](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/search/search.fcgi?pid=HarrCh01,HarrCh20&search=Chris+Harris&utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-21_pfr) went ($8.5MM AAV) during the 2014 season. Both current AFC slot staples finally elevated the market to eight-figure-per-year territory. Moore re-signed with the Colts at three years and $30MM; Johnson topped that days later to become the league’s highest-paid inside corner. The Bills CB’s guarantee at signing also narrowly topped Moore’s $16MM figure, which is impressive considering the latter hit free agency. [During Johnson’s second contract, the Bills have seen their outside corners struggle to either stay healthy (](https://cdn.profootballrumors.com/files/2024/08/USATSI_18817821.jpg) [Tre’Davious White](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WhitTr01.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-21_pfr)) or justify a first-round investment ( [Kaiir Elam](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/E/ElamKa00.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-21_pfr)). Johnson, meanwhile, has anchored Buffalo’s CB corps during the 2020s. PFF gave the 2018 fourth-rounder a career-best grade last season, ranking him 17th among all corners, and his 7.4 yards per target figure was his best mark since his rookie season. Johnson also forced three fumbles in 2023. As the Bills transition from White, they will need Johnson (28) to keep delivering top-shelf work inside. Miller’s status loomed as tenuous during a season in which he was clearly hampered by a second ACL tear. The year ended with the future Hall of Famer being arrested on a third-degree felony charge of assaulting a pregnant person. Both Miller and the alleged victim, his girlfriend, [denied a crime occurred](https://www.profootballrumors.com/2023/12/von-miller-domestic-violence-allegations-100-false). An NFL suspension would void Miller’s remaining guarantees — $8.5MM for 2024. After this year, no guaranteed money remains on a deal that has not worked out the way the Bills hoped. Nothing has come out in 2024 regarding any potential punishment for the 35-year-old edge rusher, and the Bills restructuring the deal firmly keeps Miller in their plans. The former Broncos and Rams superstar [said he is 100% healthy](https://www.profootballrumors.com/2024/07/bills-von-miller-healthy-ahead-of-2024-season); he is now nearly 21 months removed from the knee injury that ended his 2022 season — a promising campaign that featured eight sacks in 11 games — and sidetracked his 2023 slate. Miller played in 12 games, starting none, last season and did not resemble the dominant sack artist the Bills signed for $20MM per. The team will hope the 14th-year vet has another rebound season in him, as it lost [Leonard Floyd](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/F/FloyLe00.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-21_pfr) in free agency. Due to this restructure, the Bills would take on $15.4MM in dead money if they released Miller next year.

Thus far, Allen is the only QB who has emulated Mahomes by signing an extension longer than five years. The six-year pact Allen signed runs through 2028, and like Mahomes’ deal, Allen’s has extended space for base-to-bonus restructures. The Bills took advantage of that flexibility in March. The Bills will need to address this matter in the not-too-distant future. With five more seasons on the contract, the team can sit tight for now. As is the case with Mahomes and the Chiefs, however, the QB carries significant leverage due simply to his franchise-elevating skillset. It will be interesting to see if the seventh-year passer uses it soon, especially when factoring in the run-game role the former No. 7 overall pick has taken on — only two QBs ( [Lamar Jackson](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/search/search.fcgi?pid=JackLa00,JackLa02&search=Lamar+Jackson&utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-22_pfr) and [Cam Newton](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/N/NewtCa00.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-22_pfr)) have logged more carries through six seasons — thus far in his career.

[Samuel, 28, worked with Brady during the latter’s first season as Carolina’s OC. The former second-round pick eclipsed 600 receiving yards in each of the past two seasons, profiling as more of a slot/gadget weapon than an outside option. ESPN’s Open Score metric rated Samuel as a bottom-20 wideout last season, but the Ohio State alum is known for short-area production. However, the Bills relied on Shakir in this role late last season. It will be interesting to see how the team uses the third-year player and veteran FA addition together.](https://cdn.profootballrumors.com/files/2024/03/USATSI_22171829-scaled.jpg) A Chiefs cap casualty, Valdes-Scantling drew interest from multiple teams. He struggled for most of last season before making some crucial contributions — including two long-range grabs against the Bills — in the playoffs.

Set to turn 31 in September, Hollins has surpassed 250 receiving just once in his seven-year career. It would be odd for the Bills to give Hollins a key role, but he appears a roster lock.

Armstead took a big Jaguars offer, reuniting with ex-49ers GM Trent Baalke. Buffalo added Johnson at a much lower rate. Johnson, 30, spent the past two seasons with the Chargers.

The former second-rounder has started just four games and has never topped 41% usage on defense. With Miller a wild card, the Bills will need Epenesa to unlock another level.

With Jones out of the picture for much of last season, the Bills dropped from fifth to 15th against the run from 2022-23. Edwards at $3MM per represents a borderline steal. Prior to a concussion-marred 2022 and working as a Bills swingman on a near-veteran-minimum contract last year, Edwards started every game for the Super Bowl-winning Rams. The former fifth-round pick also moved into Los Angeles’ starting lineup under now-Bills O-line coach Aaron Kromer. PFF ranked Edwards as a top-30 guard in 2020 and ’21; for what it’s worth, the advanced metrics site graded his 194 2023 snaps immaculately, ranking no guard higher.

Like Bakhtiari, White’s injury woes lingered to the point he could no longer live up to his contract. The Bills, who chose White after picking up an extra first-rounder from the Chiefs in the 2017 Mahomes swap, received good value early.

A bigger loss comes elsewhere in the secondary. The rare seven-year starting safety duo, Hyde and Poyer — part of McDermott’s first Bills free agency class — were instrumental in the team snapping a 17-year playoff drought and becoming an AFC power. Given midlevel deals as first-time free agents in 2017, each signed a more lucrative contract.

[Both players are now 33; the Bills certainly received their prime years. The initial Hyde and Poyer pacts represent top-flight free agency steals, and the Bills never needed to venture into eight-figure AAV territory to extend either. Both overdelivered.

He has posted between nine and 10.5 sacks each year from 2020-23 and tallied between 18-22 QB hits each season.

While Epenesa (soon to be 26) is six years younger, the Bills will take a risk by losing a durable, dependable edge. Of course, having Miller and Oliver’s contracts on the books present some limitations. [Buffalo’s 2019 Morse addition also overlapped with the team’s Beane-McDermott-era climb, as the former Kansas City second-rounder elevated his game to become a dependable Dawkins sidekick up front. Morse made a Pro Bowl and only missed six games in that five-year span. The Bills gave him two deals around the same rate (four years, $44.5MM and then a two-year, $19.5MM pact in 2022). That said, the Mizzou alum has sustained six documented concussions as a pro.

The Utah product has not gotten much practice work in due to an early-camp injury, but plans will still be in place for him to team with Rapp. Edwards and [Damar Hamlin](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HamlDa00.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-22_pfr) are not signed for 2025. A second-team All-Pac-12 safety in 2023, Bishop was strong against the run (21.5 career tackles for loss) and as a blitzer (7.5 sacks in three Utes seasons). He will have big shoes to fill in coverage, however, with few teams possessing the capabilities the Bills recently had at safety. Carter earned first-team All-ACC acclaim last season but was more productive in 2022, when he registered 5.5 sacks and tallied 11 TFLs. Carter also posted 4.5 sacks in 2021, and he was consistently disruptive at the line of scrimmage. The 302-pounder batted down 11 passes from 2021-23.

Brady’s offense leaned more on the run game, and while Allen did not curb his turnover issue following Ken Dorsey‘s firing, the Bills did fare better in the win column with the former Panthers OC calling the shots. The Bills have ranked as a top-six offense in each of the past four years, owing more to Allen’s prodigious talents than the play-caller. Considering the Bills ](https://cdn.profootballrumors.com/files/2024/01/USATSI_19104286-scaled.jpg) [only interviewed one other candidate](https://www.profootballrumors.com/2024/02/2024-offensive-defensive-coordinator-search-tracker) — Buccaneers QBs coach Thad Lewis, satisfying the Rooney Rule — they did not appear interested in ditching another OC. Forcing out Leslie Frazier and calling the shots in 2023, McDermott is considering [handing the play sheet to Babich](https://www.profootballrumors.com/2024/05/sean-mcdermott-bills-dc-bobby-babich-to-receive-look-as-play-caller). The younger of two Babiches to work for the Bills in recent years, Bobby drew DC interview requests from the Dolphins, Giants and Packers. Babich has been on the Bills’ staff since 2017, being Hyde and Poyer’s position coach for four seasons before coaching linebackers over the past two. Father Bob Babich, a former NFL DC, had coached Buffalo’s LBs from 2017-21. The production of Buffalo’s safety tandem, along with Milano’s 2022 All-Pro season, garnered Babich interest elsewhere. The Bills have routinely put up high defensive rankings in the regular season, being in the top four in scoring four times since 2019, before crumbling in the playoffs. Last season’s undoing — against a Chiefs offense that had been oddly shaky all season — may have been less on the coaches, as injuries sidelined roughly half the team’s starting defense. This included Milano, who missed most of last season with a severe leg injury. Despite making it back in time for training camp, the All-Pro LB faces another lengthy rehab timetable due. [Milano’s biceps injury may not keep him out all season, but even if he returns late, the Bills are not getting much return on their recent extension (two years, $28.33MM). The 2017 fifth-rounder turned 30 this offseason, and although no guarantees are on his deal beyond 2024, a 2022 restructure will make it pricey to move on next year. It would cost the Bills $17.2MM in dead money (while generating no cap savings) to cut Milano in 2025. The team has its top linebacker signed through 2026, but the converted safety is no longer dependable. ](https://cdn.profootballrumors.com/files/2023/03/USATSI_19608549-scaled.jpg) [Dorian Williams](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WillDo04.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-22_pfr), a 2023 third-rounder, will have the first shot at replacing him [as a three-down player post-Dodson](https://www.profootballrumors.com/2024/08/latest-on-bills-lb-situation-following-matt-milano-injury). While Rousseau only totaled five sacks last season, he set career-highs in TFLs (12) and QB hits (18). The 2021 first-rounder ranked 41st in pressures as well and has batted down four passes in each of his three seasons. The Bills will continue to work with the Miami alum, who is now their top edge rusher with Floyd gone and Miller’s form uncertain.

Buffalo does return a strong offensive line and has [James Cook](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CookJa01.htm?utm_medium=linker&utm_source=www.profootballrumors.com&utm_campaign=2024-08-22_pfr) on a rookie deal through 2025, providing some cover for the superstar QB. The two agonizing divisional-round losses to the Chiefs have provided a roadblock, denying Super Bowl-caliber teams. Buffalo has continued to respond from postseason defeats well, earning No. 2 seeds in 2022 and ’23. More questions abound regarding the Bills’ capabilities this year, and the team will need to navigate the Dolphins once again and what should be (QB health permitting) a more imposing Jets outfit. Allen and his remaining veteran supporting cast still make the AFC East run through Buffalo, but the margin for error — both in the division and in the AFC — should probably be considered slimmer this year due to the events of this offseason.
