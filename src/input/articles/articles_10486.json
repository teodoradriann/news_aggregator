    "text": "Pop superstar Katy Perry and broadcasting veteran Gayle King will swap microphones for spacesuits as part of the first all-female crew to venture beyond Earth’s atmosphere since 1963. Jeff Bezos‘ aerospace company, Blue Origin, announced Thursday that the two celebrities will join a historic six-woman team aboard the NS-31 mission, scheduled to launch in spring 2025. According to Variety, this groundbreaking flight marks the first entirely female crew to cross the Kármán line since Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova’s solo journey more than six decades ago.\nThe mission’s roster also includes several other accomplished professionals: Bahamian-American aerospace engineer and former NASA scientist Aisha Bowe; civil rights activist and Rise founder Amanda Nguyen; film producer Kerianne Flynn; and helicopter pilot Lauren Sánchez, who is engaged to Blue Origin founder Bezos.\nVideos by PopCulture.com\nKing, the 70-year-old CBS Mornings co-host, shared her mixed emotions about the upcoming adventure during Thursday’s broadcast. “I don’t know how to explain being terrified and excited at the same time. It’s like how I felt about to deliver a baby,” she said, adding that she consulted both her children and longtime friend Oprah Winfrey before committing to the spaceflight.\nSánchez, who authored the children’s book The Fly Who Flew to Space, was instrumental in assembling the crew. Blue Origin’s announcement credited her with having “brought the mission together,” stating she “is honored to lead a team of explorers on a mission that will challenge their perspectives of Earth, empower them to share their own stories, and create lasting impact that will inspire generations to come.”\nThis will be Blue Origin’s 11th human flight and 31st mission overall for its New Shepard program, named after Alan Shepard, the first American to reach space in 1961. The suborbital experience lasts approximately 10 minutes and reaches an altitude exceeding 62 miles – the internationally recognized boundary between Earth’s atmosphere and outer space. By comparison, the International Space Station orbits approximately 250 miles above Earth.\nThe upcoming flight continues Blue Origin’s tradition of including notable personalities on its missions. Previous passengers have included Star Trek actor William Shatner, who at 90 became the oldest person in space until Edward Dwight broke that record this year at the same age. Good Morning America co-host Michael Strahan was also among the celebrities who experienced brief weightlessness aboard New Shepard.\nBezos himself participated in the company’s first crewed flight in 2021, demonstrating confidence in his fully reusable vehicle. The experience can be profoundly moving for participants – Shatner later wrote in his autobiography that the journey triggered “among the strongest feelings of grief I have ever encountered,” according to Variety. While no specific launch date has been announced beyond spring 2025, the mission marks an important milestone in space tourism and female representation in aerospace.",

    "text": "Metros With the Most Music Festivals Within a One-Hour Drive Fifty-odd years ago, Michael Lang, Artie Kornfeld, Joel Rosenman, and John P. Roberts put on what has come to be arguably the best-known music festival of all time: the Woodstock Music and Art Fair. Advertised as three days of peace and music, the event attracted some 400,000 attendees (twice the expected 200,000 maximum) who were entertained by 32 acts. While Woodstock certainly wasn't the [first music festival](https://loudwire.com/what-was-first-music-festival/) to be held in the U.S., it changed the course of the industry from community-run and just-for-fun to commercial and competitive. READ MORE: [What Was The First Music Festival?](https://loudwire.com/what-was-first-music-festival/) From Bethel to Major Cities Across the States About 32 million Americans attend music festivals each year, according to [Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/culture/events/music-festival-statistics-graphic-6539009/). Almost half of these are millennials, who place a lot of value on experiences and travel. Organizers, recognizing the generation's priorities and massive spending power, have started making their events not just parties but destinations. Rather than running festivals in rural areas like Bethel, New York, many of the country's biggest events are now held within a few hours of the biggest cities. Roadtrip for the Best Music In light of that, [Vivid Seats](https://www.vividseats.com/) compiled data on which metros are the closest to the most music events. More than 500 U.S. music festivals in 2023 were considered that have the highest ticket sales on Vivid Seats or are among the events that have the highest past attendance. Metros are ranked by the most music festivals within a one-hour drive. Any ties were broken by festivals within a four-hour drive. Drive times were acquired from the location platform [Here](https://www.here.com/). Read on to see where your home base should be if you plan to hit up a festival or two this year.

    "text": "Врач рассказал об опасности купания в открытых водоёмах\nКупание в природных водоёмах может быть не только приятным, но и опасным для здоровья, предупредил врач-терапевт и пульмонолог Марат Фаррахов.\nСпециалист объяснил, что при попадании загрязнённой воды в рот можно заразиться кишечными инфекциями, включая дизентерию, сальмонеллез, кишечную палочку, ротавирус и гепатит А. Через микротравмы на коже — лептоспироз, а в тёплой воде — фолликулит и паразитарные инфекции, пишут «Известия».\nОдним из наиболее частых летних недугов врач назвал церкариоз, или «зуд купальщика». Его вызывают личинки паразитов — церкарии, которые обитают в воде с улитками и водоплавающими птицами. Попадая на кожу человека, они вызывают аллергическую реакцию: зуд, сыпь, отек, а иногда и повышение температуры.\nНаибольший риск заражения — в тёплых стоячих водоемах, особенно в жаркую погоду. Чтобы избежать проблем, врач рекомендует купаться только в официально разрешённых местах, не глотать воду, не нырять без очков, а после купания — обязательно принимать душ. При наличии ссадин и повреждений кожи лучше отказаться от водных процедур.\nРанее в Роспотребнадзоре объяснили, чем опасно купание в фонтанах.",

    "title": "Bethlehem ‘without Christmas trees, without lights’ due to Israel-Hamas war",
    "text": "Bethlehem, the normally bustling biblical birthplace of Jesus, resembles a ghost town this Christmas Eve, with celebrations called off due to the Israel-Hamas war. The festive lights and Christmas tree that normally decorate Manger Square are missing, as are the foreign tourists who gather each year to mark the holiday. Dozens of Palestinian security forces patrol the empty square. Gift shops have been slow to open on Christmas Eve, although a few did open their doors once the rain stopped pouring down. There are few visitors, however. He said he always comes to Bethlehem to mark Christmas, but this year was especially sobering, as he gazed at a nativity scene in Manger Square with a baby Jesus wrapped in a white shroud, symbolising the hundreds of children killed in the fighting in Gaza. Barbed wire surrounds the scene, with grey rubble added to the spectacle reflecting none of the lights and bursts of colour that normally fill the square during the Christmas season. Ala’a Salameh, one of the owners of Afteem Restaurant, a family-owned falafel restaurant just steps from the square, said: “We can’t justify putting out a tree and celebrating as normal, when some people (in Gaza) don’t even have houses to go to.” He said his restaurant was operating at about 15% of normal business and was not able to cover operating costs. Mr Salameh estimated that even after the war ends, it will take another year for tourism to return to Bethlehem as normal. The cancellation of Christmas festivities is a severe blow to the town’s economy. Tourism accounts for an estimated 70% of Bethlehem’s income – almost all of that during the Christmas season. With many major airlines cancelling flights to Israel, few foreigners are visiting. Local officials say around 70 hotels in Bethlehem have been forced to close, leaving thousands of people unemployed. The war was triggered by Hamas’ deadly assault October 7 on southern Israel in which militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 240 hostages. The fighting in Gaza has also affected life in the West Bank. Since October 7, access to Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the Israeli-occupied territory has been difficult, with long lines of motorists waiting to pass military checkpoints. The restrictions have also prevented tens of thousands of Palestinians from exiting the territory to work in Israel.",
