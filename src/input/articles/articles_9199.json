    "text": "Il 2023 al cinema si chiude con tante risate: per quest’ultimo weekend dell’anno sono infatti in arrivo un paio di divertenti commedie nostrane. In primis torna sul grande schermo «Vacanze di Natale» in versione restaurata, che rimarrà in sala solo un giorno, sabato 30 dicembre , per celebrare i quarant’anni di questa famosissima pellicola diretta da Carlo Vanzina . Nel cast tantissimi storici interpreti della commedia italiana: Jerry Calà, Christian De Sica, Claudio Amendola, Stefania Sandrelli, Karina Huff, Guido Nicheli, Riccardo Garrone, Mario Brega, Marilù Tolo, Antonellina Interlenghi e altri. Un’ottima occasione, insomma, per rivedere questo cult natalizio e passare una serata divertente con tutta la famiglia.\nScopri qui la programmazione completa dei cinema bergamaschi .\nEsce invece giovedì 28 dicembre «Come può uno scoglio» , che vede Pio e Amedeo nei panni, rispettivamente, di un agiato ereditiere e di un ex carcerato che vivono un incontro-scontro piuttosto rocambolesco.\nIl 2024 inizierà con la stessa atmosfera allegra, grazie alla commedia di e con Alessandro Siani «Succede anche nelle migliori famiglie» , che riprende la classica trama di un matrimonio che «non s’ha da fare». L’unione da impedire in questo caso è quella tra la benestante neo vedova Lina e il suo vecchio amore di gioventù Angelo; a mettere i bastoni tra le ruote alla nuova coppia arrivano i figli di lei, interpretati da Siani, Cristiana Capotondi e Dino Abbrescia .\nAl cinema c’è anche la commedia drammatica «Foglie al vento» del regista finlandese Aki Kaurismäki . Il film è stato acclamato dalla critica per la capacità realistica e toccante di rappresentare i drammi delle classi sociali meno agiate. Insignito del «Premio della giuria» a Cannes, è candidato a due Golden Globe.\nPer i più piccoli sono ancora in sala il cartoon «Prendi il volo» , il colorato «Wonka» con Timothée Chalamet e «Wish» , il film che celebra il centenario di Disney.\nIl nuovo anno porta con sé una novità imperdibile per tutti gli appassionati di anime giapponesi: il maestro Miyazaki torna in sala con «Il ragazzo e l’airone» , che racconta di Mahito, un ragazzo di 12 anni che si avventura in un regno abitato dai vivi e dai morti. Scritto e diretto da Hayao Miyazaki, è stato prodotto dallo Studio Ghibli: si tratta di uno dei film d’animazione più costosi mai realizzati in Giappone. Candidato ai Golden Globe 2024 sia come miglior film d’animazione sia come miglior colonna sonora, è stato definito dalla critica un vero e proprio capolavoro. Sarà disponibile nelle sale italiane a partire del 1° gennaio, solo per pochi giorni.\nScopri qui la programmazione completa dei cinema bergamaschi.\nFoglie al vento Holappa e Ansa sono un uomo e una donna che si incontrano una notte a Helsinki. I due hanno vite segnate dal disagio e dalla precarietà. Sono passati da un contratto di lavoro all’altro senza la minima garanzia sociale, e i problemi economici sono per loro una preoccupazione quotidiana. Per svagarsi trascorrono le loro serate nei bar a ubriacarsi e cantare al karaoke, ed è proprio in una di queste occasioni che si incontrano. Organizzano di vedersi per andare al cinema e da quel momento inizia una travagliata storia d’amore, fra alcolismo e famiglie disfunzionali... Scritto, diretto e prodotto dal regista finlandese Aki Kaurismäki, è l’ultimo capitolo della sua quadrilogia dedicata al proletariato, composta da «Ombre nel paradiso» (1986), «Ariel» (1988) e «La fiammiferaia» (1990).\nCome può uno scoglio Pio è un giovane uomo impacciato e dal carattere tranquillo. Avvocato di professione, ha avuto una vita agiata. È sposato con Borromea dalla quale ha avuto due figli e vive nel castello dei marchesi Pasin, i suoi consuoceri, tenutari di una storica cantina vinicola che produce prosecco. Alla morte del padre, un ricco costruttore che nel corso della sua vita ha sempre scelto per il figlio e che di fatto lo sta facendo anche da defunto, Pio eredita la presidenza dell’azienda paterna, ma non è finita qui. Un gruppo di imprenditori del suo paese lo ha candidato come sindaco, con l’idea di poterlo manipolare e sfruttare a loro vantaggio la mancanza di polso di Pio. Sebbene sembri rimanere inerme mentre questi eventi si susseguono nella sua vita, Pio d’un tratto fa esattamente quello che ci si aspetta da un vulcano dormiente: esplode. Ad accendere la scintilla è il parroco della cittadina don Boschin, nonché guida spirituale del padre di Pio, che chiede al ragazzo il favore di aiutare l’ex galeotto Amedeo, assumendolo come suo autista... Continua la collaborazione tra il regista e sceneggiatore Gennaro Nunziante e il duo di comici foggiani, formato da Pio D’Antini e Amedeo Grieco. Dopo aver lavorato a «Belli ciao» (2022), il trio torna sul grande schermo con un’altra pellicola scritta insieme.\n© RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA",

    "title": "If we can't trust our church leaders to protect us",
    "text": "If we can’t trust our church leaders to protect us\nIn recent years, teachings on unity, loyalty, and honor have permeated the Church far and wide. These messages have been reinforced with Scripture and stories of biblical characters that have touched our hearts and moved us emotionally time and time again.\nBut my question has been in recent days, what about all the Scripture verses where God came down and caused “disunity” and “divine disruption?” What about the stories from church history where God saved believers from apostasy, heresy, and abuse by separating them from corrupt religious institutions so they could pursue religious freedom elsewhere, in harmony with Scripture and the Spirit of God? Could it be that we’ve had wolves living among us occupying our highest seats of authority in the ecclesiastical order while using the shield of false unity, false covering, and false love to evade accountability and remain covert in their efforts to devour the sheep and profane the house of God? I believe it could be. Even more, I believe it mostly likely has been!\nJohn10:11-13 (NKJV):\n“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep. But a hireling, he who is not the shepherd, one who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf catches the sheep and scatters them. The hireling flees because he is a hireling and does not care about the sheep.”\nIn his first coming, Jesus went to the cross and died as our substitute for sin. But He also walked the earth as a man in human form to be our example. He is our model friend and brother. He is our model Christian and saint. He is also our model leader and shepherd. What is good for the master is good for the disciple (Matt.10:25).\nAs the good shepherd, Jesus not only brought comfort through His encouraging messages, He also fought off the wolves when they came around. He exposed their evil deeds and clearly identified their traits so that we would know them by their fruits (Matt.7:15-23). In His apostolic succession, He raised up leaders that did the same.\nPeter discerned wolves, deceivers, and enemies of righteousness on a number of occasions and boldly confronted them for the safety of the body. In Acts 5:1-11 Peter confronted Ananais and Sapphira for lying to the Holy Ghost and pronounced God-ordained judgment on them which led to their immediate death. Many who endlessly tout the message of God’s love today tend to ignore this story or blame it on Peter’s underdeveloped Pauline grace. I think it’s a clear example of the dealings of a holy God who does not change (Mal.3:6). In Acts 8:20-23 Peter confronted Simon the Sorcerer and told him his heart was not right, he was bound by bitterness and iniquity, and that he would perish with his money if he did not repent.\nPaul the Apostle also followed Jesus’ example as a good shepherd and fearlessly defended the house of God while expelling wolves and evil doers. In Acts 13 Paul publicly called out Elymas the Sorcerer and said, “O full of all deceit and all fraud, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease perverting the straight ways of the Lord?” After Elymas was confronted He was blinded by the Lord for several days and had to be led around by the hand (Acts 13:11).\nSo once again, my question is: if the standard for how leaders dealt with unrepentant sin and for how they dealt with wolves that threatened the flock was so plainly laid out in our New Testament role models of leadership, then why is it so hard to find courageous leaders today that will call a spade a spade, and do what a good shepherd must do to protect the flock of God? I believe the answer lies in our teachings and culture that has flourished in error and has left wide open doors for wolves to rise to power and operate in contempt of God’s justice and righteous standard in the church.\nWe must always remember the temptation that our Lord overcame when Satan enticed him in a physically diminished state as He was fasting and praying in the wilderness for 40 days. One attack of Satan targeted his identity, questioning His sonship. Another attack sought to arouse human ego and the need to be elevated to power and prestige before one’s time. But if you recall, the most powerful attack was when Satan quoted Scripture to Jesus and contextually used the verses for his own Satanic doctrine. Satan boldly said, “If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down. For it is written: ‘He shall give His angels charge over you,’ and ‘In their hands they shall bear you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone” (Matt.4:6). Satan was quoting Ps.91:12. For the world Satan is one thing, but for the believer He comes as the great theologian eager to supply us with an ample amount of biblical support for the lies we so desperately want to live by and believe.\nLeaders in our time must identify where we have perverted core teachings such as the love of God, the culture of honor, unity, and kingdom covenant relationship. We must weed out the doctrines of demons that have led to the church being a predator’s paradise and a wolf summit. We must dust off the chapters of the Bible we haven’t considered for years because we thought those verses were only for “religiously minded leaders.” We must restore safety to the body at all costs. This will mean acknowledging where our doctrinal errors have led to wolves being restored back into ministry time and time again, only to keep preying on the sheep and extorting the people of God.\nIt will mean taking on the Spirit of Jesus the Great Shepherd and refusing the way of the hireling any longer. A good shepherd gives his life for the sheep. A good shepherd doesn’t flee or become derelict in his duty because the culture of honor demands that our love covers up the multitude of sins and abuses being committed by the wolf. A good shepherd takes ownership of the sheep and protects them no matter what, even if it comes at great personal cost to him and his ministry. God is looking for good shepherds in our day who can bring justice to victims, restore safety in the Body, and begin to rebuild trust where it has been so badly broken. If we can’t trust our leaders to protect us, then we can’t trust them to teach us the word of God or watch over our souls.\nStephen Powell is the founder of Lion of Light Ministries & the Kingdom School of Ministry, where He has dedicated his life to preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ with power, as well as training and equipping the body through strong biblical teaching & mentorship. He holds a Bachelor’s Degree in Ministry, with an understudy in Biblical Studies and Theology from Primus University of Theology. Stephen’s vision is to help the body of Christ experience the presence and power of God in a real way, be strengthened in their faith through the ministry of God’s Word, and help the bride of Christ walk in holiness and intimacy with the Lord!

    "title": "Ed Dwight, Black astronaut who fought to be in 'The Space Race'",
    "text": "Ed Dwight is featured in NatGeo's \"The Space Race,\" a NatGeo film now streaming on Hulu and Disney+. This story first appeared in a USA TODAY special section, on newsstands now. Ed Dwight should have been the first. The test pilot was in training in the 1960s, on track to become NASA’s first Black astronaut, when systemic racism shut him out. Dwight seemed like the prototype for an astronaut. From the time he was 2, airplanes had captivated him. The Dwights lived on the edge of Kansas City, Kansas, within walking distance of a small airport that hunters used to fly to Colorado and Wyoming. “Every day I’d go around, and I was just hanging out,” he says from his home in Denver. “I was a little bitty kid, and I became their mascot, the Black kid running around. They were obviously worried about me running into a propeller or something. I kept hanging around so long that they put me to work.” “Mostly, I was cleaning out the beer bottles in the bottom of the airplane,” he says. “So, I thought it was a requirement: to actually fly, you had to drink beer.” Dwight laughs and adds that they paid him with pocket change. All the little boy cared about was being around the planes. That fascination only grew over the years. When he was 8 years old, the U.S. entered World War II, and Dwight started reading books about airplanes. “They were trying to recruit pilots everywhere,” Dwight says. “They had these air force training manuals, the same manuals they used for training Army Air Corps pilots, that they put in the libraries across the country, so the kids would have access to them. I checked them out when I was 8 and I kept them on checkout till I was 18. I read them every day, and that’s how I got all the background I needed for flying.” Fourteen years before he nearly integrated the astronaut corps, Dwight and his sister integrated a local Catholic high school. That, too, was not without battles. “My mom looked like she was white,” Dwight says. But when school administrators realized the siblings were Black, they withdrew their acceptance. His mom appealed to the church and went up levels until she wrote to the pope. “The Vatican ordered Bishop Ward High School to integrate,” Dwight says. “We were the two little Black kids that walked into Bishop Ward High School, and the enrollment dropped by 300 when we walked in the door.” Dwight earned an engineering degree and enlisted in the Air Force after graduation. While training to become a test pilot, he earned a degree in aeronautical engineering. During his Air Force service, he reached the rank of captain. When the government came looking for a Black man who had the right stuff, Dwight was a natural. While campaigning, John F. Kennedy knew he needed the Black vote to win the presidency. Meeting with Black leaders, he was told to find a Black astronaut. Yet, Dwight says, Kennedy “was between a rock and a hard place.” “He was scared to death of Dr. King and the movement, because he thought that if he got ever hooked up with Dr. King and his people that he would never bepresident,” Dwight says. “He could not let the white American public know he was going to let Black people do all these wonderful things.” Yet Dwight was already doing wonderful things. It seemed as if those years of reading air force manuals, earning degrees, and training as a test pilot were about to pay off. Yet Chuck Yeager and other white men in power thwarted Dwight’s trajectory toward becoming the first Black NASA astronaut. When JFK was killed, so were Dwight’s chances. A press conference shown in “The Space Race” has reporters expecting to meet a Black astronaut. Instead, it was more of the same — white guys. No reason was given. Dwight was issued different orders. “President Johnson decided he wanted his own Black astronaut,” he says. Dwight resigned from the Air Force in 1966 and went from success to success. He worked for IBM and had a barbecue restaurant. He turned to his other abiding interest, art. At 90, he continues to create. His sculptures honor Black lives, include those of MLK, Hank Aaron and Frederick Douglass, and grace public spaces around the country. He continues to have a keen interest in the space program, particularly Black astronauts. And Dwight harbors no rancor. “I basically served my purpose,” Dwight says. “I opened the conversation that had to be opened. Somebody had to do it. I got the lucky card being the guy that had the constitution to take all that crap that I took.” While Dwight isn’t in the history books for breaking NASA’s racial barrier, those who came after him honor the trail he blazed. He considers how he wants to be remembered. “I tried to make this place a better place,” Dwight says. “I’m restricted to these black-white issues about Black history,” he says. “And because the path I’ve chosen is to put on the map that Black people really did do something, and that they were here and they’re not lesser human beings. They can be educated. They’re smart. They can do things that white people can do, and they can do it with panache, and they can do something besides play basketball and be a wide receiver in the NFL or sing their tails off making music.” He draws on lessons his father imparted. “The white man likes to be entertained, and so he’ll allow the Black people to be rich, the Black athletes to be rich, the Black musicians to be rich — and he’ll allow for that, but that’s a special case,” Dwight says. Racism was so entrenched that even Dwight did not know about the Black women, featured decades later in the book and film “Hidden Figures,” who were performing the advanced mathematical calculations for NASA that should have been propelling him into space. Yet Dwight is encouraged by those who have come since, including astronaut Victor Glover, who will pilot the Artemis 2 mission to orbit the moon, tentatively scheduled for 2025. “When I talked to Victor, I get really encouraged,” Dwight says. “He thinks like I do — that we’re trying to make this place a better place.”",

    "text": "WASHINGTON — The defense lawyers representing a [woman accused of a carjacking crash](/article/news/crime/accused-carjacker-facing-murder-charges-crashing-car-victim-inside/65-ba3fb636-5b60-4fb8-84eb-b60f6a4141ad) earlier this month have requested that their client be released from D.C. jail over allegations of \"atrocious and inhumane treatment.\" Kayla Brown, from Southeast D.C., appeared in D.C. Superior Court Thursday afternoon for a mental health hearing. During the proceedings it was revealed that Brown has received a diagnosis and is on medication. However, Judge Heidi M. Pasichow decided that the details of the mental health evaluation will be sealed to the public. Initial court documents indicate that Brown's parents told investigators that their daughter had received drugs from a man she had met on Instagram and that she had been acting erratic for three days prior to the alleged carjacking. During the hearing, the judge said that the medical expert who conducted Brown's mental health evaluation recommended that the 22-year-old remain in custody of the D.C. Department of Corrections (DOC). Brown's defense requested that their client be released from the D.C. jail to a locked facility at St. Elizabeth's Hospital. Her lawyers claim she has been assaulted by DOC staff and deprived of showering and water. They also allege that she has been unjustifiably placed in a secure cell. DOC has not responded to WUSA9's requests for comment about the allegations made by Brown's lawyer. Following a heated exchange between the defense and Judge Pasichow, it was determined that the issue of where Brown will remain in custody will be determined during a June 17 hearing. Court documents indicate that on Jun. 3 Brown was transported to Washington Hospital Center by ambulance. Investigators say she escaped from the medical facility in a White Mazda that was at the entrance of the hospital. The passenger of the vehicle, [Leslie Marie Gaines, 55, was still inside the car.](/article/news/community/gofundme-for-woman-killed-in-carjacking-crash-outside-hospital-in-northwest-dc/65-a5bc5f78-c38b-4621-82c0-a9454edae958) Gaines' daughter had taken her mother to the hospital after experiencing blurred vision and loss of feeling in her legs according to court documents. Investigators say Gaines' daughter left her mother inside the running car while she got a wheelchair. Less than 20 minutes after the alleged carjacking, police say Brown crashed the car into the building that houses the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia's offices in Northwest D.C. Brown was arrested as she fled from the crash scene and Gaines was pronounced dead. Gaines' cause of death has yet to be disclosed pending the medical examiner's report. Police arrested and charged Brown with felony murder, kidnapping, and carjacking, but the U.S. Attorney's Office only filed an unarmed carjacking charge. Any additional charges will be determined by the ongoing investigation according to prosecutors.",

    "text": "Tra le questioni annose per il Vaticano che il pontificato di Bergoglio si è impegnato ad affrontare ci sono i preti sposati: tutto disatteso dal Papa\nPapa Francesco dice no all'accesso delle donne al diaconato. E in merito al celibato dei preti spiega che “un Papa potrebbe disporre che diventi opzionale”, ma non sarà lui a farlo.\nLo ha chiarito il Pontefice nel libro intervista uscito nell'ottobre 2023 nelle librerie per le edizioni Salani “Non sei solo. Sfide, risposte, speranze”, realizzato nei mesi scorsi in Argentina dai giornalisti Francesca Ambrogetti, ex responsabile dell'Ansa nel Paese sudamericano, e Sergio Rubin del quotidiano El Clarin.\nCelibato non obbligatorio? \"Lo disponga il mio successore\"\nIl celibato opzionale e quindi non più obbligatorio per i preti?\n“Che lo disponga, se lo riterrà opportuno, il mio successore. Certo, è chiaro che se uno lo vive male, il celibato è una tortura, diventa impossibile. Ma non è meno vero che se uno lo vive con la fecondità del ministero che ha scelto, non solo è sopportabile, ma anche bellissimo. È ovvio che ci vuole la vocazione”, ha chiarito Papa Francesco.\nIn ogni caso c’era nella Chiesa chi temeva che l’accesso di uomini sposati al sacerdozio aprisse le porte al celibato opzionale. Non è ancora giunto il momento di prenderlo in considerazione?\n“Ognuno è libero di pensare quello che vuole, ma mi sembra siano due cose diverse. Il celibato, come ho già detto, è una questione disciplinare, il che implica che un Papa potrebbe disporre che diventi opzionale. Come lo è, infatti, nelle chiese di rito orientale. Ma anche gli orientali, pur essendo più religiosi, hanno problemi di divorzio. Inoltre, i sacerdoti anglicani sposati con figli che passano al cattolicesimo rimangono sacerdoti. Tuttavia, su questo punto, rispetto la tradizione della Chiesa d’Occidente. E come ho già segnalato, è un requisito che non ha a che vedere con gli abusi sessuali”.\nPer il Movimento Internazionale dei sacerdoti sposati il celibato obbligatorio è una questione diversa dalla riammissione al ministero dei preti sposati, tabù per Bergoglio.\nFonte: Sky Tg24",
