    "text": "Israel exonerates troops who killed Israeli captives in Gaza Israeli military investigation finds the killings of three Israeli captives could have been prevented. But, no disciplinary action will be taken as there was \"no malice\" involved. Israeli soldiers ignored cries for \"help\" when they stormed a Gaza building holding three captives just days before killing them by \"mistake,\" said a military investigation, while absolving the soldiers from any blame. The soldiers also heard \"hostages\" shouted in Hebrew on December 10, but interpreted that as a \"terrorist deception attempt\" by Hamas fighters to lure them into the building in the Gaza City district of Shejaiya, said the probe published on Thursday. Believing the building was rigged with explosives, the soldiers exited and killed five Hamas fighters trying to escape, it alleged. The hostages then probably fled the building also, and on December 15 Israeli soldiers shot them after identifying them as a \"threat,\" the investigation said. Two were killed instantly. The third hostage fled and soldiers were ordered to hold fire in order to identify him, the probe said. Hearing cries of \"help!\" and \"they're shooting at me\", Israeli commanders asked the surviving hostage to advance towards the soldiers. But two soldiers \"who did not hear the order\" because of \"noise\" from a nearby tank shot him dead. The three hostages were all shirtless and one had been carrying a white flag. The Israel military concluded \"that there was no malice in the event, and the soldiers carried out the right action to the best of their understanding of the event at that moment.\" On December 14, an army drone had identified signs of \"SOS\" and \"help, three hostages\" on a building close to where the three hostages were shot. The army \"failed in its mission to rescue the hostages in this event,\" army chief Herzi Halevi said in a statement published along with the report of the investigation. The three fatalities \"could have been prevented\", he added. Netanyahu in hot water Israel has been mourning the killings of the hostages identified as Yotam Haim, Alon Shamriz and Samer El-Talalqa. The killings of the three men, all in their twenties, have sparked protests in Tel Aviv, where demonstrators demand that the authorities come up with a new plan to bring home the remaining 129 captives still held in besieged Gaza. Relatives and families of the captives blame Netanyahu and his far-right government for the crisis and for not doing enough to return the captives. Pressure has been mounting on Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption, and his government to strike a deal to return the captives. Israel's war on besieged Gaza has killed over 21,000 Palestinians; 8,800 are children, and 6,300 are women. About 55,603 others have been wounded while thousands are feared buried under debris of bombarded homes.",

    "text": "Flooding, thunderstorm risk, Auckland, Northland, Coromandel under heavy rain watch Flooding, thunderstorm risk, Auckland, Northland, Coromandel under heavy rain watch Almost a full day of rain is likely for parts of New Zealand today and tonight, with the upper North Island and the west of the South Island in for heavy rain through to tomorrow. Hikers, campers and New Year’s Eve revellers are being warned to take care as thunderstorms, slips and flooding - including flooded rivers - are possible in the worst-hit areas. A warm, moist northwesterly flow is bringing rain or showers to all parts of the country, with thunderstorms possible in northern and western parts of both islands and the Deep South. Flood risk north of Auckland This afternoon MetService added heavy rain watches for Northland, Coromandel and Auckland, where rain has already been bucketing down since lunchtime. Those regions are now set for periods of heavy rain with possible thunderstorms. Rain levels could approach or even exceed warning criteria in localised areas, the forecaster warned. Downpours of 25-40mm per hour were possible. Thunderstorms and “very heavy, slow moving rain” meant there was a risk of pockets of flooding around the Northland-Auckland boundary this afternoon, according to forecaster Weatherwatch.co.nz. MetService last night put weather watches and warnings in place from Waikato and Bay of Plenty down to Fiordland, with 100-160mm of rain possible in some warning areas. The west of the South Island is bearing the brunt of the bad weather, along with Taranaki, which has been hit by torrential rain since this morning. A heavy rain warning is in place for Taranaki Maunga through till 3am with a peak of 15-25 mm/h expected until mid-afternoon today. The Westland ranges are under a 21-hour heavy rain warning until 6am Saturday, with 100-140 mm of rain expected over that time and peak rates of 20-30mm/h. Nelson has a heavy rain warning until 7pm tonight with up to 90mm of rain in total. Heavy rain watches lasting 22 hours are in place for Buller, Waikato, Waitomo, Taumarunui, Taupō, Tongariro National Park and the Kaimanawa Mountains, while Fiordland’s watch lasts for 20 hours. In the Bay of Plenty including Rotorua a heavy rain watch is in place till 10am Saturday. Rainfall amounts could reach warning criteria in all those areas, with thunderstorms also possible in many areas. Heavy rain means streams and rivers can rise rapidly and driving conditions may be hazardous, with possible surface flooding and slips. Thunderstorms are also possible in many areas, bringing intense localised downpours, according to MetService. The national forecaster’s meteorologist John Law said those thinking of going camping should keep an eye on the forecasts to avoid being stranded by sudden floods or slips. With heavy rain also expected across the Tararua Ranges and the Tongariro Crossing, keen hikers should also take care, Law said. New Year’s Day to bring drier weather for 2024 The fast-moving weather system should improve by mid-Saturday but another front will bring more rain on Sunday, MetService says. But there’s good news as 2024 dawns - both MetService and private forecaster WeatherWatch expect the weather to clear for New Year’s Day. WeatherWatch head forecaster Philip Duncan said a big block of high pressure coming in from the Tasman Sea and Southern Ocean will bring clearing, cooler weather on January 1, with the recent high humidity taking a break.

    "title": "Kimray layoffs announced this week could cut over 100 positions in OKC",
    "text": "Oil and gas solutions provider Kimray might cut over 100 positions, most in OKC Rebecca Heliot The Oklahoman Kimray Inc. began layoffs this week, eliminating around 120 positions and reducing its workforce by around 15% after the company underperformed in annual earnings.\nEmployees will be impacted during layoffs through Friday as the company undergoes corporate restructuring, Kimray Inc. announced in a news release Thursday. Staff cuts impacted employees from all departments, including administration, sales, production and support. Leadership attributed market changes and underperforming annual earnings as key factors contributing to workforce reduction.\n“While there has been a softening in the oil and gas market, there is still a healthy demand for our product,\" said CEO Thomas Hill lll. \"After evaluating our long-term goals, we decided to focus more on Kimray’s core business. This means reducing our staff and reorganizing our teams.”\nLayoffs primarily impact Kimray employees in Oklahoma City A majority of the layoffs impact local employees, though employees in other locations may be affected, too, said an employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the issue.\n\"[It] appears to be around 15-16% reduction in workforce, primarily in Oklahoma City but also across the various Kimray stores in Oklahoma, Texas and Pennsylvania,\" the employee said.\"Kimray has pretty aggressive EBITDA targets pf 43%+. This year has been in the mid- to upper 30s.\"\nAlthough Kimray stores remain operating during normal business hours, the energy firm's corporate headquarters at 52 NW 42 has been closed down until it reopens Sept. 15 as a direct result of layoffs.\nMore: Impact of Dell layoffs on Oklahoma City operations still uncertain\nKimray announced the layoffs in a news release Thursday afternoon, after employees received an email that morning from Hill regarding layoffs. The email to employees stated:\n\"Kimray's leadership team has been evaluating the company's long-term goals, organizational structure, revenue, costs, and staffing levels to determining what size Kimray should be moving forward. Unfortunately, Kimray's workforce has grown too large for our current and expected customer needs. Our increase in overhead and fixed costs is a primary reason why we have a significant drop in EBITDA margin this year, despite near record-level sales.\"\nAlthough some sale positions were cut Wednesday before the announcement, most layoffs will take place Sept. 12 and Sept. 13, Hill stated in the email.\nKimray also had layoffs in 2016 Cody Cox, vice president of field operations at the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission, said he had not received any WARN notices from the energy firm regarding layoffs this week. Kimray layoffs do not warrant a mandatory WARN notice, however. Notices are only mandatory when staff cuts equal or exceed 33% of a company's total workforce, though companies are free to report workforce reductions at any size.\n\"We are committed to helping our people through this transition with at least three months of wages and benefits,” said Kimray President Bob Cole in the release. “We will also provide job placement and counseling services to help them find new employment.”\nA unpredictable oil and gas market and the pandemic led to Kimray layoffs in 2016, affecting the same amount of workers facing job losses now. However, since then the company seemed to be recovering, acquiring Texas-based company Control Equipment Inc. (CEI) in 2021. That same year, the Oklahoma Department of Commerce showed the company added around 100 new jobs to its Oklahoma locations to meet growing product demand.\nKimray launched a new product last August called the Electric Actuator, designed to reduce emissions and automate control in oil and gas productions, a news release stated. It also released Gen 3 Liquid Level Controller, a solution for liquid dump applications, in 2023. Products sell online and at 10 stores across the nation with the majority located in Texas.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",

    "text": "Exciting Discussions Ahead: Mesoblast's Path with FDA for Revascor\nAddison PerryUpdated: 04-02-2025 07:30 PM\nMesoblast's Request for Type B Meeting with FDA\nMesoblast, known for its pioneering advancements in cellular therapies, has proactively filed a request to engage with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This meeting aims to explore the accelerated approval pathway for Revascor (rexlemestrocel-L) aimed at treating ischemic chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and inflammation.\nWhat to Expect in the Upcoming Meeting\nThe meeting is anticipated to take place soon, following a previous Type B meeting last year where the FDA acknowledged Mesoblast's eligibility to seek accelerated approval for Revascor in patients with severe heart failure conditions. This original guidance emphasized that upon approval, a single confirmatory trial targeting class II/III patients will still be mandatory.\nMain Objectives of the Meeting\nOne of the key directives of this meeting is obtaining vital feedback from the FDA concerning several important factors. These include relevant chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC), and ensuring alignment on potency assays necessary for the product's commercial release. Furthermore, Mesoblast aims to discuss their proposed design and primary endpoint for the essential confirmatory trial that follows any accelerated approval.\nAbout Mesoblast: A Leader in Cellular Medicines\nMesoblast is a globally recognized leader in developing allogeneic cellular medicines that focus on treating severe and life-threatening inflammatory diseases. Their patented mesenchymal lineage cell therapy technology works by addressing severe inflammation through innovative and responsive mechanisms, thereby modulating various components of the immune response, which leads to a significant attenuation of the harmful inflammatory processes.\nCurrent Therapeutic Innovations\nOne of Mesoblast's notable products, RYONCIL (remestemcel-L), has been recognized as the first FDA approved mesenchymal stromal cell therapy for treating steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease in pediatric patients aged two months and older. This groundbreaking treatment is a testament to Mesoblast's commitment to cellular therapy innovation.\nFostering Further Developments in Inflammation Therapies\nMesoblast's portfolio continues to expand as they focus on developing additional therapies targeting various inflammatory conditions. These include enhancing the applications of RYONCIL across different demographics and furthering research into rexlemestrocel-L for heart failure and chronic low back pain. Mesoblast has formed strategic partnerships across key global markets, including Japan, Europe, and China, facilitating the accessibility of these innovative therapies.\nIntellectual Property and Manufacturing Strides\nThe company boasts an extensive global intellectual property portfolio with over 1,000 patents and applications that secure their proprietary therapies across multiple indications. This robust foundation is expected to offer commercial protection until at least 2041 in further significant markets.\nIn conjunction with their intellectual property strengths, Mesoblast's innovative manufacturing processes are engineered to produce cryopreserved, off-the-shelf cellular medicines at an industrial scale. These advanced cell therapies are designed with clear pharmaceutical release criteria, making them readily available for patients around the world.\nConclusion: Looking Towards the Future\nMesoblast’s growing presence in the field of cellular medicine is accented by their focus on innovative treatments and the upcoming discussions with the FDA regarding the future of Revascor. With their significant regulatory engagements, ongoing research, and dedicated approach to addressing patient needs, Mesoblast sets the stage for impactful contributions to healthcare.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is the purpose of Mesoblast’s Type B meeting with the FDA?\nThe meeting aims to discuss the accelerated approval pathway for Revascor for treating ischemic chronic heart failure.\nWhat feedback is Mesoblast seeking from the FDA?\nMesoblast is looking to receive guidance on manufacturing protocols and confirmatory trial designs necessary for the product's approval pathway.\nWhat are Mesoblast’s main therapeutic focuses?\nThe company is dedicated to developing cellular therapies for severe inflammatory diseases, including heart failure and chronic back pain.\nHow does Mesoblast ensure the availability of its therapies?\nMesoblast employs proprietary manufacturing processes that yield cryopreserved, off-the-shelf cellular medicines, facilitating global distribution.\nWhat is the significance of Mesoblast's intellectual property portfolio?\nTheir extensive patent portfolio provides substantial commercial protection for their groundbreaking therapies, helping secure their innovations in multiple markets.\nAbout The Author\nContact Addison Perry privately here.

    "text": "( MENAFN - EIN Presswire)\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog surrounded by the heads of the Churches of the Holy Land on Dec. 21. (Credit: X/@Isaac_Herzog)\nThe military court is an instrument used by Hezbollah to silence any criticism of Hezbollah or Iran in Lebanon.” - Tom Harb, MECHRIC DirectorWASHINGTON, DC, UNITED STATES, December 29, 2023 /EINPresswire / -- The Middle East Christian Committee condemns those in the government of Lebanon who would take legal action against Christian religious leaders for meeting Israel's President Herzog in the Holy Land on the occasion of the New Year on December 21. The traditional meeting drew the expected criticism from leaders of Hezbollah: \"The image provoked me because there cannot be a religious figure worshiping God, believing in justice and right, aligning themselves with Israel, tyranny, and colonialism,\" stated Sadek Naboulsi, a religious sheikh close to Hezbollah, who accused anyone meeting an Israeli of \"treason.\"\nThe minister of information Ziad Makari stated:“I was bothered by the image of the two bishops with the Israeli president, and I definitely do not agree to it, and I contacted the military court judges which has the texts related to contact with the Israeli enemy.”\nAl Ahed, a news site with ties to Hezbollah, reported that a collective of Representatives of Released Prisoners and Detainees submitted a request to the Lebanese judiciary to open an investigation against Archbishops al-Hage and Semaan, accusing them of“having contact with the Zionist [Israeli] enemy,” an offence which can carry a sentence of death.\nRadical Islamists seek to separate Christians from their Jewish brethren who follow the original religion of Jesus and even go so far as to claim Jesus was not Jewish at all. In this way, they seek to isolate Israel from the rest of the world.\nRepresentatives of Hamas, who on October 7, carried out the bloody massacre and kidnapping of Israeli civilians - the worst atrocity committed against Jews since the Holocaust - claim to have been“shocked by the photo of Christian dignitaries from the occupied Palestinian territories meeting the president of the Zionist entity on the occasion of Christmas.”\nThe relentless Muslim persecution of Christians and Jews in the Holy Land continues. Bethlehem, located in Palestinian-controlled territory, has seen a precipitous decline in its Christian population, which was once the majority in the birthplace of Jesus, but now comprises only 12% of the population. Jews, who were once found in substantial numbers across the Middle East were driven out of all the Arab states after the creation of Israel in 1948, and Christians are likewise being“ethnically cleansed” from the Muslim regions. The one exception where the Christian population is growing is in Israel.\nArchbishop Hage denied participating in the meeting himself, but also pointed out :“[T]he patriarchs and bishops who took part in this event conveyed a message related to the cause they defend, and they clearly denounced the military actions in Palestine.”\n“The US Congress should condition any future aid to the Lebanese government to this issue,” said MECHRIC Director John Hajjar.“It is inhuman to threaten to imprison the Christian clergies in Lebanon who are simply serving their dioceses in Israel and coordinating with the Israeli government on behalf of the Christians of Israel.”\n\"This is a pattern in Lebanon,” stated MECHRIC Director Tom Harb.“The military court is an instrument used by Hezbollah to silence any criticism of Hezbollah or Iran in Lebanon.”\nThe Middle East Christian Committee stands with the archbishops and the other Christian leaders seeking peace in the region and applaud their refusal to be intimidated by those pushing for war.\nRebecca Bynum\nAmerican Mideast Coalition for Democracy\n+1 615-775-6801\n...\nVisit us on social media:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nMENAFN29122023003118003196ID1107667988\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information “as is” without warranty of any kind.

    "text": "Chelsea play last this weekend in the Premier League as we host [Newcastle United](https://cominghomenewcastle.sbnation.com) for Monday Night Football at the Bridge, for a midtable clash of two teams mired in disappointing seasons. That said, we do have a three-match unbeaten run going in the league, and the only way we’ve lost in our last six was in extra-time against [Liverpool](https://liverpooloffside.sbnation.com/). So while there’s plenty of angst about our recent results, they could’ve been worse! Unfortunately, one thing that’s showing no real sign of improvement is our fitness record, with injuries piling up once again. Ben Chilwell is the latest to rejoin, picking up a knee problem that needs a specialist opinion. So that’s concerning, to say the least. Levi Colwill will also miss out after picking up a toe injury, while Conor Gallagher has been dealing with some sort of illness. He’s not been ruled out, but is certainly questionable. Reece James, Wesley Fofana, Christopher Nkunku, Roméo Lavia, and Lesley Ugochukwu remain out. Benoît Badiashile and Carney Chukwuemeka are back in light training but nowhere near ready for action. In better news, Marc Cucurella should be available having recovered from ankle surgery — though whether he’s ready to start is less clear.",
