    "title": "Jewish groups file federal complaint alleging antisemitism in Fulton schools – WABE",
    "text": "Jewish groups file federal complaint alleging antisemitism in Fulton schools Three Jewish advocacy groups filed a federal complaint against the Fulton County school district over alleged antisemitic bullying against Jewish students since the Israel-Hamas war broke out on Oct. 7. The complaint said administrators failed to take action when Jewish and Israeli students faced harassment. The school district “has fostered a hostile climate that has allowed antisemitism to thrive in its schools,” the complaint said. In a written statement, the Fulton County district denied the allegations. “The private group’s efforts to depict Fulton County Schools as promoting or even tolerating antisemitism is false,” the statement said. The organizations filed the complaint under Title IV of the Civil Rights Act with the U.S. Department of Education on Aug. 6. Title IV prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin. The complaint follows a wave of antisemitism allegations against schools and universities across the country. The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy group, filed a similar [complaint](https://apnews.com/article/philadelphia-school-district-antisemitism-complaint-2f0ad56849a91c66033853a3433bddec) in July against the Philadelphia school district, one of the country’s largest public school systems. In November, the Department of Education announced [investigations](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-colleges-civil-rights-investigation-discrimination-f93aa9355f4c2d97b188df8546cc5131) into seven schools and universities over alleged antisemitism or Islamophobia since the start of the Israel-Hamas War. Activism erupted in universities, colleges and schools when the war began. On Oct. 7, Hamas killed 1,200 people and took hostages in an attack against Israel. Over 40,000 Palestinians have been killed since the conflict began, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Some estimates say about 1.9 million people have been displaced from Gaza. The Fulton County complaint listed verbal attacks against Jewish students since Oct. 7, but it also described certain displays of pro-Palestinian sentiment as intimidating. The groups took issue with students wearing keffiyehs, a scarf that has become a symbol for the Palestinian movement. The complaint said that the day after the attacks by Hamas, students wearing keffiyehs shouted “Free Palestine” at Jewish students, a slogan the groups labeled “a rallying cry for the eradication of Israel.” Other instances detailed in the complaint involve a high school student cursing at an Israeli student in Arabic, and a middle school student telling an Israeli peer, “Somebody needs to bomb your country, and hey, somebody already did.” In the classroom, the complaint said that some of the pro-Palestinian positions teachers took were inappropriate. Jewish parents met with Fulton County school district leaders in late October after several complaints about antisemitism and “other students cosplaying as members of Hamas,” the complaint said. Parents offered to arrange antisemitic training, among other suggested actions. The complaint says school district leadership declined to take action and ignored numerous complaints, including an email to the district’s superintendent signed by over 75 parents. The district says it already takes complaints seriously. “Like most, if not all, schools across the country, world events have sometimes spilled onto our campuses,” the district said in its statement. “Whenever inappropriate behavior is brought to our attention, Fulton County Schools takes it seriously, investigates, and takes appropriate action,” the statement reads. The Louis D. Brandeis Center For Human Rights Under Law, Jewish Americans for Fairness in Education and the National Jewish Advocacy Center filed the complaint. The organizations asked the district to denounce antisemitism, discipline teachers and students for antisemitic behavior, and consider how to improve experiences for Jewish students.",

    "text": "A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her.\nThe civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and Molldrem Family Dentistry caused her significant injury that is still being corrected.\nAccording to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement.\nMolldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up.\nTreatment called 'inconceivable' Gypsy Rose Blanchard released from Missouri prison early Thursday morning, DOC confirms Cher files for conservatorship of her son, claims Elijah Blue Allman's life is 'at risk' Ex-boyfriend of missing St. Louis woman admits to her murder after Wisconsin arrest: Police 6 dead, 3 injured in Johnson County, Texas, crash; victims include 2 young kids ages 9, 10 California Pizza Huts lay off all delivery drivers ahead of minimum wage increase “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote Dr. Avrum Goldstein, a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit.\nGoldstein, who is a faculty member at NOVA Southeastern University , also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment.\n\"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.”\nDoctors remove wrong organ from man: They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.\nThe lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg.\n“Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote.\nWilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages.\nWilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "text": "[Field Level Media](/author/fieldlevelmedia/)|published: Thu Jul 25 2024 21:32 The San Francisco Giants placed infielder Wilmer Flores on the 10-day injured list on Thursday because of right knee tendonitis. The move was retroactive to Wednesday. In a corresponding move, the Giants recalled infielder David Villar from Triple-A Sacramento. \"He's a good hitter,\" Giants manager Bob Melvin said of Villar. \"He fits into this group. This will be a better opportunity for him here. He'll play the Wilmer role as far as facing lefties.\" Flores, 32, last played on Tuesday. He had missed nine games with the same injury in late June and early July. \"Never really cleared up,\" Melvin said. \"When you're not playing as much and not swinging how you're used to, you're putting in a lot of extra work, and it's not allowing it to really heal.\" Flores is batting .206 with four home runs and 26 RBIs in 71 games this season. For his 12-year career, Flores is batting .260 with 153 homers and 532 RBIs in 1,212 games for the New York Mets (2013-18), Arizona Diamondbacks (2019) and Giants. Villar, 27, is 5-for-17 (.294) with one homer and four RBIs in six games with San Francisco. In parts of three seasons since 2022, he is batting .199 with 15 home runs and 40 RBIs in 104 games. --Field Level Media",

    "text": "Così l'intelligenza artificiale plasma, già, la guerra\nIn Israele lo chiamano «Habsora»: il Vangelo.\n[Sviluppato per l'Unità 8200](https://www.cdt.ch/news/mondo/lunita-8200-e-il-suo-possibile-coinvolgimento-nelle-esplosioni-dei-cercapersone-363756), l'intelligence militare di Tel Aviv, Habsora è un software di apprendimento automatico – machine learning – che, costruito sulla base di centinaia di algoritmi predittivi, è in grado di determinare le probabili coordinate di tunnel o silos di razzi costruiti da Hamas. Un altro programma, chiamato Lavender, suggerisce alle Forze di difesa israeliane (IDF) le probabilità che un palestinese sia membro di un gruppo militante. Come funzionano? Nulla di magico. Gettati «in pasto» all'intelligenza artificiale (AI), moli di dati raccolte sull'arco di decenni – da intercettazioni di chat e telefoni a filmati satellitari – vengono rielaborate per fornire nuovi obiettivi militari. Al centro di due indagini pubblicate giorni fa da New York Times e Washington Post, l'utilizzo da parte di Israele dell'AI nella guerra a Gaza apre a una serie di quesiti a più ampio respiro. In che modo l'intelligenza artificiale è già penetrata nei conflitti contemporanei? Come verrà applicata in futuro? E come assicurare un utilizzo etico e rispettoso del diritto internazionale? Ne abbiamo parlato con Mauro Gilli, ricercatore associato al Politecnico di Zurigo ed esperto di tecnologia militare.\nComprendere l'AI\nUn passaggio importante per comprendere perché l'intelligenza artificiale sia utilizzata in guerra è, innanzitutto, capire come essa lavori. «Spesso, quando si parla di AI, se ne presentano vantaggi o pericoli, sorvolando su come funzioni davvero. Il risultato è che l'intelligenza artificiale rischia di essere vista come qualcosa di mistico», premette Gilli. «In realtà il suo funzionamento è abbastanza semplice». Nelle sue declinazioni d'intelligence, come quelle utilizzate da Israele, l'AI «analizza grandi quantità di dati per svolgere, sostanzialmente, due tipi di lavoro. Da una parte il pattern recognition, l'identificazione – cioè – di ricorrenze che possano fornire informazioni rilevanti dal punto di vista militare». Dall'altra, «l'anomaly detection, il rilevamento di anomalie, che – per ragioni esattamente opposte all'identificazione di ricorrenze – diano informazioni altrettanto importanti».\nAndiamo più in dettaglio. Da dove vengono questi dati? «Generalmente da una serie di sensori, posizionati su satelliti, droni o a terra. Questi possono essere di vario tipo, come quelli elettromagnetici (dispositivi elettro-ottici, termici, infrarossi, laser o radar) o acustici (microfoni)». Altri dati, poi, cadono nelle mani dell'intelligence attraverso il mondo digitale, «come gli scambi su WhatsApp o la geolocalizzazione dei cellulari». Tutto questo materiale, continua Gilli, «viene consegnato a strumenti di machine learning che sfruttano algoritmi per svolgere i due compiti già citati». Nel caso dell'anomaly detection, l'AI lavora per «identificare qualcosa che, a livello statistico, è significativamente diverso da tutto il resto, un'anomalia appunto». Gilli cita il caso dei palloni aerostatici che, comparsi improvvisamente nei cieli americani nel 2023, avevano posto in allerta il Pentagono. Ma di esempi ce ne sono tanti. «L'improvvisa identificazione, da parte di sensori termici, di un oggetto che emette calore in una notte altrimenti buia rappresenta un'informazione di potenziale interesse». Il grande vantaggio del machine learning, sottolinea l'esperto, «è che lavora a una sensibilità nemmeno immaginabile per occhio e cervello umano. Può, insomma, percepire anomalie che un operatore esperto rischierebbe di perdere».\nLo stesso ragionamento vale per il pattern recognition, spiega Gilli. «Prendiamo il caso israeliano. Una profilazione statistica della messaggistica di WhatsApp permette di abbinare a catene di scambi ai quali partecipa anche un membro accertato di Hamas, una probabilità che anche il mittente iniziale abbia legami con il gruppo islamista». Tutto può essere usato come indicazione di ricorrenze: «Frequenza dei messaggi, orario di spedizione, tempistica rispetto a un attacco compiuto da Hamas. Se il profilo di utenza è molto simile a quello di un capo del gruppo, aumentano le probabilità che anche il soggetto in questione sia un leader di Hamas».\nEvitare errori\nSi tratta, ovviamente, di semplificazioni: il processo per la definizione di un bersaglio va al di là delle attività su un servizio di messaggistica. Certo è che l'utilizzo di AI, sempre nel caso israeliano, ha portato a una grande velocizzazione del processo di designazione degli obiettivi militari. Attivata già nel conflitto israelo-palestinese del 2021, l'intelligenza artificiale Habsora permette – come spiegato dall'allora leader dell'IDF Aviv Kohavi – di generare 100 obiettivi al giorno, contro i 50 inseriti nella banca dati dell'esercito israeliano, tramite lavoro condotto da analisti umani, nel giro di un intero anno. Una vera e propria impennata che ha causato l'allarme di esperti di etica e di diritto internazionale umanitario. Andando oltre il caso israeliano, l'intelligenza artificiale è adatta all'uso bellico? Secondo Mauro Gilli è tutta questione di come la si usa. «Prendiamo il machine learning nei sistemi di difesa antiaerea. La sua applicazione ha drasticamente aumentato l'efficacia di queste armi e ridotto significativamente i casi di \"fuoco amico\", l'abbattimento di aerei delle proprie forze armate. Con questi algoritmi, la distruzione di veicoli alleati o commerciali avviene raramente e in casi, come quello di dicembre in Russia, in cui questi sistemi di difesa sono obsoleti e utilizzati da personale poco addestrato o appena dislocato nell'area». Lungi dall'elevare l'intelligenza artificiale a un mezzo infallibile e dallo sminuire l'importanza delle domande etiche sull'AI, sottolinea Gilli, «utilizzo e risultati sono principalmente determinati da scelte politiche. Il livello di probabilità che un bersaglio militare si riveli tale può essere affinato, così come può essere ridotto il margine di errore accettabile». Basta, insomma, stringere le maglie della \"rete algoritmica\", così da non catturare, e colpire, i bersagli sbagliati. L'uomo, insomma, rimane fondamentale. Non per l'affidabilità (o inaffidabilità) dell'AI. Ma perché essa, come strumento, sia utilizzato nei limiti dell'etica. «È totalmente legittimo sottolineare l'importanza del ruolo umano nelle decisioni di guerra. Ma, contemporaneamente, bisogna evitare, con questa argomentazione, di attribuire all'AI le responsabilità di eventuali errori o scelte politiche discutibili».\nPassato e futuro\nL'applicazione del machine learning nel contesto bellico è, in ogni caso, tutt'altro che recente. «Pur con i limiti tecnologici dell'epoca, sistemi simili sono stati utilizzati sin dagli anni Cinquanta-Sessanta. La guerra sottomarina, ad esempio, ha portato lo sviluppo di sonar che funzionano, sostanzialmente, come le attuali applicazioni di riconoscimento musicale, quali Shazam. Raccolte informazioni dall'ambiente grazie a un sensore, un algoritmo con una banca dati di ritorni acustici permetteva, già allora, di determinare se il segnale catturato appartenesse a sottomarini sovietici o americani». Similmente, l'applicazione di algoritmi «ha permesso all'aeronautica americana di effettuare ingaggi a lunghissimo raggio, impossibili fino alla guerra del Vietnam, quando i caccia dovevano ancora confermare l'identità di altri velivoli tramite il riconoscimento visivo».\nInsomma, sottolinea l'esperto, come è successo in passato, «è ragionevole pensare che il machine learning e l'AI possano funzionare bene, in campo militare, anche in futuro».\nA proposito di futuro. In quali campi della guerra verrà, sempre più, utilizzata l'AI? «Sarà importante nello sviluppo di sistemi d'arma e, da un punto di vista logistico, nella manutenzione dei mezzi. Immagino, ad esempio, un algoritmo che riesca a predire il momento ottimale per rimpiazzare componenti cruciali per il funzionamento di veicoli militari. Ma giocherà un ruolo centrale – come già attualmente, del resto – soprattutto nell'intelligence».",

    "title": "Denmark opposes Israel arms embargo as UK wavers",
    "text": "[ Middle East ](https://www.stripes.com/theaters/middle_east/) Denmark opposes Israel arms embargo as UK wavers the Globes August 22, 2024 (Tribune News Service) — International human rights organizations in collaboration with pro-Palestinian legal groups have recently been trying to change the policies through legal petitions of Denmark and the U.K. — two of the last European countries that have not yet announced an arms embargo on Israel. While the Danish parliament had previously resolutely rejected a proposal to stop the export of arms and spare parts to Israel, in the U.K., the new Labor government indicated that it is considering imposing a ban on the sale of arms to Israel in the coming days. The petitions are part of a legal battle waged by pro-Palestinian and human rights organizations in Europe against Israel since the outbreak of the war in Gaza. The prominent organizations active in the struggle in Europe are Al-Haq, Amnesty, Oxfam and Human Rights Watch. Local pro-Palestinian organizations. The initial achievement of this alliance was a ban imposed by a Dutch court last February on the supply of spare parts for F-35 aircraft from military warehouses in the country to Israel, due to concerns that this would “put the Netherlands at risk of responsibility for committing war crimes in Gaza.” In France, a legal coalition in which some of these organizations are members succeeded in June, through a ruling by a local court in the provincial town of Bobigny, to prevent the entry of anyone connected to Israeli defense industry companies to the Eurosatory weapons exhibition. “Israel has the right to defend itself” While Italy, Spain, Belgium and other countries voluntarily announced the suspension of defense exports to Israel due to the war, several countries on the continent took a different line. The Danish government has demonstrated a relatively pro-Israeli policy since the beginning of the war, among other things ,due to the purchase of advanced weapons systems from Israel in the past year and the Scandinavian country’s close ties with the U.S. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen repeated stated publicly that Israel “has the right to defend itself.” Frederiksen even came to the defense of the Jewish community in the country after some pro-Palestinian demonstrations turned became anti-Semitic. At the end of May, the Danish Parliament rejected by a large majority (84 to 11) an opposition proposal to halt the export of arms and security equipment to Israel. In Denmark, it is mainly about parts for F-35 aircraft that are produced in the country, and which have been exported to the Israel Air Force in recent months. A previous petition by the organizations in Denmark was rejected, but in recent days a petition was submitted to a civil court in Copenhagen, in which it is claimed that the continued export of parts for the F-35 aircraft operated by the Israeli Air Force may “cause Denmark to take part in the commission of war crimes, contrary to its international obligations.” The petitioners are asking for the court to prevent this. Foreign Minister Rasmussen responded strongly to the petition again, saying that the country’s courts “have no mandate” to determine whether the export of this or that part is a legitimate government activity or not. “Denmark is not to blame” for exporting weapons that violate international law, Rasmussen clarified. Challenging the Danish government’s position, Amnesty, according to a report on the petition in the Danish newspaper “Politiken”, claims that the Danish courts can and should verify that the government’s policy is “in accordance with international law”. The legal position of the Danish government is that the organizations have no right to sue it in courts. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, one of the defendants, asks that the court dismiss outright the lawsuit filed in recent days. Testimonies from Gaza on the petition against arms exports In the U.K., the four prominent organizations active on the matter in Europe were joined by the Global Legal Action Network in a petition to the Supreme Court, asking that the government stop all military exports to Israel. Similar to the petition in Denmark, it is also a demand to stop the export of spare parts and F-35 parts, due to allegations of “war crimes and violation of international law” in Gaza. “The Guardian” reported on Tuesday that the organizations are expected to present to the court testimonies from Western doctors who were in Gaza as well as from local families affected by the air force bombings. The petitioners are seeking an immediate halt to British exports, which have anyway reportedly been reduced to just defense equipment worth a few millions of pounds, compared with much larger amounts in the past. The petition is expected to be heard between October 8 and 10. A government decision could precede the court hearing. British Foreign Minister David Lammy, who has visited Israel several times since his appointment to the position last month, said that he had initiated a “new legal investigation” that would examine whether Israel is actually committing or is suspected of committing war crimes as part of its war in Gaza. He told the media that he did this on his first day in office in early July. A positive answer to this question could lead the British government to immediately declare an arms embargo. Various reports in the last few weeks in the U.K. media revealed that in several cases the British Ministry of Trade has already frozen arms export requests on the grounds that “the issue is under consideration.” However, the British government has stated in recent days that “there is no change in the export policy towards Israel.” Published by Globes, Israel business news — en.globes.co.il — on August 22, 2024. © Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd., 2024.

De momento no se conocen los detalles de la propuesta, ni la postura de las autoridades israelíes. Parecía que las negociaciones indirectas entre Hamás e Israel para lograr un alto el fuego en la Franja de Gaza estaban estancadas, después de que el primer ministro israelí, [Benjamín Netanyahu](https://www.wradio.com.co/2024/05/05/netanyahu-israel-no-puede-aceptar-el-fin-de-la-guerra-en-gaza/), rechazara ayer poner fin a la guerra, demanda clave del grupo islamista. Esta mañana, de hecho, miles de palestinos en la localidad sureña de Rafah recibieron mensajes instándolos a evacuar a la zona de Jan Yunis, haciendo saltar las alarmas ante la posibilidad de que el Ejército comience pronto con su anunciada invasión terrestre en el sur de Gaza. El grupo islamista advirtió hoy a las fuerzas israelíes de que cualquier operación militar en Rafah “no será un picnic”, y que el brazo armado del grupo, las Brigadas al Qasam, están preparadas para “defender a nuestro pueblo”. Hamás pidió además a los organismos internacionales que todavía operan en el enclave, y en particular a la agencia de la [ONU](https://www.wradio.com.co/2024/04/02/onu-al-menos-32-prisioneros-de-guerra-ucranianos-han-sido-ejecutados-por-autoridades-rusas/) para los refugiados palestinos (UNRWA), que no lo abandonen tras las órdenes de evacuación israelíes.",
