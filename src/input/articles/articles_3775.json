    "text": "Woodworker in Bennet gives wood a second life with small business BENNET, Neb. (KOLN) - Sometimes what you need to get a job done, may not be too far from home. A woodworker in Bennet uses locally-sourced wood to create kitchen items as well as beautiful custom made pieces with his own hands. “A piece of wood can have more than one purpose,” said Nathan Nelson, owner of [Rooted Woodworking](https://www.facebook.com/rootedwoodworking/). “It’s functional for many years, until weather and elements take its toll on it.” Nathan gives weathered wood a second life as planters, pens, ice cream scoops, honey dippers and cutting boards. It’s a hobby that’s followed him since taking classes in junior high and high school. Nathan said his faith in God inspired him to start his small business in 2013. “And that’s kind of the basis of how I want to run this business - root in Him, overflowing with the gratitude of the gifts that he has provided me with to do this sort of thing,” Nathan said. Alongside utensils, the craftsman also tackles personalized projects. He framed a fireplace for Tim Judge. “His measurements and drawings were so accurate that he was spot on,” Judge said. “And I really was shocked when he brought it in and put it together - how seamless it all was.” No job is too big or too small. Nathan even designed awards for alumni of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Marching Band. “I’m a sucker for handmade artisan work, and that was something that we decided that we wanted as a board, instead of the plain old plaques,” said Elizabeth Chase, UNL Marching Band alum. “We wanted something unique and different.” Nathan and his wife Kristin both marched in the band, making the awards a full circle moment for the couple. “He’s had the opportunity to turn it into his livelihood,” Kristin Nelson said. “And so it’s been neat to watch it grow from one little thing to now a variety of things - doing it well.” Nelson creates rolling pins, pizza cutters, picture frames, egg holders and many other items that add to the popularity of the “farmhouse style.” Rooted Woodworking is sold at [ Antique Anthology](https://www.1011now.com/2024/06/01/antique-shop-offers-small-town-charm-big-city-style-bennet/) in Bennet and [ Anchor Meadow Farm](https://www.1011now.com/2024/02/05/small-farm-milford-raises-breed-pig-new-zealand/) outside of Milford.

    "text": "El abogado del expresidente de la Generalitat Carles Puigdemont, Gonzalo Boye, ha asegurado este jueves por la noche que su defendido \"se ha ido a su casa, donde tiene su lugar de trabajo\", tras su regreso, aunque sin precisar si se refiere al domicilio en el que reside desde hace casi 7 años en Bélgica. En declaraciones a TV3 publicadas en su portal y recogidas por Europa Press, el letrado ha dicho que cuando Puigdemont terminó su discurso en Barcelona minutos antes del pleno para investir a Salvador Illa (PSC) presidente de la Generalitat, su defendido se fue a casa \"como hace todo el mundo cuando termina de trabajar\" y, desde ese momento no ha vuelto a hablar con él. Así lo ha expresado a las puertas de la Ciutat de la Justícia, donde ha asistido jurídicamente al segundo de los dos mossos detenidos este mismo jueves en el dispositivo policial para localizar al expresidente, y sobre el que ha dicho que \"ya están tardando en dejar en libertad\" porque no hay ningún delito en el Código Penal que recoja estos hechos. Sobre si el expresidente tiene previsto llegar a un acuerdo con los Mossos d'Esquadra para pactar una detención, Boye ha respondido que Puigdemont \"no se entregará nunca\". \"Ha dicho que vendría a la investidura y yo creo que ha participado de manera clara\", ha dicho sobre la breve visita del expresidente, que ha logrado burlar un dispositivo de seguridad en el que su abogado ha dicho textualmente que hubo nerviosismo y se ha detenido a diestro y siniestro.

    "title": "Dual Interest Rates for Green Lending: A Financial Revolution in the Fight Against Climate Change",
    "text": "In an age where climate change and sustainable development command global attention, a groundbreaking financial concept is making waves across the world's leading economies. The idea of dual interest rates for green lending proposes a novel approach to combat environmental degradation by incentivizing investments in renewable energy through favorable borrowing costs. This initiative, now under the microscope of major central banks including the European Central Bank (ECB), the Federal Reserve, and the Bank of England, suggests a future where financial mechanisms could significantly bolster efforts against global warming.\nThe Dawn of Green Interest Rates\nAt the heart of this financial innovation is the potential introduction of green interest rates by the ECB, a move that could reshape the landscape of green investment. The concept, which involves offering lower interest rates for projects that meet specific environmental criteria, aims to accelerate the transition to a sustainable economy by making green projects more financially attractive. This initiative is not just a testament to the evolving role of central banks in addressing climate change but also a reflection of the increasing urgency to support sustainable development through every available channel.\nNavigating the Challenges of Green Taxonomy\nHowever, the road to implementing dual interest rates for green lending is fraught with challenges, chief among them being the development of a robust green taxonomy. This framework is crucial for distinguishing genuinely sustainable projects from those that merely claim to be, thereby preventing greenwashing. The controversy surrounding existing green lending programs highlights the intricacies of defining what constitutes a 'green' project, exemplifying the broader struggle to align financial mechanisms with environmental objectives. As central banks venture into this uncharted territory, the importance of establishing clear, universally accepted criteria for green lending cannot be overstated.\nA Call to Action\nThe discourse surrounding dual interest rates for green lending is further enriched by the insights of ECB Governing Council member Francois Villeroy de Galhau, who emphasizes the urgency of not delaying interest rate cuts. His advice underlines the central bank's commitment to maintaining control over the pace and extent of policy easing following the initial move. This stance is indicative of a broader recognition of the critical role financial policies play in addressing climate change, serving as a call to action for central banks worldwide to adopt innovative approaches like green interest rates.\nAs we stand on the brink of potentially transformative changes in the world of finance, the concept of dual interest rates for green lending offers a glimpse into a future where economic mechanisms are fully aligned with the imperative of sustainability. The consideration of such policies by the ECB, Federal Reserve, and Bank of England marks a significant step forward in the global fight against climate change. However, the journey ahead is complex, requiring meticulous planning, unwavering commitment, and collaborative effort to ensure that green finance can indeed fulfill its promise as a catalyst for environmental stewardship. In navigating these challenges, the role of central banks is evolving, underscoring their influence not just on the economy, but on the very health of our planet.",
