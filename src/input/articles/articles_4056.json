    "title": "USDA Raises Corn Yield Forecast To Record Levels For 2024",
    "text": "about 1 hour ago • 1 min What’s going on here? The USDA has set a new record with its corn yield forecast at 183.8 bushels per acre for 2024, echoing the rising trends last seen in 2014. This surge in production emerges amid ongoing adjustments to corn [stocks](/glossary/stock) and market speculations. What does this mean? The USDA's upbeat yield prediction is reminiscent of 2014, when yields climbed monthly to set fresh records. Despite the higher yields, ending stocks for 2023-24 are at a four-year high, yet they still fell short of expectations due to underestimated demand. There's skepticism around the USDA's forecasted 14% increase in 2024-25 stocks, indicating a cautious stance. At the Chicago Board of Trade, corn futures mirrored a similar pattern of [volatility](/glossary/volatility) from a decade ago, falling more than 9% in June 2024 amid a robust harvest outlook, before slightly rebounding in September amid global crop concerns. The mood among speculators is also shifting, as 2024's bearish positions are now easing, with money managers turning less bearish than in previous months. Why should I care? For markets: Corn's turbulent ride to stability. Investors should consider the similarities between 2014 and now, as current conditions hint at potential price rallies, particularly if 2024-25 ending stocks dip below the important 2 billion bushel threshold. Market volatility is further swayed by evolving speculative positions, pointing to possible movements as we near the year's end. The bigger picture: A familiar forecasting challenge. Globally, the impact of US yield changes is significant. As the world observes the US's bumper crop year, subtle shifts in forecasts and stock levels can trigger ripples across international markets, affecting trade balances and global food security strategies.

    "text": "DETROIT – The Quick Lane Bowl announced today that it has invested $7,000 in education at [Detroit Lions Academy](https://www.detroitk12.org/domain/1851) as part of the new Touchdown for Teachers Initiative. A joint effort by the College Football Playoff (CFP) Foundation and ESPN, the two entities have come together to donate $1,000 to local schools for every touchdown scored during each bowl game during the 2023 Bowl Season. The Quick Lane Bowl saw seven touchdowns in the game this year, resulting in a total of $7,000 from the CFP Foundation and ESPN. These funds will be directly donated to teachers at Detroit Lions Academy. This grant is a continuation of the Quick Lane Bowl's investment in education in the local Detroit community. In September, the Quick Lane Bowl, the College Football Playoff Foundation and the Detroit Lions Foundation donated $30,000 to the Detroit Lions Academy for an updated media center. The Detroit Lions Academy is a public school within the Detroit Public School Community District. Over the summer, three schools merged to serve students in grades 6-12 who have faced learning hurdles or that need credit recovery assistance. The new school and its teachers are dedicated to giving these students a second chance at receiving an education by providing a structure that allows them to graduate on time. The entire 29-member faculty at DLA is dedicated to helping the students overcome the odds caused by socioeconomic barriers that hamper their ability to learn. \"Having the Quick Lane Bowl as a platform to invite collegiate programs into the City of Detroit as well as serving the greater community during Bowl Week and beyond is an honor,\" said Director of the Quick Lane Bowl and Events Tamarah Tabor. \"The new Touchdown for Teachers initiative furthers our work with the incredible educators at Detroit Lions Academy and ensures our local students continue to receive the resources they need to be successful.\" The College Football Playoff Foundation is the largest sports entity in America that is supporting education. Its nationwide Extra Yard for Teachers platform has collectively invested approximately $68 million in support of education. The Extra Yard for Teachers platform is successful in supporting and uplifting teachers by focusing on four major areas: Recognition, Resources, Professional Development, Recruitment and Retention. Since its inception, the CFP Foundation has supported more than 500,000 teachers nationwide, creating a positive impact for more than 9.2 million students and 50,000 schools. \"Our partnership with the Quick Lane Bowl has been simply outstanding in our efforts to support teachers and celebrate their important roles with our children,\" said CFP Foundation Executive Director Britton Banowsky. \"We couldn't have the nationwide reach we have without our wonderful partners throughout the country. We are so thankful to the Quick Lane Bowl and the difference it is making for educators.\" For more information about the CFP Foundation, visit [www.cfp-foundation.org](http://www.cfp-foundation.org/).",

The \"days of resistance\" aim to \"hold Amazon accountable for [labor] abuses, environmental degradation and threats to democracy,\" according to organizers UNI Global Union and Progressive International. \"No matter how much they spend to fight us, corporations like Amazon cannot break the power of workers standing together,\" UNI Global Union’s General Secretary Christy Hoffman said in a statement shared with FOX Business. \"In Germany, ver.di has led the charge for over a decade, demanding collective bargaining rights — a fight that resonates across the globe.

The striking workers will be supported by various unions, anti-poverty and garment worker rights groups and others, according to UNI Global Union. Amazon, in a statement to FOX Business, accused the organizers of being \"intentionally misleading\" and promoting a \"false narrative.\" A worker pulls a pallet at an Amazon fulfillment center in Swansea, Wales.

While the dust settles on the recruiting ⁤frenzy, several teams emerged‌ as clear winners, securing top talent⁤ and bolstering their rosters for the 2025 season.\nAmong the standout performers was Michigan,⁣ which enjoyed a‌ remarkable surge in recruiting rankings. “Michigan surged,”⁤ noted ‌ESPN, highlighting ⁢the Wolverines’ impressive haul of ​highly ‍sought-after prospects. This success solidifies⁢ Michigan’s position as a force to ⁤be reckoned with in the ⁣ Big Ten ‌and beyond.\nMeanwhile, USC faced some challenges on the ​recruiting ⁣trail.ESPN pointed out that the⁣ Trojans‌ “have issues,” suggesting that their recruiting efforts may not have met expectations. This could pose a hurdle ⁢for USC as they aim to maintain their competitive edge in the Pac-12.\nRivals.com offered a complete analysis of the‍ Big Ten’s recruiting ⁤performance, providing insightful grades for each team. Their detailed breakdown sheds light on the strengths and weaknesses of various programs within the conference.\nNational signing Day 2024 has undoubtedly reshaped the landscape of⁢ college football recruiting.⁣ The teams that secured⁤ top talent have positioned themselves for future success, while others will need to⁣ regroup and strategize for the next ​recruiting cycle.\nthe early signing period for the 2024 college football recruiting class has come to a ⁢close, leaving ⁢a landscape ⁤of ​winners ⁣and losers in ‌its wake.Top programs solidified their rosters with‌ elite talent,while others scrambled to fill gaps and salvage their classes.\n“It’s ‍a big day for ​college‍ football,” said one recruiting analyst. “These early signings give us a glimpse into the ⁢future of the sport and⁣ highlight the programs ⁣that are building for sustained success.”\nAmong the‍ clear winners​ were perennial powerhouses like Alabama, Georgia, and Ohio State. These​ schools consistently attract top ​recruits and ​this year was no exception. They secured ⁢commitments from ⁢some⁢ of the nation’s most sought-after prospects, further cementing their status as college⁣ football royalty.\nHowever, the early signing​ period also ‍saw some surprising developments.Several programs that typically fly under the radar made critically important splashes, landing‌ commitments from highly-rated recruits.This influx of talent could signal a shift in the​ balance of power in college football.\nOn the flip side, some established ⁣programs struggled to meet expectations. They faced stiff​ competition for top recruits and were left scrambling to ⁢fill key positions. The early signing period exposed vulnerabilities in their recruiting strategies and could have long-term implications for their on-field ​performance.\nAs the dust settles on the early signing ⁣period, the focus‍ now shifts to the February signing day.

    "text": "As artificial intelligence continues to advance at a rapid pace, its benefits and risks are becoming more apparent, according to Arvind Narayanan, Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University. Speaking at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit, Professor Narayanan discussed the growing influence of AI, its potential pitfalls, and the necessary steps for responsible use and regulation.Professor Narayanan acknowledged the transformative potential of AI, especially with its increasing accessibility.\\\"AI has many benefits, but it also has risks. AI being widely available to consumers is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, for the first time in recent years, anyone can now access really powerful AI systems, which were previously only available to companies and governments,\\\" he said.Also Read: ‘Congress misled people... we will easily win Maharashtra polls’: Nitin GadkariThis democratisation of AI, he believes, offers unprecedented opportunities for individuals and small enterprises. However, he also highlighted that this widespread availability can be a double-edged sword, bringing new challenges, including misuse and ethical concerns.\\\"It's not a matter of saying everybody should use these tools responsibly. There will always be bad actors and we need regulation to address them,\\\" he said.Generative AIAI systems, especially generative models, have made significant strides in recent years. However, they still face serious challenges, including issues related to bias and “hallucinations” — when AI systems produce incorrect or fabricated information.Narayanan spoke about generative AI being trained primarily on Western text and images, leading to limitations in tasks like Indian language processing. He noted improvements in reducing hallucinations through web-retrieval and summarization.\\\"In the last couple of years, a lot of progress has been made on the issue of bias. For instance, one type of bias occurs when generative AI is primarily trained on text and images from the Western world. As a result, it may not perform well in tasks like speaking Indian languages or accurately representing the culture of many countries,\\\" he said.",
