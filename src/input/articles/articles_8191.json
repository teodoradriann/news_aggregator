    "text": "Video: Woman does yoga with snakes in California studio, slammed A woman was criticised on social media after a video of her performing 'snake yoga' at a studio in California went viral. Listen to Story In Short - Woman criticised for 'snake yoga' in California - Video by content creator Jen Zhang went viral - Social media users called it 'animal abuse' A woman was brutally slammed by social media users for doing ‘snake yoga’ at a studio in California. Jen Zhang, a content creator from Los Angeles, documented her experience in a video on Instagram that has gone viral with close to one million views. In the video, Zhang was seen practising yoga on a mat in the studio with a snake coiled around her neck. Ahead of the yoga session spanning over an hour, she was instructed regarding the procedure that involved non-toxic ball pythons. “This is the only place where you can do snake yoga. It is an hour-long experience where you are paired with your own snake, and you do a snake incorporated yoga routine. I thought it sounded absolutely insane. So, I booked it immediately. When you get there, your instructor and snake handler will give a hands-on rundown on how to handle the snakes properly. Then, you pick a gem randomly. Each one corresponds to one of their eight snakes, and you get to keep the gem as a souvenir. These are non-toxic ball pythons,” she said in the video. Describing her experience, Zhang said that though she was nervous in the beginning, she was eventually able to concentrate. “I am low-key, a little scared of snakes and have never held one before, so I didn’t know how this was going to go. I started out pretty nervous. But just in case, snakes can smell fear. I compartmentalised that fear to the back of my soul and definitely got comfy as the class went on. It helps that snakes are super slow. They are also under three pounds and are very smooth and gentle compared to snakeless yoga. I felt a lot more concentrated,” she added. Watch the video here: Social media users, however, were furious and said that this was nothing but “animal abuse”. “Stop treating animals like commodities or accessories (sic),” a user said, while others emphasised that this isn’t yoga at all. “There is NO animal companionship in yoga. Call it stretching with snakes, but it’s not yoga at all. Do some research before blatantly disrespecting an ancient wellness practice (sic).” “Personally, I don't agree with using animals in yoga. They're not an exercise accessory and add unnecessary risk (sic),” a comment reads. Also called the royal python, the ball python is a species native to West and Central Africa, where it lives in grasslands, shrubs and forests.",

    "title": "Canada ‘will be there’ to help 2 Michaels after their detention in China: Trudeau",
    "text": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is pushing back on the notion that Canada’s willingness to help two citizens who were detained in China is an acknowledgement they engaged in espionage on Ottawa’s behalf. The federal government will be there to help Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor rebuild their lives after they were arbitrarily imprisoned in China for three years, Trudeau said Thursday. Canada has assisted Kovrig and Spavor from the beginning because China chose to use them as pawns in geopolitical games, Trudeau told a news conference in Toronto. “We’ve been there to support the two Michaels, who went through unimaginable difficulties, being arbitrarily detained by China,” he said. “We will continue to be there to support them.” He said China arrested the Canadians for political reasons, adding there was “absolutely no justification, no reason, no excuse for them to do that.” Trudeau’s comments came a day after John Phillips, a lawyer for Spavor, indicated his client had reached a settlement with the federal government over the detention. Phillips said in an email that the matter between Spavor and the government had been “resolved.” Trudeau declined to say Thursday whether Ottawa had provided compensation to Kovrig, citing a need for confidentiality. Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive of Chinese firm Huawei Technologies, in December 2018 at the request of the United States, where she faced charges related to American sanctions against Iran. The move clearly angered Beijing, and Kovrig and Spavor — two Canadians working in China — were arrested soon after on accusations of endangering national security, a move widely seen as retaliation against Ottawa. Kovrig and Spavor were both convicted of spying in 2021 in closed Chinese courts. Canada and many allies said the process amounted to arbitrary detention on bogus charges in an unaccountable justice system. The U.S. worked out a deferred prosecution agreement in Meng’s case, allowing for her release, and Beijing permitted the two Michaels, as they came to be known, to fly home in September 2021.

    "text": "PM Modi’s Outreach To Putin Helped Prevent ‘Potential Nuclear Attack’ On Ukraine In Late 2022: CNN Report\nWashington: As the Russia-Ukraine conflict raged in 2022, the United States started “preparing rigorously” for a potential nuclear strike by Moscow against Kyiv, in what would have been the first nuclear attack since the US dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki nearly eighty years before, CNN reported citing two senior administration officials.\nThe report stated that outreach from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other countries also played an important role in averting the crisis.\nThe Biden administration was specifically concerned Russia might use a tactical or battlefield nuclear weapon, the officials said.\nAmid the fears, the US sought to enlist the help of non-allies including India, to discourage Russia from such an attack, as reported by CNN.\n“One of the things we did was not only message them directly but strongly urge, press, encourage other countries, to whom they might be more attentive, to do the same thing,” the senior administration official said.\nUS officials say that outreach and public statements from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and others helped avert a crisis.\n“I think we believe showing the international community the concern about this, particularly the concern from key countries for Russia and the Global South, was also a helpful, persuasive factor and showed them what the cost of all this could be,” CNN quoted a senior administration official as saying.\n“I think the fact that we know, India weighed in, China weighed in, others weighed in, may have had some effect on their thinking,” the senior administration official added. “I can’t demonstrate this positively, but I think that’s our assessment.”\nRegarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict, India has always condemned civilian killings and called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\nIn a major statement, PM Modi told President Putin that “this is not the era of war” on the sidelines of the SCO summit in Uzbekistan last year. The statement even made to the G20 communique under the presidency of India.\nDuring this period from late summer to fall 2022, the National Security Council convened a series of meetings to put contingency plans in place “in the event of either a very clear indication that they were about to do something, attack with a nuclear weapon, or if they just did, how we would respond, how we would try to preempt it or deter it,” the senior administration official said.\nNotably, late summer 2022 was also proving a ‘devastating period’ for Russian forces in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces were advancing on Russian-occupied Kherson in the south, the city which had been Russia’s biggest prize since the invasion.\nAs these Ukrainian forces advanced, entire Russian units were in danger of being surrounded. The view inside the administration was that such a catastrophic loss could be a “potential trigger” for the use of nuclear weapons, according to CNN.\nAlso, at the same time, Russia was allegedly circulating a new “false flag story” about a Ukrainian dirty bomb, which US officials feared could be intended as a cover for a Russian nuclear attack.\nIn October 2022, Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, made a series of phone calls to defence officials in the US, the UK, France and Turkey, telling them that the Kremlin was “concerned about possible provocations by Kyiv involving the use of a dirty bomb.”\nBut, it is pertinent to note that at no time did the US detect intelligence indicating Russia was taking steps to mobilize its nuclear forces to carry out such an attack, CNN reported.\n“We obviously placed a high priority on tracking and had some ability at least to track such movements of its nuclear forces,” a senior administration official said. “And at no point did we ever see any indications of types of steps that we would’ve expected them to take if they were going down a path toward using nuclear weapons.”\nThis report is auto-generated from a syndicated feed\n- SEO Powered Content & PR Distribution.\nGet Amplified Today.\n- PlatoData.Network Vertical Generative Ai.

    "text": "EDP Renewables abandona definitivamente sus parques eólicos en La Guajira pese a aval de la ANLA\nAunque la ANLA dejó en firme la licencia ambiental para la línea eléctrica de conexión en La Guajira, EDP Renewables ratificó su decisión de abandonar el país y no continuar con los parques eólicos Alpha y Beta.\nLa empresa EDP Renewables (EDPR), operadora de los proyectos eólicos Alpha y Beta en el norte de La Guajira, reiteró que no retomará la construcción de estas iniciativas en Colombia, pese a la decisión reciente de la Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales (ANLA) de dejar en firme la licencia ambiental para la infraestructura eléctrica requerida.\nLe puede interesar:\nEn un comunicado, la compañía confirmó que ya fue notificada del acto administrativo mediante el cual la ANLA resolvió el recurso de reposición que EDPR había interpuesto. No obstante, aclaró que la respuesta del ente ambiental no modifica la decisión comunicada desde diciembre de 2024, cuando anunció su salida del mercado colombiano.\n“EDPR ya ha dado inicio al proceso de disolución y liquidación de las sociedades Vientos del Norte y Eolos Energía”, indicó la empresa, que atribuye su retirada a una combinación de factores: retrasos en la emisión de licencias, restricciones de mercado y condiciones que, según afirman, son responsabilidad del Gobierno.\nEl proyecto de interconexión, que busca enlazar los parques eólicos con la subestación Cuestecitas atravesando los municipios de Uribia, Maicao y Albania, había sido catalogado por el Gobierno como clave para la transición energética.\nLa ministra de Ambiente, Lena Estrada, lo definió como “esencial para avanzar hacia una transición energética justa”, mientras que la directora de la ANLA, Irene Vélez, aseguró que la decisión se basó en “criterios técnicos, jurídicos y ambientales”.\nA pesar de su salida, EDPR expresó su disposición a colaborar en un eventual proceso de transferencia de los proyectos hacia un tercero, siempre que se den condiciones adecuadas y que el Gobierno juegue un papel activo para garantizar esa transición.\nDurante su operación en el país, EDPR aseguró haber cumplido con todas sus obligaciones energéticas y contractuales. Sin embargo, la empresa insistió en que las barreras estructurales y los incumplimientos institucionales limitaron el desarrollo del sector eólico, particularmente en La Guajira, donde varios proyectos enfrentan bloqueos similares.",

    "title": "Fate y Bridgestone no acompañaron a Pirelli y la amenaza de conflicto vuelve a la industria del neumático - El Cronista",
    "text": "El fabricante de cubiertas Pirelli presentó este jueves una última propuesta salarial que no sólo fue rechazada por el gremio, sino que tampoco contó con el apoyo de Fate ni de Bridgestone. En consecuencia, el Sindicato Único de Trabajadores del Neumático Argentino (Sutna) dio por rota la negociación paritaria y se declaró en estado de alerta.Hace dos años, el sector protagonizó uno de los conflictos sindicales más feroces de los últimos tiempos, con cinco meses de paros y bloqueos que llevó al freno total de la producción de neumáticos, que también arrastró a la industria automotriz. Hubo paz después de un acuerdo con mecanismos de ajustes que le garantizaron al gremio estar siempre por encima de inflación. Este año, la negociación se fraccionó por períodos. El mes pasado, se había acordado un 4,6% remunerativo y acumulativo para los haberes de junio, calculado sobre los haberes de mayo. Quedaba por definir la suba de julio, a partir de los salarios del mes previo. La negociación paritaria transcurrió en un clima tensionado por los pedidos de apertura de procedimientos preventivos de crisis (PPC) por parte de Fate y de Bridgestone.Este jueves, a través de una audiencia virtual, Pirelli propuso un aumento del 4% acumulativo y remunerativo sobre los valores y adicionales vigentes al 30 de junio, a partir del 1o de julio, con la promesa de continuar analizando la situación mes a mes para la siguientes actualizaciones.Fate y Bridgestone expresaron \"no estar en condiciones\" de acompañarla. \"Tal como venimos advirtiendo hace años, la actividad del neumático, desde hace tiempo, se encuentra atravesando una situación compleja, que combina -entre otras variables- una fuerte contracción de la demanda, pérdidas en el mercado exportador, un auemnto sostenido de los stocks y de los costos operativos, todo ello, dentro de un marco de baja competitividad\", argumentaron.Esto dio pie a la respuesta de Alejandro Crespo, secretario general del Sutna. \"La falta de una propuesta unificada y, por tanto, válida de las patronales, habiendo transcurrido ya un mes y medio sin propuesta salarial válida alguna, rompe la negociación en el caracter de la buena fe y plantea, de hecho, un intento de imprimir una rebaja salarial\", se lee en el acta de la audiencia.\"Por todo esto, el gremio del neumático queda en estado de alerta y movilización\", agregó.Trabajo citó a una nueva audiencia el jueves próximo.La relación del Sutna con las fábricas es de alta inflamabilidad. Crespo se ve seguido las caras con las de los negociadores de las empresas en distintas audiencias, tanto de Trabajo como de autoridades provinciales. El Sutna rechazó los pedidos de PPC de Fate y Bridgestone. Con la japonesa, además, tiene frecuente escaramuzas. Las más recientes, por el planteo de despidos (más de 400), que se presentó como uno de los escenarios a seguir en el proceso del PPC. Aunque la empresa deslizó su intención de no recortar fuentes de trabajo, lo concreto es que recurrió al instrumento -que, bajo el paraguas de Trabajo, le permite flexibilizar condiciones del convenio colectivo- debido a su pérdida de competitividad, en gran parte, gracias a los frecuentes conflictos internos que padece desde aquella gran puja de 2022.Antes de ese conflicto, Bridgestone había invertido u$s 220 millones para ampliar su capacidad de producción. En 2021, tomó 350 personas para sumar un nuevo turno de producción, con miras al incremento de su actividad para exportación. Pero, después de los paros y bloqueos del Sutna de 2022, perdió mercados a manos de otras filiales y, hoy, exporta sólo el 10% de proyectado en su plan de negocios.Por eso, en febrero, ya había despedido a 80 personas, sobre un plantel total de 1600. La fuerte pérdida de volumen de exportación, sumada a la caída del mercado interno, fue la razón principal que la llevó a solicitar el PPC ante la Secretaría de Trabajo.El desplome de entregas domésticas, con la consecuente acumulación de stocks, fue también la razón que alegó Fate en el pedido de apertura de su propio procedimiento.",

NASA’s new space suits are getting a hand from Italian luxury fashion house Prada in preparation for humanity’s 2026 return to the moon’s surface.\nAxiom Space and Prada debuted the flight design of the Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit (AxEMU) spacesuit this week at the International Astronautical Congress in Milan.\nThe suit is expected to be used for NASA’s historic Artemis III mission in 2026, marking humankind’s first return to the moon since 1972.\n“Our elite teams have redefined spacesuit development, establishing new pathways to innovative solutions and applying a state-of-the-art design approach for the AxEMU,” said Matt Ondler, president of Axiom Space. “We have broken the mold.”\nImage courtesy of Prada / Axiom Space / Image courtesy of Prada / Axiom Space / Image courtesy of Prada / Axiom Space Design for the Axiom Space, Prada spacesuit that will see the first woman and person of color land on the moon. The modernized suits are meant foremost to keep astronauts safe in the throes of space’s harsh environment, with improved mobility from earlier designs as a close second mandate.\nIn its release announcing the suit designs, Axiom Space said the suits have improved flexibility, performance and safety and offer specialized tools for scientists’ missions.\nThe suit is one size fits all and includes lights, an HD camera, 4G/LTE communications, and in-suit nutrition.\n“It will withstand extreme temperatures at the lunar south pole and endure the coldest temperatures in the permanently shadowed regions for at least two hours. Astronauts will be able to perform spacewalks for at least eight hours,\" the press release announcing the new design said.\nAmerica has long dreamed about returning its astronauts to the moon, but the U.S. space program has been plagued by technical delays and a lack of funding.\nIn 2019, the Trump administration directed NASA to land humans on the moon’s unexplored southern lunar pole by 2024, with the ultimate goal of eventually landing an earthling on Mars.\nHowever, the program was delayed partly because of failures to meet spacesuit design criteria in time.\nWhen launched, the Artemis III mission will see the first woman and the first person of color traverse the low-gravity lunar surface.\nAxiom Space said the suit is nearing its final development stage and has already completed a critical pressurized simulation, the first since Project Apollo.\nCopyright 2024 NPR\nTags NPR Top Stories Alana Wise Alana Wise is a politics reporter on the Washington desk at NPR.

    "text": "&quot;Manchmal könnte ich so Dialoge führen mit meiner Gebärmutter und sie fragen, was sie eigentlich den ganzen Tag so macht, ob sie eigentlich arbeitslos ist&quot;, sagt Alina in die Kamera. Sie fühlt sich &quot;richtig lost&quot; und ist &quot;sauer auf die ganze Welt&quot;. Zusammen mit ihrem Mann Daniel (38) möchte die 37-Jährige unbedingt noch ein Kind. Für die Real-Life-Serie &quot;Wir wollen ein Baby!&quot; im ZDF gewähren sie den Kameras einen Einblick in ihre schwierige Reise. Eine erste künstliche Befruchtung war vor drei Jahren erfolgreich, doch nun wird es mühsam und schwer. &quot;Damals hatte ich noch eine gewisse Leichtigkeit im Vergleich zu jetzt&quot;, erinnert sie sich. Diese sei schon lange weg. &quot;Ich bin gar nicht mehr der Mensch, der ich vor dieser Kinderwunschreise gewesen bin.&quot; So wie Alina und Daniel geht es auch den vier andere Paaren, die in &quot;Wir wollen ein Baby!&quot; die Zuschauer mit auf ihre Kinderwunschreise nehmen, beim Gynäkologen, im OP-Saal, in der Kinderwunschklinik. Da sind Heike (36) und Dennis (31), die es nach einer Fehlgeburt weiterversuchen wollen, Sabrina (37) und Katharina (41) und Elisa (27) und Noah, die für ihren Kinderwunsch auf Samenspender angewiesen sind, oder Olga (33) und Serge (35), die mit Unfruchtbarkeit kämpfen. &quot;Ich fühle mich kinderlos irgendwie nicht normal&quot;, gibt Olga zu. &quot;Es ist eine Mischung aus Hoffnung und Durchdrehen und Ängsten und Ausraster&quot;, fasst Alina ihre Kinderwunschreise zusammen. Trotzdem machen sie und ihr Mann sich immer wieder auf den Weg in eine Klinik in Prag und probieren es weiter auf natürlichem Weg. &quot;Man ordnet dem Kinderwunsch alles unter&quot;, gesteht Daniel. Es sei &quot;die krasseste Probe für die Partnerschaft&quot;, erklärt Alina. Hohe Kosten für Kinderwunschbehandlungen Die Klinik in Prag hat sich Alina und Daniel auch wegen der hohen Kosten, die Kinderwunschbehandlungen in Deutschland mit sich bringen, ausgesucht. Damit haben auch die anderen Paare zu kämpfen: Für eine hormonelle Selbstbehandlung mit Spritzen, müssen Olga und Serge die Hälfte des Preises selbst zahlen, 558,66 Euro. Um sich die Behandlungen leisten zu können, verzichten sie auf gemeinsame Urlaube. Eine künstliche Befruchtung kostet, je nach Zyklus, zwischen 4.000 und 5.000 Euro, Samenspenden können ebenfalls über 1.000 Euro kosten. &quot;Für uns als Frauenpaar ist es besonders herausfordernd, dass wir immer auf einen Samenspender angewiesen sind&quot;, erklärt Sabrina. Was es für sie zusätzlich schwer macht, ist, dass Krankenkassen bei homosexuellen Paaren mit Kinderwunsch keine der Kosten übernehmen. Belastungsprobe Kinderwunsch: &quot;Du wirst irgendwann gezwungen, diese Zweifel zu haben&quot; Die Zweifel, Trauer und Enttäuschung sind jedoch bei allen Paaren gleich. Nach ihrer Fehlgeburt und aufgrund ihrer Endometriose, die für eine geringere Eizellreserve sorgt, fällt es Heike schwer, &quot;dem Körper Vertrauen zu schenken, dass es gut werden kann&quot;, erklärt sie. Ähnlich geht es Alina. Bereits das siebte Mal versucht sie, mithilfe von künstlicher Befruchtung schwanger zu werden. Das Kamerateam begleitet sie auch dabei und fängt ein, wie sehr sie ihr eigener Wunsch an ihre Grenzen bringt: &quot;Jetzt will ich heim&quot;, sagt sie erschöpft nach einer weiteren OP in Prag. Für Olga und Serge soll es auf ihrer Kinderwunschreise in Zukunft ebenfalls ins Ausland gehen. Bei einer Untersuchung in Spanien soll herausgefunden werden, warum sich Embryonen nicht in Olgas Gebärmutter einnisten. Dass Serge fast unfruchtbar ist, wissen sie bereits. &quot;Das hat mich schon ziemlich belastet&quot;, gibt er zu. Leute aus ihrem Umfeld hätten ihnen sogar geraten, sich deshalb zu trennen. &quot;Du wirst irgendwann gezwungen, diese Zweifel zu haben, an dir selbst, an der Ehe, am Mann&quot;, erklärt Olga. Dennoch halten die beiden zueinander. Endlich ein Kind: &quot;Das war der schönste Tag in meinem Leben&quot; Im Laufe der Serie können Katherina und Sabrina ihre Tochter begrüßen und auch Elisa und Noah werden, nach einem fehlgeschlagenen Versuch, Eltern. &quot;Das war der schönste Tag in meinem Leben!&quot;, da ist sich Sabrina sicher. Bei der Geburt per Kaiserschnitt sind die Kameras dabei und fangen das Glück der jungen Familie ein.

    "text": "The Detroit Red Wings share an arena with the NBA’s Pistons, who just broke the single-season league record for most consecutive losses.\nThe Red Wings aren’t close to matching that run of futility, however it’s been a rough December for them as well. They are 2-8-1 over their last 11 games, including a 6-3 road loss to the Minnesota Wild on Wednesday.\nDetroit will try to turn things around during a pair of home games before the calendar flips to 2024. The Nashville Predators will visit on Friday and the Boston Bruins will come to town on New Year’s Eve.\nThe Red Wings experienced a third-period collapse against the Wild. They tied the game on Alex DeBrincat’s power-play goal before then allowing four goals in less than 10 minutes.\nCoach Derek Lalonde saw it coming.\n“Just our inability to manage our game,” he said. “It’s unbelievable. We were fortunate to come out of the second at 2-1. They had six Grade A’s (chances) in the second and they were all off egregious turnovers. The difference in the third is the puck ended in the back of the net off of turnovers where it did not in the second.”\nDetroit had a 14-7-3 record before its slide began. The Red Wings now are in danger of dropping to the .500 mark with a regulation loss to the Predators.\n“This was not us over the first 25 games,” Lalonde said. “We worked off a forecheck and we were a simple, predictable team. Now, it’s just blue line turnovers, high offensive zone turnovers, it’s disappointing.”\nOne of the few bright spots has been the production of Patrick Kane, who signed with Detroit as a free agent early in the month. He carries a five-game point streak (five goals, four assists) and four-game goal streak into Friday’s contest.\nThe Predators have lost their last two games and three of their last four contests. The Carolina Hurricanes posted a 5-2 win in Nashville on Wednesday.\nAll of the Hurricanes’ goals came during the first two periods.\n“I think we were a little careless at times,” Nashville coach Andrew Brunette said. “I think it was an emotional game. I thought we were excited to play, maybe a little bit too rambunctious a few different times. We took some offensive zone penalties that probably we wouldn’t like to take.”\nCarolina scored three of its goals with the man advantage.\n“Special teams, we lost that battle (Wednesday), which is frustrating,” center Ryan O’Reilly said.\nO’Reilly notched his 14th goal of the season on Wednesday. He trails only Filip Forsberg (16) for the team lead in goals.\n“I thought we did a lot of good things,” O’Reilly said. “Obviously, we’ve got to find a way to put the puck in the net a little bit better. We had some chances. Like I said, myself, I’m better than the shots I was putting on net there. Getting those point-blank opportunities and not putting them in the back of the net, I’m better than that, for sure.”\nNashville and Detroit split its two-game series last season. This will be the first of two meetings this season. The rematch will be held in Nashville on March 23.\n–Field Level Media",
