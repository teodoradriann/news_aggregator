    "text": "A family checking out products at a fireworks retail store ‌in Dinglasan Compound, Barangay Turo, Bocaue, Bulacan. INQUIRER PHOTO/LYN RILLON\nA 4-year-old boy who accidentally swallowed a “watusi,” a legal firecracker that could be easily mistaken for a candy due to its packaging, was among the latest 13 cases of injuries attributed to pyrotechnic devices.\nBased on the latest monitoring of the Department of Health (DOH) on Thursday, the case of the young boy from the Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon) region was the first confirmed case of firecracker ingestion this holiday season.\nADVERTISEMENT Treatment takes time “As of the latest update from the receiving hospital, the family cannot be reached. The DOH appeals to the parents and family of the patient to please return to the hospital for proper medical attention,” the DOH said in a statement. Health Assistant Secretary and DOH deputy spokesperson Albert Domingo stressed the urgency of seeking further medical care in such cases.“Treatment of poisoning takes time, depending on the causative agent and the situation of the patient,” Domingo explained.\nFEATURED STORIES NEWSINFO 14-year-old kills older sister in deadly Christmas gift dispute NEWSINFO Police car veering into bus lane causes road crash on Edsa; 5 hurt NEWSINFO LTO suspends license of overcharging taxi driver Symptoms of watusi poisoning “may manifest in the next few hours and persist for a few days” after ingestion, he added.\nWatusi, which contains yellow phosphorus, potassium chlorate, potassium nitrate and trinitrotoluene, is often confused with candy because of its size and color, the DOH noted.\nFirst-aid measures Under Republic Act. No. 7183, which regulates the sale, manufacture, distribution and use of firecrackers, watusi is described as usually “reddish in color, about 1.5 inches in length and 0.1 inch in width, and usually ignited by friction to produce a dancing movement and a crackling sound.”The DOH advised the public to not induce vomiting if a piece of watusi is swallowed and instead bring the patient immediately to the hospital.\nAnother first-aid measure for children is to make them consume egg whites—from about six to eight raw eggs. For adults, eight to 12 raw eggs may be necessary, it added.\nNationwide monitor The latest cases tallied by the DOH, logged from 6 a.m. of Dec. 27 to 5:59 a.m. of Dec. 28, raised the total number of firecracker-related injuries nationwide to 88, with about a third of them in Metro Manila. The age of the patients range from 5 to 49, with a median of 18 years old.\nThe types of firecrackers so far causing most of the injuries were the “boga,” “5-star,” “kwitis,” “piccolo,” “pla-pla,” “whistle bomb” and “luces.”The majority, or 59 percent, of the injuries were due to the use of firecrackers that are listed as illegal, according to the DOH.

    "text": "Cocoa Police Warn Residents About Increasing Trend of Automated Text Messaging, Spam Robotexts By [Space Coast Daily](https://spacecoastdaily.com/showme/spacecoastdailymaster/) // August 15, 2024 Spam robotexts are now more prevalent than illegal robocalls BREVARD COUNTY, FLORIDA – Automated text messaging has grown more popular, with many companies using robotexts to communicate directly with consumers. Spam robotexts are now more prevalent than illegal robocalls. Robotexts are also used to transmit emergency information, such as inclement weather warnings, school closings and other pertinent information. The Federal Communications Commission bans text messages sent to a mobile phone using an auto-dialer unless the consumer has given consent to receive the message, or the message is sent for emergency purposes. However, illegitimate companies and scammers tend not to heed these rules. Spam robotexts are potentially more dangerous than robocalls because malicious links can be clicked on directly via text. Responding, liking or clicking on the contents of the text will show the scammer that the phone number is active, making the targeted user vulnerable to further messages. Avoid answering texts from unrecognized numbers. Responding to, liking or clicking these messages shows the scammer that the targeted user is active and will lead to more frequent scam messages. – Avoid becoming a victim by doing the following: • Do not click on links in text messages from unknown numbers as they often contain malware or lead to malicious websites. • Consider downloading text and call blocking apps to further prevent these scam texts from reaching a mobile phone. Be sure to do research the apps before downloading to ensure that the app is legitimate. • Know suspicious text messages from a five to six-digit short code telephone number may be a scam, unless the sender has registered the number in the U.S. Short Code Directory and the content of the message matches the registrant.",

Deve minacciare di non iscrivere la Juve' [Leggi](https://www.calciomercato.com/news/chirico-superlega-elkann-cosa-fa-chi-tace-acconsente-e-accontent-44686) La notizia principale che emerge dal testo riguarda la nuova norma della Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (Figc) e le accuse di arroganza rivolte a Aleksander Čeferin, presidente dell'UEFA. Contrariamente a quanto riportato da alcune notizie false circolate recentemente, la Figc non ha introdotto una nuova norma che impone ai club di rinunciare a partecipare a qualsiasi altra competizione non organizzata da loro o dall'UEFA o dalla FIFA, pena l'esclusione da ogni campionato. La norma in questione esiste già ed è stata introdotta nel 2021. Questa norma prevede esattamente quello che avrebbe detto la \"nuova\" norma di cui parlavano le fake news. Aleksander Čeferin, presidente dell'UEFA, è stato accusato di arroganza in seguito alla sentenza della Corte di Giustizia dell'Unione europea sulla Superlega. Secondo Tony Damascelli, giornalista de Il Giornale, Čeferin potrebbe essere talmente arrogante da chiedere la radiazione del presidente della Corte di giustizia. Damascelli sostiene che esiste un gruppo di persone che si ritengono proprietari non solo del calcio, ma anche del lavoro altrui. La sentenza della Corte di Giustizia dell'Unione europea sulla Superlega ha accusato UEFA e FIFA di posizione dominante nell'organizzazione del calcio continentale. Questa sentenza rappresenta un importante punto di svolta nel panorama calcistico europeo e potrebbe avere significative ripercussioni sul futuro del calcio a livello continentale.",

Pero le quiero recordar a esta plenaria que el Pacto Histórico en su integridad votó porque Jorge Tovar estuviera allá sentado”, explicó la representante Katherine Miranda.\n¿Qué dijo Jorge Tovar sobre la polémica?\nPor su parte, Jorge Tovar no dudó en defenderse en cuanto tuvo la oportunidad, agradeciendo a todos los legisladores que lo apoyaron para presidir la plenaria, y tildando de “hipócritas” a aquellos que rechazaron su nombramiento.\n“Quiero agradecerles la solidaridad casi que unánime y el respaldo que me dieron hoy como vicepresidente del Congreso en pleno y presidente encargado de la Cámara de Representantes. Y también decirles a quienes alzaron su voz en contra de que una víctima del conflicto armado esté sentado allí, que con hipocresía y doble moral, jamás vamos a pasar las páginas de la violencia en este país”, dijo el hijo de Jorge 40.\nAun con esta polémica, la sesión prosiguió según la agendada acordada, incluyendo un minuto de silencio por todas las víctimas del conflicto armado en Colombia, y una ofrenda floral.",

    "text": "El sol relucirá en la capital jiennense este lunes, pero lo hará más, si cabe, el Santísimo Sacramento. Jaén celebra este domingo la solemnidad del Corpus Christi, y lo hará con la celebración de la Eucaristía en la Catedral de Jaén y por las calles de la capital. A las 10 de la mañana comenzará la Eucaristía de la solemnidad del Corpus, presidida por el obispo de la Diócesis de Jaén, Sebastián Chico Martínez. Al término de esta, el Santísimo recorrerá las calles de la capital jiennense en su custodia. Además, tal y como vienen siendo habitual, muchos niños y niñas que han recibido su primera comunión este año, acompañarán al Señor en esta procesión. El inicio del cortejo contará con los sones de la Banda de Cornetas y Tambores del Santísimo Cristo de la Expiración y tras la custodia estará la Banda Municipal de Jaén. Además, cofradías y otras instituciones de nuestra tierra conformarán este cortejo que partirá de la Catedral y recorrerá las calles del centro de Jaén. Para una cita de este calibre, la Diócesis de Jaén pide a la jiennenses que engalanen las calles y balcones. En este sentido, la Comisión organizadora del Corpus Christi y la Asociación de Amigos de las Catedrales de Jaén y Baeza han convocado un concurso de altares, balcones, alfombras y escaparates por las zonas en las que discurra la procesión.
