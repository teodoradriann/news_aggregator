    "text": "Alerta: cliclone em formação - saiba o impacto no campo\nFenômeno trará chuvas intensas e generalizadas no final de semana\nNesta quinta-feira, 12 de dezembro de 2024, a frente fria se posiciona na costa do país, promovendo chuvas em áreas que enfrentaram períodos de seca recentemente. De acordo com o meteorologista do Portal Agrolink, Gabriel Rodrigues, as condições climáticas continuam a favorecer a agricultura, especialmente nas regiões produtoras de [soja](https://www.agrolink.com.br/culturas/soja?utm_source=agrolink-detalhe-noticia&utm_medium=detalhe-noticia&utm_campaign=links-internos).\nNo Centro-Oeste, os corredores de umidade garantem chuvas bem distribuídas, essenciais para o desenvolvimento das lavouras de soja. Porém, essas precipitações tendem a ser irregulares em algumas áreas, exigindo atenção dos agricultores no manejo hídrico.\n[Clique aqui e acesse AGROTEMPO](https://www.agrolink.com.br/agrotempo?utm_source=agrolink-detalhe-noticia&utm_medium=detalhe-noticia&utm_campaign=links-internos)\nNo sul da Bahia e no norte de Minas Gerais, as chuvas intensas previstas podem gerar temporais localizados, enquanto a irregularidade na distribuição de precipitação pode desafiar culturas sensíveis à falta de água, como o café e o cacau.\nPor outro lado, o Centro-Sul do Brasil segue com tempo firme, beneficiando o desenvolvimento de culturas como [milho](https://www.agrolink.com.br/culturas/milho?utm_source=agrolink-detalhe-noticia&utm_medium=detalhe-noticia&utm_campaign=links-internos ) e [feijão](https://www.agrolink.com.br/culturas/feijao/?utm_source=agrolink-detalhe-noticia&utm_medium=detalhe-noticia&utm_campaign=links-internos), que estão em fases de crescimento. Estados como São Paulo, Paraná e Rio Grande do Sul apresentam condições favoráveis para o trabalho de campo, com temperaturas moderadas e menos riscos de excesso de umidade.\nO destaque climático para os próximos dias é a formação de um sistema de baixa pressão ao norte da Argentina e no sul do Paraguai, que pode evoluir para um ciclone no oceano. Este fenômeno trará chuvas intensas e generalizadas no final de semana, impactando positivamente as lavouras no Centro-Oeste e em partes do Sudeste, enquanto outras regiões devem monitorar possíveis excessos.",

    "text": "9 Ways to Pass on Your Faith through Family Milestones The Best Inheritance Your faith is your children’s best possible inheritance. Pass it on to them as often and thoroughly as you can. Since faith grows, expands, and multiplies, there will always be enough for every one of your potential descendants. There are many ways you can make milestones special opportunities to pass on your faith. Here is a short list of examples for you to consider as you approach making a “milestone plan.” 1. Heirlooms and Mementos Consider what physical items you might give to your children as a symbol of their Christian heritage. This is not commodifying your legacy; this is reminding them of their part in Christ’s. This could be a family keepsake, a cross necklace, a purity ring, a new Bible, a letter, a pocketknife, a tool, or their first (fill-in-the-blank). Maybe you have something that was handed down to you that you can hand down to them in order to remind them of the family tradition of faithfulness to your God. Giving a gift may also serve as a symbol of a day worth remembering. Connect the gift with an important event so that they will see it and associate it with what the Lord has done. Similar to the way a bride and groom exchange rings on their wedding day to remind one another of their vows, you can give your children objects that will remind them of the covenant relationship they have with God. [Family Discipleship](/books/family-discipleship-case/) [Matt Chandler](/authors/matt-chandler/), [Adam Griffin](/authors/adam-griffin/) Here is a book written for parents that focuses not on their inability, but on God’s ability to help raise their children in the faith through a guided framework focusing on time, moments, and milestones. 2. Rituals and Traditions Decorating a Christmas tree, singing “Happy Birthday,” hunting for Easter eggs—these are all common family traditions. Creating annual traditions infused with gospel truth is a great way to hand down your faith to your children. Traditions are a customary practice that you pass on to your kids by habitually acting them out together. Similarly, rituals are the established way you practice your religion collectively. Traditions and rituals are an important aspect of milestones since they happen repeatedly and repetition leads both to learning and to remembrance. Find ways to create and foster new family traditions that communicate your faith in the God of the Bible. A rite of passage is a significant ritual that communicates the shift from childhood to adulthood. We described what this looks like in the Chandler house earlier in this chapter. Rituals are powerful opportunities because they go beyond the normal rhythm of your family into something momentous. Some churches have ceremonies like this built into their rhythms, like the rite of confirmation or a purity ceremony. We highly recommend making a rite-of-passage ceremony a part of your milestone plan. 3. Events and Experiences Creating an experience can take an ordinary event in a person’s life and elevate it to something extraordinary. Think about all the engagement stories you have ever heard. Most of them do not involve the simple gift of a ring. There is something about the elaborate nature of the surprise that communicates genuine love and thoughtfulness. The more the man uniquely caters the fanfare to the bride, the more she appreciates his effort and the more clearly his affection is communicated. Think of your children’s family discipleship milestones in the same way. How can you turn a time of recognizing or celebrating what the Lord has done into an event or an experience they will never forget? Would they love to find the keys to their first car at the end of a scavenger hunt you designed? Would they appreciate going out to lunch at their favorite restaurant and receiving a cross necklace after their first time taking Communion? Would they be delighted by a letter or toast from you about your parental pride, heartfelt prayers, and trust as you allow them to start dating? How can you make their first school dance, church retreat, graduation, wedding, mission trip, or first day at a new job a spiritually influential event? 4. Crafts and Projects If you are crafty or handy, consider how making or building something together could be part of a milestone for your child. Finishing a functional or artistic project can be a great memory-forming activity for your family. Your finished product is a testament to time spent together and the lessons and messages learned along the way. Your faith is your children’s best possible inheritance. 5. Feasts and Fasts Both feasting and fasting are great ways to commemorate the Lord’s work. Feasting celebrates the Lord’s grace and generosity toward you. Traditionally fasting for a season can help your family remember that God is all they need. You can mark what God is doing through abundance or with deprivation, as long as the focus is on your praiseworthy God. 6. Monuments and Memorials In Scripture the people of God often erected monuments to remind them of all the Lord had done. If an heirloom is a memento that can go with you anywhere, a monument is more like something built and left in a place that is significant, similar to the way we use a gravestone as a memorial of someone’s life. A tree planted at a family home, a family name carved in the wet cement of a sidewalk, a special brick or cornerstone laid into the wall of a new house, a word or phrase carved into the trunk of a tree—these are all examples of physical monuments that can be used in teaching your children something about God in ways they can literally look back at and remember. You might want to make a family time capsule. Fill something with precious letters or mementos and open it one day on a memorable date for your family. 7. Responsibility and Authority After your children reach a milestone spiritually or physically, you might consider how to give them new responsibilities. This could be coming to the main worship service with mom and dad, getting a driver’s license, getting a job, taking Communion, reaching a savings goal, cooking for themselves, doing laundry or yard work, paying a family bill, serving in ministry, and so on. Responsibilities communicate trust and teach accountability. Handing off responsibility to your children can be a great way to entrust them with authority. 8. Symbols and Crests Christianity is a faith bursting with symbols, including the ichthus, the dove, the alpha and omega, the Trinity knot, and, of course, the cross. Symbols are packed with meaning and memory, and so they make powerful additions to family discipleship milestones. For hundreds of years, some families have incorporated a family crest, something like a trademark symbol for their family. Creating or implementing a symbol unique to your family can be a creative way of crystalizing your family’s legacy and priorities. 9. Journeys and Destinations A pilgrimage is a journey with a religious purpose. Touring the geography of the Bible in Israel is a fantastic pilgrimage, but you don’t have to go far from home to take an important family trip. Journeys make great family discipleship milestones as they are adventures fraught with teachable moments and predisposed to making life-long memories. The journey can make the destination special; how you get there is as important as where you are going. Take a train, boat, bike, or a simple road trip for travel’s sake, and make the journey special. You know what would truly delight your family and be spiritually significant so use what you know about your children to creatively design a milestone journey. You might plan a wilderness adventure full of camping, canoeing, fishing, hunting, and hiking. Or it might better suit your family to journey to a special location—a mountain, the beach, another country, or a theme park. You might also consider journeys that are not as inward focused. Doing a short-term mission trip together as a family can be a profound experience.

    "text": "Una rata se convirtió en la inesperada protagonista de una comparecencia del alcalde de Buenos Aires, el centroderechista Jorge Macri, durante una visita a un mercadillo ilegal este jueves en pleno barrio porteño de Retiro. Mientras el jefe del Gobierno de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires ofrecía unas declaraciones a la prensa en medio del operativo de seguridad contra una feria ilegal, situada junto a uno de los barrios más empobrecidos de la capital, una rata corrió entre los pies de los presentes, generando un momento de alteración.

El alcalde, primo del expresidente de Argentina Mauricio Macri (2015-2019), retomó la charla con los periodistas con la frase- “Ordenemos lo que desordenó la rata». “Hemos logrado hacer todo este operativo sin violencia, sin que nadie esté lastimado, salvo el episodio pobre de los periodistas que se pegaron un susto con la rata esta que apareció ahí en el medio. Pero que, en sí mismo, es una metáfora de las cosas que estos lugares también generan, que es una degradación, un aceptar convivir con las cosas que están mal”, explicó. En la cercanía de la estación de autobuses de Retiro, uno de los lugares más transitados de la capital argentina, funcionaba, según denunciaron las autoridades, una feria de venta ilegal de artículos de procedencia desconocida. Ese mercadillo, en la que se habían identificado numerosos objetos robados, estaba situado en la entrada del Barrio Padre Carlos Mugica, más conocido como Barrio 31, la villa miseria (barrio de infraviviendas) más extendida de la capital.",

[Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Updated: 29-12-2023 05:21 IST | Created: 29-12-2023 05:21 IST Following is a summary of current world news briefs. France, Germany, UK and US condemn Iran's increase in uranium enrichment France, Germany, Britain and the United States on Thursday condemned an increase by Iran in the production rate of highly enriched uranium of up to 60% purity, close to the level used for nuclear weapons fuel. In a joint statement, the allies made no mention of any consequences Iran could face for the production hike but called for its reversal and said they remained \"committed to a diplomatic solution\" of the feud over Tehran's nuclear program. Former Hong Kong independence group leader seeks asylum in Britain The former leader of a Hong Kong pro-independence group, who was sentenced under a national security law imposed by China, fled to Britain and will seek asylum over there, he told the Washington Post. WHY IT IS IMPORTANT Venezuela's Maduro slams deployment of British warship to Guyana Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Thursday said the deployment of a British warship to waters off the coast of Guyana breaches the \"spirit\" of an agreement reached between Venezuelan and Guyanese authorities. Guyana and Venezuela agreed earlier this month to avoid the use of force and avoid increasing tensions in the long border dispute over the oil-rich Essequibo territory. Israeli tanks, missiles strike Gaza in offensive against Hamas Israeli forces attacked areas of the central and southern Gaza Strip where residents have been expecting a renewed ground offensive in areas crammed with tens of thousands of Palestinians already displaced by the Israeli-Hamas war. With nightfall on Thursday, an Israeli airstrike on a house in the southern city of Khan Younis killed eight Palestinians, health officials said. Three Palestinians were killed and six injured in an Israeli missile strike on a house in Maghazi camp in central Gaza, the Palestine Red Crescent said. Israeli troops killed hostages, mistaking their cries for help as ambush -military Israeli troops killed three Israeli hostages in Gaza on Dec. 15 when it mistook their cries for help as a ruse by Hamas militants to draw them into an ambush, the military said on Thursday, concluding that the soldiers acted rightly to the best of their understanding. On Dec. 15, the military immediately took responsibility for killing the three hostages, who were abducted by militants during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on towns in southern Israel. They were among 240 people taken hostage by the Palestinian group. Biden says American Judith Weinstein was killed by Hamas on Oct. 7 American Judith Weinstein, who was believed to have been kidnapped by Hamas, was killed by the Palestinian Islamist group on Oct. 7 when it attacked Israel, President Joe Biden said on Thursday, adding he was devastated by the news. Weinstein, 70, was also an Israeli and the last missing Canadian from the Oct. 7 attack. Last week Biden said her husband, Gadi Haggai, 73, was killed on Oct. 7. US, Mexico to keep border crossings open, Lopez Obrador says Mexican and U.S. officials agreed to keep border crossings open, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Thursday, after several key rail crossings were temporarily shuttered due to high numbers of migrants arriving at the countries' shared border. Brazil's Haddad unveils set of tax tweaks to ensure balanced public accounts Brazil's Finance Minister Fernando Haddad unveiled on Thursday tax adjustments to limit benefits across various sectors and ensure fiscal compensation, which are expected to face opposition in Congress. The package aims to completely replace the text of an approved bill that President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva vetoed, just to have it overturned by Congress two weeks ago. Congo rules out election re-run as observers flag irregularities The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on Thursday refused opposition calls for a re-run of disputed elections, as the main observer mission reported \"numerous irregularities\" that could undermine some results. Provisional results issued so far from the Dec. 20 general election show President Felix Tshisekedi with a commanding lead, but his opponents have demanded they be annulled, citing widespread issues with the roll-out and tabulation of the vote. Ukraine's Zelenskiy says he discussed peace formula with Pope Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he discussed Ukraine's peace formula in a call with Pope Francis on Thursday. \"We discussed our joint work to put Ukraine's Peace Formula into action,\" Zelenskiy said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.

    "text": "[Stop with the salt](https://www.sciencealert.com/people-are-adding-salt-to-their-morning-coffee-for-a-rather-bizarre-reason): adding a dash of water to [coffee](https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up) beans before grinding them could be the secret to a better-tasting cup of caffeinated goodness, new research suggests. The trick boils down to reducing the amount of [static electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_electricity) generated by grinding whole coffee beans, which otherwise causes them to clump together and clog up the grinder, creating a whole lot of mess and [waste](https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-amazing-practical-use-for-leftover-coffee-grounds). Coffee buffs have long been spritzing their beans to moisten them before grinding. Now scientists have confirmed what makes sparks fly in ground coffee beans – and shown how budding baristas can reduce that static electricity to consistently produce a more intense cup of espresso, if that's your thing. \"Moisture, whether it's residual moisture inside the roasted coffee or external moisture added during grinding, is what dictates the amount of charge that is formed during grinding,\" [says](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/12/231206115853.htm) Christopher Hendon, a materials chemist at the University of Oregon. Hendon, who has previously shown how [freezing coffee beans](https://www.sciencealert.com/want-to-drink-better-tasting-coffee-freeze-your-beans-say-scientists) improves the flavor, collaborated with former University of Oregon volcanologist Joshua Méndez Harper (now at Portland State University) to investigate which types of coffee tend to clump together and why, and how this impacts brewing. Harper, Hendon, and colleagues compared a bunch of commercially sourced and lab-roasted coffee beans, which varied in their origin, roasting times, and moisture content. They measured the static electricity in each batch after grinding, as well as the particle size of the freshly ground coffee and the flavor of the final brew. Grinding whole coffee beans into fine particles creates a lot of friction as particles rub against each other and fracture. This generates static electricity – a separation of charged particles – much the same as dust particles in volcanic plumes [rub together and discharge](https://www.sciencealert.com/high-speed-footage-finally-reveals-the-cause-of-volcanic-lightning) to produce [lightning](https://www.sciencealert.com/lightning). By twice-grinding coffee beans, the researchers showed that most of the static electricity in ground coffee arises from fracturing beans, and less so the friction between them. As for the types of beans that tend to clump together when ground, drier, darker roasts used in the team's experiments produced more electrostatic charges than lighter roasts, with a charge-to-mass ratio similar to particles in volcanic plumes and thunderclouds. The researchers suspect this may be because darker roasts are more brittle than lightly roasted beans that retain their moisture. By comparing beans ground with and without a spritz of extra water, Harper and colleagues also showed that adding water before grinding resulted in a longer espresso extraction time and a consistently stronger brew. The water permeated through moistened coffee grounds and pulled more flavor from the less clumpy beans. Speaking to New Scientist, Hendon [recommends](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2406880-why-adding-water-when-you-grind-coffee-beans-makes-for-a-better-brew/) adding around 20 microliters of water per gram of coffee, or about half a milliliter for a typical espresso shot, to improve its consistency and flavor. While further experiments are needed to test different types of grinders and brewing methods, the researchers [conclude](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matt.2023.11.005) that \"a few simple squirts of water have solved the problems of clumping, channeling, and poor extractions while aiding in the pursuit of attaining the tastiest espresso.\" They also hope their coffee-fueled collaboration yields new insights about earth science as well. \"There's a lot more to know about how coffee breaks, how it flows as particles, and how it interacts with water,\" [says](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/12/231206115853.htm) Harper, the volcanologist who led the study. \"These investigations may help resolve parallel issues in geophysics – whether it's landslides, volcanic eruptions, or how water percolates through soil.\" The study has been published in [Matter](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matt.2023.11.005).",

    "text": "AIFA AIFA es reconocido como uno de los más bellos del mundo El Aeropuerto Internacional Felipe Ángeles fue seleccionado por el premio Prix Versailles.CIUDAD DE MÉXICO (apro).- El Aeropuerto Internacional Felipe Ángeles (AIFA) fue seleccionado por el premio Prix Versailles como uno de los logros de arquitectura y diseño más bellos del mundo y la presidenta Claudia Sheinbaum presumió la nominación. Este reconocimiento del aeropuerto mexicano, construido en el gobierno anterior, lo ubica a la par de aeropuertos en Abu Dhabi, Singapur, Bangkok, Boston y Kansas City. El premio Prix Versailles es considerado el más alto galardón a nivel mundial en arquitectura y diseño en obras contemporáneas. El AIFA es un complejo que ofrece incluso servicio de hotel y tiene el museo del Mamut, oficinas administrativas, una terminal de carga y aduanas, terminal de helicóptero, otra de combustibles, centro de convenciones, corredor cultural y la exhacienda de Santa Lucía. La terminal de pasajeros es de 384,000 m2 de construcción y un total de 45 posiciones (28 de contacto, 12 remotas y 5 de plataforma abierta). La página oficial del AIFA indica que “su diseño modular permite que el edificio pueda ampliarse y dar servicio a más pasajeros en el futuro”. La terminal se encuentra edificada sobre 1,318 aisladores sísmicos para que en caso de un movimiento de gran magnitud se pueda operar de manera inmediata. “La zona comercial tiene una superficie de 26,750 m2 y es una reminiscencia de un“Pueblo Mágico” de tal forma que su arquitectura captura los atributos simbólicos de cada rincón del país, para compartir con los pasajeros la esencia del territorio mexicano”, se especifica. También está la Base Aérea Militar No. 1 en Santa Lucía que también es parte del proyecto del AIFA, que, por lo tanto, mantiene operaciones civiles y militares. “Esta base es la más grande en México con un total de 3,741 hectáreas y sus diferentes instalaciones”, entre pista militar, plataforma y filmación; torre de control de tráfico aéreo; centro especializado de entrenamiento, hangares de recogida, escuadrones de vigilancia aérea, terminal aérea militar, estación meteorológica, servicios de salvamento y bomberos (S.S.E.I.), así como instalaciones administrativas y deportivas.",

    "text": "<p>New York, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 26th Apr, 2024) New York's highest court on Thursday overturned disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein's 2020 conviction on sex crime charges, a shock reversal in one of the defining cases of the #MeToo movement.</p><p> In its 4-3 decision, the Court of Appeals found the trial judge had erred in admitting the testimony of additional women who were allegedly abused by Weinstein but who were not named in the charges brought against him, and ordered a new trial.</p><p> The ruling does not affect a separate 16-year rape sentence handed down in California -- meaning the once-untouchable Hollywood heavyweight will remain behind bars.</p><p> \"The accused has a right to be held to account only for the crime charged and, thus, allegations of prior bad acts may not be admitted against them for the sole purpose of establishing their propensity for criminality,\" Judge Jenny Rivera wrote in an opinion for the majority.</p><p> Bombshell allegations broke against the Academy Award winning producer in 2017, launching the #MeToo movement that paved the way for women to fight back against sexual violence in the workplace.</p><p> Weinstein, 72, had been convicted in a New York court in 2020 of the rape and sexual assault of ex-actress Jessica Mann in 2013, and of forcibly performing oral sex on former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006. He was later sentenced to 23 years in prison.</p><p> He found out Thursday's news while in prison, his lawyer said, after being handed a slip of paper that \"just said 'Harvey Weinstein conviction reversed.'\" </p><p> \"He called me actually three times,\" Arthur Aidala, head of Weinstein's legal team, told reporters. \"He said thank you more times than I can count.\"</p><p> \"We knew that Harvey Weinstein did not get a fair trial,\" Aidala added.</p><p> The Silence Breakers, a group of women who banded together to report Weinstein's misconduct, called the decision \"disheartening,\" adding \"this ruling does not diminish the validity of our experiences or our truth.\"</p><p> Manhattan prosecutors said they plan to retry the case.</p><p> - Dozens of accusers -</p><p> Weinstein was also convicted by a Los Angeles court -- and sentenced to an additional 16 years in prison -- for the rape of a woman in a Beverly Hills hotel room.</p><p> With the New York conviction overturned, he is set to be transferred to a California prison, though it was not immediately clear which one or when.</p><p> \"The legal system has never served survivors in this country,\" #MeToo founder Tarana Burke told reporters.</p><p> \"Because these brave women in this case broke their silence, millions and millions and millions of others found the strength to come forward,\" she added.</p><p> \"That will always be the victory.\"</p><p> Following his conviction in New York, a civil trial awarded $17 million to dozens of other women who had accused the former movie magnate of abuse.</p><p> - 'Psychological trauma' -</p><p> \"With today's decision, this Court continues to thwart the steady gains survivors of sexual violence have fought for in our criminal justice system,\" Judge Madeline Singas, who dissented against the ruling, said.</p><p> \"Forgotten are the women who bear the psychological trauma of sexual violence and the scars of testifying again, and again.\"</p><p> The decision rested on the fact the trial judge allowed prosecutors to rely on so-called \"Molineux witnesses,\" who were allowed to testify despite not being part of the charges -- an exception to the normal rules surrounding evidence.</p><p> Attorney Douglas Wigdor, who represented two such witnesses, said: \"The jury was instructed on the relevance of this testimony, and overturning the verdict is tragic in that it will require the victims to endure yet another trial.\"</p><p> Weinstein and his brother Bob co-founded Miramax Films, a distribution company named after their mother Miriam and father Max, in 1979. It was sold to Disney in 1993.</p><p> Their hits included 1998's \"Shakespeare in Love,\" for which Weinstein shared a best picture Oscar. Over the years, Weinstein's films received more than 300 Oscar nominations and 81 statuettes.</p>",

    "title": "Hopes of Gaza ceasefire rise as Hamas delegation arrives in Cairo",
    "text": "Smoke billows on the horizon as a residential building is hit in an Israeli airstrike in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on Thursday. Photograph: Ismael Mohamad/UPI/Rex/Shutterstock\nHopes of a ceasefire in Gaza rose on Saturday as a Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo to continue indirect talks, with what is believed to be a response to a new proposal, reportedly agreed by Israel, to halt fighting for an initial 40 days and exchange hostages for Palestinian prisoners.\nEgyptian and US mediators have reported signs of compromise in recent days and Egyptian state news channel Al-Qahera said on Saturday that a consensus had been reached in the indirect talks over many of the disputed points but gave no further details.\nHowever, many analysts remain pessimistic after five months of stop-start talks that have frequently broken down. Negotiators have consistently struggled to reconcile Hamas’s demand for a lasting ceasefire which would allow the organisation to claim a victory with the apparent determination of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, to force Hamas from power, kill or capture its leadership and destroy all its military capabilities.\nA senior Israeli official, speaking on Saturday on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing negotiations, played down the prospects for a full end to the war. The official said Israel was committed to an offensive on Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city, and that it would not agree in any circumstance to end the war as part of a hostage-release deal.\nEgyptian sources told the Wall Street Journal that Israel would give the truce talks another week, after which it would launch its long-threatened offensive.\nThe US has sought to pressure Hamas to accept the latest proposals, which are widely seen as a last chance to avert intense new fighting. Any Israeli offensive in Rafah is likely to bring many new civilian casualties and exacerbate the acute humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\n“The only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a ceasefire is Hamas,” the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Friday.\nBlinken also reiterated Washington’s objections to a Rafah offensive, saying Israel had not presented a credible plan to protect the 1.2 million or more civilians displaced from elsewhere in Gaza who have sought refuge in sprawling, tented refugee camps and UN shelters there.\n“Absent such a plan, we can’t support a major military operation going into Rafah because the damage it would do is beyond what’s acceptable,” he said.\nHumanitarian groups and the United Nations have also repeatedly called on Israel to call off a Rafah attack.\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, warned on Friday that a full-scale military operation in Rafah “could lead to a bloodbath, and further weaken an already broken health system”.\nIsraeli officials say a Rafah ground offensive is essential to achieve Israel’s stated war aims because thousands of Hamas fighters and the militant Islamist organisation’s leaders are based there.\nHamas seized about 250 hostages during the surprise attack into southern Israel in October last year that triggered the war. About half are still held in Gaza, with many thought to be in or under Rafah.\nAbout 1,200 died in the October Hamas attack, mostly civilians. More than 34,600 have died in Gaza, mostly women and children, in the ensuing Israeli military offensive. Israel says Hamas is using civilians as human shields, a charge the organisation denies.\nIsraeli strikes early on Saturday on Gaza killed at least six people. Three bodies were recovered from the rubble of a building in Rafah and taken to Yousef al-Najjar hospital. A strike in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza also killed three people, according to hospital officials.\nIn the last 24 hours, the bodies of 32 people killed by Israeli strikes have been brought to local hospitals, Gaza’s health ministry said on Saturday. The ministry does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its tallies.\nHamas, which has been in power in the Gaza Strip since 2007, says it is considering the latest truce proposal with a “positive spirit”.\nBut the group is deeply divided, and statements made by its political wing, now mainly based in Istanbul, often do not reflect the views of Yahya Sinwar, the organiser of the October attacks and most senior Hamas leader in Gaza.\nObservers say that it is significant that the Hamas delegation now in Cairo is led by Khalil al-Hayya, deputy head of the group’s political arm in Gaza, rather than a more senior figure who might lack credibility with Sinwar, who has ultimate authority over any deal.\nThe Israeli government is also deeply divided. Senior members of its war cabinet are keen to secure a ceasefire and free surviving prisoners but far-right ministers have threatened to bring down Netanyahu’s ruling coalition if the war is not continued with greater force.\nThe United States, along with Egypt and Qatar, has been trying to seal a ceasefire deal in the nearly seven-month-old war.\nDuring the last truce, over one week in November, 80 Israeli hostages were exchanged for 240 Palestinian prisoners. Up to a third of those remaining in Hamas captivity are now thought to be dead.\nIsrael’s siege has pushed many of Gaza’s 2.4 million people to the brink of famine.\nUS pressure has prompted Israel to facilitate more aid deliveries to Gaza, including through the reopened Erez crossing that leads directly into the hardest-hit north.\nLast week, Israeli settlers blocked a convoy using a new route from Jordan before it crossed into Gaza. Once inside the territory, the convoy was commandeered by Hamas militants, before UN officials reclaimed it.\nFood availability has improved “a little bit”, according to the UN and residents in Rafah interviewed by the Guardian, with prices for some basics dropping to near prewar levels in southern areas where there is most aid.\nThe US-based charity World Central Kitchen resumed operations this week, after suspending them in the aftermath of Israeli drone strikes that killed seven of its staff as they unloaded aid in Gaza on 1 April.\nWorld Central Kitchen was involved in an effort earlier this year to establish a new maritime aid corridor to Gaza from Cyprus to help compensate for dwindling deliveries by land from Israel.\nThe project suffered a further setback on Friday when the US military announced high winds had forced troops working to assemble a temporary aid pier off the Gaza coast to relocate to the Israeli port of Ashdod.",

    "title": "Kim Jong UN bans Christmas, but activists send gifts of Bibles, food and messages of hope – DNyuz",
    "text": "Christmas is banned in North Korea , but that is not stopping a group of activists from sending messages of hope, faith and freedom to the people suffering under the dictatorship of Kim Jong Un.\nFlash drives celebrating the holiday, and including Bible readings, were launched into the Yellow Sea in bottles so that the currents will carry them to the shores of the North Korean peninsula.\n“We should be doing everything we can to get information into North Korea by land, by sea and by air,” says Suzanne Scholte, chair of the Washington, D.C.-based North Korean Freedom Coalition which sponsored the messages. The operation is part of the group’s “Operation Truth,” which Scholte says, “is modeled after the Berlin Airlift, to get critical help to the starving people of North Korea.”\nScholte’s Christmas message that is included in the bottles says in part, “Christmas, which is celebrated all over the world on December 25th, marks the day when Jesus was born…Many of your ancestors also believed in Jesus. IN fact, in 1907, in Pyongyang, there were so many Christians who believed in Jesus that Pyongyang became known as a Holy City. But when Kim II Sung came to power, he wanted North Koreans to worship him as a god, and not the one true God. So, he killed many Christian leaders, sent others to political prison camps, or banished them. He did all he could to kill the followers of Jesus Christ…”\nThe flash drives also contain North Korean music, changing the lyrics from worshiping Kim Jong Un to worshiping God. They also play K-Pop songs, the Books of Matthew and Mark, as well as recorded messages from several members of Congress touting freedom for the North Korean people. Among those who recorded messages were Senators Jim Risch and Tim Kaine, as well as Congressmen Michael McCaul and Gregory Meeks.\nThe North Korean Freedom Coalition started the outreach in 2022. It also has sent 600 shortwave radios with ear buds into the kingdom. During the summer, they started a program for Americans to order items that could be delivered to North Korea.\nScholte said that an increasing number of North Koreans are learning about the outside world because of the efforts of her group.\n“We must communicate to the people in power in Pyongyang that they have friends and allies in Korea and America, who have only one desire for them: to share with the benefits of a free people, to give them a life of home instead of despair,” she said.\n“Those in leadership positions in the DPRK regime wake up in the morning with only two choices in their lives: being slaves devoted to Kim Jong Un or death and their families’ deaths. That is why so many began escaping -not just for food, but for freedom, for a better life.”\nScholte’s group and the Defense Forum Foundation also help operate Free North Korea Radio, a station that broadcasts news and information into North Korea. Its director, Kim Song Min, escaped in 1997, and despite attempts by the dictatorship to jam its programming, the station has broadcast on shortwave and on the internet.\n“I would like to express my gratitude to the Americans for standing with us to help us reach the people of North Korea with the truth about America and South Korea,” he said.\n“North Koreans are brainwashed from childhood to hate Americans as their enemy and believe that America occupies South Korea, making them live in misery while North Korea prospers as a paradise under the Kim dictatorship.”\nThere is another message that the activists are delivering to the North Korean people, one bottle at a time.\nScholte said that message is what Americans cherish. “The benefits of a free people, a life of hope instead of despair.”\nFox News’ Emily Robertson contributed to this report.\nThe post Kim Jong UN bans Christmas, but activists send gifts of Bibles, food and messages of hope appeared first on Fox News .",
