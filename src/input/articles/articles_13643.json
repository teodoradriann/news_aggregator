    "title": "Drive to plant 3 crore saplings to begin soon: CM Mann - Hindustan Times",
    "text": "Chief minister Bhagwant Mann on Thursday said it was the need of the hour to enhance the forest cover in the state. Chairing a meeting to review the forestation drive in the state here at his office, Mann said the state government has set a target of planting around 3 crore saplings for which a massive drive will be started in the coming days. Mann said farmers can play a proactive role for transforming this campaign into a public movement, adding that as the food growers have made the country self-reliant in food production, they can play a major role in enhancing the green cover. The CM said 1.2 crore saplings were planted last year. He asked the deputy commissioners to identify vacant government land in their respective districts for ensuring massive plantation. The CM said the DCs should personally monitor the plantation drive at the ground level. He said there were 14.01 lakh tube wells, adding that if every farmer plants four saplings then the forest cover will be enhanced considerably.",

    "text": "Ukraine’s advances in Kursk region jeopardize Putin's legitimacy - Canadian expert That’s according to Andres Kazekamp, a professor at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, who spoke on CBC Radio. Putin likely feels that his own regime and legitimacy are in jeopardy, the scholar believes. As the Russian president portrays himself as the defender of his people and the Russian Empire as such, the way the Ukrainians humiliate him naturally puts pressure on him, the expert adds. [Ukraine’s high-precision airstrike hits Russian stronghold in Kursk region](/rubric-ato/3897827-ukraines-highprecision-airstrike-hits-russian-stronghold-in-kursk-region.html) He noted that Putin tends to avoid publicity when things don't go his way. During the first few days of the Ukrainian raid, Putin was nowhere to be seen in public as he had no answers to offer. In general, he was caught off guard, Kazekamp said. The expert believes the only way to peace is through Ukraine's victory on the battlefield. [Kremlin launched information campaign to diminish losses in Kursk region - ISW](/rubric-ato/3897565-kremlin-launched-information-campaign-to-diminish-losses-in-kursk-region-isw.html) The ongoing war is not about the territory, he stressed, as the Russians seek complete domination over Ukraine. As Ukrinform reported earlier, Ukraine’s Defense Forces are pursuing an offensive in Russia’s Kursk region, having already gained control of over 1,000 square kilometers and more than 80 settlements.

    "title": "Kathleen Wilson's Minnesota dentist did 30 procedures at once: lawsuit",
    "text": "A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and Molldrem Family Dentistry caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote Dr. Avrum Goldstein, a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at NOVA Southeastern University , also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says. The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",
