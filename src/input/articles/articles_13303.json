    "text": "\\nWe\\u2019ve all had those moments where we\\u2019ve yelled at our technology, right? Sure, it\\u2019s supposed to make life so much easier, but it can be very frustrating when these smart devices can\\u2019t figure out what the heck we\\u2019re talking about. It should be so simple just to tell Siri, Alexa, and their friends what to do, yet sometimes they just don\\u2019t get it. We are not alone. Even C\\xe9line Dion can\\u2019t get Siri to do what she wants. She posted a hilarious video on Instagram of an all too familiar occurrence, making us feel a bit better about ourselves.\n\\n \\n\\n \\n Siri Didn\\u2019t Want To Do What C\\xe9line Dion Wanted Her To \\n \\n \\nThe six-time Grammy winner asked Siri to play her version Hymne \\xe0 l\\u2019amour . It seems Siri didn\\u2019t\\u2019 quite understand C\\xe9line\\u2019s request and played another of her famous hits.\n\\n \\n \\nShe said, \\u201cHey Siri, play Hymne \\xe0 l\\u2019amour by C\\xe9line Dion?,\\u2019 \\u201d\n\\n \\n \\nHer phone responded, \\u201cI cannot find that track by C\\xe9line Dion but here is My Heart Will Go On .\\u201d\n\\n \\n \\n\\u201cNo! Hello,\\u201d a frustrated C\\xe9line said. \\u201cNo, no, no.\\u201d\n\\n \\n \\nShe asked a second time and once again, Siri played My Heart Will Go On .\n\\n \\n \\nC\\xe9line decided to give it one more shot and made her request in her most elegant French accent. This time, Siri got it right.\n\\n \\n \\n\\u201cThird time\\u2019s a charm,\\u201d she captioned the video.\n\\n \\n \\nA fan wrote, \\u201cBut Siri knows that C\\xe9line Dion is the greatest and most beautiful singer of all time!\\u201d\n\\n \\n \\nThis fan agreed, \\u201cOmg I love you so much.\\u201d\n\\n \\n \\nThis one noticed that Siri didn\\u2019t quite do C\\xe9line\\u2019s accent justice. \\u201cAnd yet Siri\\u2019s final response was barely French.\\u201d\n\\n \\n \\nC\\xe9line, thank you for sharing your blunder and helping us remember we aren\\u2019t alone.\n\\n \\n \\n You can find the source of this story\\u2019s featured image here .\n\\n \\n",

    "text": "The country has been hit by a blast of cold weather, with temperatures falling as low as minus 5C overnight amid forecasts of snow and freezing rain. Alerts were issued on Thursday and will run until January 8, meaning a rise in deaths, particularly among those aged 65 and over or with health conditions, is likely, the UKHSA said. Meteorologists had warned that temperatures overnight could have plummeted to as low as minus 8C as a week-long spell of wintry conditions hit the UK.Initial data indicated that Rostherne in Cheshire and in Yeovilton in Somerset dropped to minus 5C overnight.In Scotland , Eskdalemuir in Dumfries and Galloway felt the same chilly temperatures, hitting minus 5C at 11pm on Thursday.UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) cold weather health alerts for all of England remain in place ahead of a week of low temperatures.Dan Stroud, a meteorologist at the Met Office , said conditions should become warmer by the end of this weekend before cold weather strikes again early next week.He said: “The second half of the weekend should be in the high singles or low doubles (for temperature figures).“But temperatures will dive again next week, particularly on Monday and Tuesday.“They should start to improve towards the latter end of the week. But there’s a lot of water to go under the bridge until then.”Met Office warnings are in place for snow and ice on Friday across parts of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and northern England.A yellow warning about heavy snow and freezing rain is in place from noon on Saturday until 9am on Monday and covers most of England and Wales.Met Office meteorologist Tom Morgan said: “At the moment we’ve issued a very large snow warning for Saturday until Monday but it doesn’t mean that everywhere within that warning could see snow, it’s just a heads-up there could be some impacts.”The Met Office has warned people to be prepared and aware when travelling, with longer journey times likely.Railways are likely to experience delays or cancellations, with National Rail confirming that various routes across England, Scotland and Wales are impacted.St Thomas Becket church is surrounded by frosty fields on the Romney Marsh in KentSt Thomas Becket church is surrounded by frosty fields on the Romney Marsh in Kent",

    "title": "BJP using Ram temple event for political purposes: Muslim League",
    "text": "Malappuram: The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), a key ally of the Congress-led UDF in Kerala, accused the BJP on Friday of exploiting the consecration ceremony of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya for political purposes. The IUML expressed hope that secular forces would recognise this political manoeuvre of the BJP. Amid increasing uncertainty in the Congress’s Kerala state unit on the political stance the party should take regarding the invitation to its national leadership for the Ram Temple consecration ceremony on January 22, the IUML urged the Congress to take an independent decision. “The BJP is treating it as a political inauguration for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. The prime minister and others have launched a political propaganda aimed at the next parliamentary election,” IUML National General Secretary P K Kunhalikutty told reporters after the party’s political affairs committee meeting. Alleging that the saffron party is politicising the event by differentiating between those who participate in it and those who don’t, Kunhalikutty said, “The BJP government’s target is the next parliamentary elections. The League highly respects the faith and freedom of worship of the Hindu community. No comment on that. But the opening of the Ram temple is being used politically.” He said the issue is political, not religious, and called on every political party, especially those with secular views, to realise this and take independent decisions. On the Congress’s stand, Kunhalikutty said, “Congress has its own set up, leadership. They are facing a lot of problems. Let them take an independent decision.” IUML supremo Sadiq Ali Shihab Thangal added that the IUML supports the faithful on the issue but cannot accept the attempt to turn it into a political agenda for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. The IUML’s statement is seen as an attempt to exert pressure on the Congress’s state unit, which is in a difficult position regarding the invitation extended to its national leaders for the consecration ceremony next month. The ruling CPI(M) in the state has already declared that its representatives will not attend the ceremony, considering it a political move by the BJP ahead of the general elections that are to be held in a few months.",

    "text": "CBC Former pastor of Ontario megachurch faces 2 more sexual assault charges, police say Read full article CBC December 29, 2023 at 11:00 a.m. · 5 min read Bruxy Cavey was the primary teaching pastor at The Meeting House church and worked there from 1996 to 2021, according to Hamilton police. (Bruxy Cavey/Facebook - image credit)\nThe former pastor of The Meeting House — an Ontario megachurch — is facing two more sexual assault charges, CBC Hamilton has learned.\nHamilton police Const. Krista-Lee Ernst told CBC Hamilton Bruxy Cavey was charged with two counts of sexual assault on Dec. 22.\nErnst didn't say what prompted the new charges or provide detail about when the alleged assaults took place, but wrote in an email that Cavey will appear in court in January.\nCavey, who was the primary teaching pastor at The Meeting House and worked there from 1996 to 2021, was charged with sexual assault in June 2022. He was 57 when he was first charged.\nThe Meeting House church is headquartered in Oakville, Ont., but has locations throughout the province. It also streams its Sunday service at several cinemas in southern Ontario.\nCBC Hamilton contacted Cavey and the church for comment but didn't immediately receive a response. Cavey's lawyer, Megan Savard, replied by email on Thursday.\n\"It is unfortunate that a new and unrelated allegation has surfaced on the eve of Mr. Cavey's trial,\" Savard said.\n\"Mr. Cavey maintains his innocence and will vigorously defend against the new charges in court. In the meantime, he remains focused on and committed to clearing his name at his upcoming trial.\"\nChurch investigation found 'abuse of power'\nA victim's advocate for the church's patrons previously said there were 38 allegations of sexual misconduct against a group of four former pastors, including Cavey. The Meeting House didn't previously provide an updated number and the advocate, Melodie Bissell, no longer works with the church, she told CBC Hamilton by phone this week.\nBack in 2022, when Cavey was initially charged, police said the allegation was reported in April of that year and the alleged sexual assault occurred in Hamilton. Cavey was arrested but released then with some conditions.\nStory continues Neither police nor the church confirmed at that time which location or locations Cavey has worked at over the years.\nThe Meeting House didn't comment as the matter was before the courts, but was providing updates to the church community on its website.\nIn March 2022, the church and members of its \"overseers board\" posted online, saying it found Cavey had a sexual relationship with a woman that contravened church policies.\nA victims advocate at The Meeting House, a megachurch in Oakville, Ont., has received 38 allegations of sexual misconduct against a group of four former pastors including a Hamilton man. The Meeting House is a megachurch based in Oakville, Ont. The Hartford Institute for Religious Research in the U.S. defines a megachurch as \"any Protestant Christian congregation with a sustained average weekly attendance of 2,000 persons or more in its worship services, counting all adults and children at all its worship locations.\" (Google Maps)\nFormer board chair Maggie John said the relationship went on for an \"extended period of time ... constituted an abuse of Bruxy's power and authority as a member of the clergy, and amounted to sexual harassment.\"\nCavey was reportedly 46 during the relationship and the accuser was 23, according to board member Jennifer Hryniw.\nJohn said Cavey resigned at the church's request on March 3 and lost his pastoral credentials days later with the church's denomination, Be In Christ Church of Canada.\nHamilton police previously said it could not comment on the church's investigation.\nCavey apologized for 'affair' in blog post\nCavey made a blog post on his website titled My Confession on March 8, 2022, related to the church's investigation. The website and the post are no longer accessible.\nIn the post, he said \"at the core of the allegations there is truth\" and he apologized for having an \"extramarital affair.\"\n\"I was also irresponsible in my role as a spiritual leader and Christian clergy, which involves dynamics of power and influence and an expectation of exemplary conduct that makes me doubly accountable. I accept this responsibility with deep regret for my actions,\" he wrote.\n\"I wish I had had the courage years ago to divulge what has now become publicly known through the bravery of the woman I was involved with. Although I had repented before God, I kept it a secret from others. I am sorry upon sorry for my cowardice.\"\nWhen asked about the blog post, police previously said it couldn't comment on it.\nChurch 'substantiated' claims of sexual abuse\nMonths later, in August 2022, Bruce Miller, co-chair of the board of overseers, said an investigation into allegations against Cavey \"substantiated\" two claims of \"sexual abuse by a church leader.\"\n\"In a third [claim], his actions have been found to be substantiated as sexual misconduct,\" Miller said, adding that in one case the alleged victim was underage.\nThe church defines sexual abuse by a leader as \"any sexualized behaviour that occurs within the church context and where one party has more power than the other.\" That can include people who are paid or volunteer in leadership positions like pastors, Christian counsellors, youth leaders, deacons or Sunday school teachers.\nThe church also said it substantiated allegations against another former senior pastor who hadn't been charged by police.\nJared Taylor, the church's former communications pastor, said at the time the allegation involving a minor was reported to police, though it's unclear if it was reported to police in Hamilton or Halton.\nHamilton police spokesperson Jackie Penman previously said the service's investigation into Cavey concluded and there weren't any additional charges. Halton police declined to comment.\nIt was unclear whether a new investigation led to the December 2023 charges and, if so, when that began.\nTRENDING 1.

    "text": "\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n See full bio \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Avinash Jaisrani \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n At Tech4Gamers, I contribute as a News Reporter, combining my skills and gaming enthusiasm to keep our audience updated on the latest developments.\n\\n \\n See full bio \\n Story Highlight \\n \\n A new leak has revealed Ubisoft\\u2019s aggressive monetization plans for Assassin\\u2019s Creed Shadows. \\n The gaming giant will offer outfits, weapon skins, and more through a seasonal battle pass system. \\n This monetization will be handled through the Assassin\\u2019s Creed Infinity hub, making for a Call of Duty-like system. \\n \\n \\nAssassin\\u2019s Creed Shadows is set to change things for Ubisoft\\u2019s biggest franchise in multiple ways. For starters, the title is marking a return to day-one Steam releases and will ship without a premium season pass or early access .\n\\nA battle pass will also be introduced with this entry, and more details on this subject have recently emerged through a datamine. According to this information, Assassin\\u2019s Creed Shadows will offer Call of Duty-like cosmetics for multiple seasons.\n\\n Why it matters: Gamers today are becoming increasingly tired of aggressive microtransactions and monetization . Moreover, the trend of battle passes is far from a fan-favorite.\n\\n View post on imgur.com\n\\n\n\\nAs per the datamine , Assassin\\u2019s Creed Shadows will debut its battle pass system with season 1. Dubbed Eye in the Dark, this season will offer character packs, weapon cosmetics, and skins for in-game mounts as shown above.\n\\nA few examples include the Kagutsuchi Shinobi Pack and the Sekiryu Mount. This content can be brought through Isu Coins, a currency earned by playing the game. Completing the battle pass will reward a total of 9,050 Isu Coins, though users can continue to rely on the previously purchasable Helix Credits.\n\\nA similar system already existed in Ubisoft\\u2019s previous Assassin\\u2019s Creed offerings, but the microtransactions appear to be more aggressive this time. As proof, the gaming giant is said to be partnering with companies like Red Bull for more appealing outfits.\n\\n View post on imgur.com\n\\n\n\\nOne screenshot from the leak also highlights Assassin\\u2019s Cred Infinity, a connecting hub that will serve as the link between all future entries in the series. All in all, this system sounds similar to what Activision is doing with Call of Duty .\n\\nThe cosmetics, in particular, are very reminiscent of Activision\\u2019s approach of bombarding users with in-game items that entice them to spend money on in-game purchases. Moreover, Call of Duty frequently collaborates with companies for crossovers.\n\\n\\nWhile it remains to be seen how big of a problem the microtransactions will be, concerns over Assassin\\u2019s Creed Shadows\\u2019 monetization are not new . As such, this datamine has only added to the frustration surrounding Ubiosft\\u2019s upcoming blockbuster.\n\\nWhat do you think about the monetization? Do you plan on buying Assassin\\u2019s Creed Shadows? Share your thoughts in the comments, and join the Tech4Gamers Forums for more discussions.\n\\n",

We have more newsletters\nShow Me No thanks, close See our Privacy Notice The Met Office has issued a thunderstorm warning across parts of the UK, including Exeter , North, Mid and East Devon - signalling the end of this week&apos;s warm and sunny weather . The severe weather alert is in place from noon to 10pm on Sunday, May 12 and warns of thunder and lightning, heavy rain and the possibility for flooded properties.\nAfter weeks of rain and lower-than-usual temperatures, many hoped the current wave of sunshine and warmth would last longer than a week. However, meteorologists say up to 50mm of rain could fall in just two hours on Sunday - but it is still predicted to be 23C.\nThe forecaster says: \"Heavy showers and thunderstorms could lead to some disruption in places, especially to travel. Isolated property flooding is possible.\"\nAccording to the Met Office, the storms will begin in the south and move north throughout the day. It adds: \"Heavy showers and thunderstorms are likely to break out in the south of this area late Sunday morning and early Sunday afternoon, moving steadily north while growing into larger areas of rain before clearing the area.\"\n\"Some intense downpours are possible in a few places, giving up to 30 mm in less than hour and perhaps 40-50 mm over two to three hours leading to surface water flooding. Hail, frequent lightning strikes and strong wind gusts will be additional localised hazards.\"\nDespite the forecasted heavy rain and storms, temperatures are predicted to remain high. Bristol is set to reach a balmy 23C on Sunday, with some parts of the UK potentially seeing highs of 26C.\nHowever, these soaring temperatures are expected to drop following the storm, returning to the more typical mid-high teens usually seen throughout May.\n⚠️ Want the latest Devon breaking news and top stories first?

    "text": "Israeli woman Mia Schem has said she lived through a ‘holocaust’ in her time being held hostage by\nHamas in her first interview since being freed.\nMia, 21, was among the young people snatched while partying at the Supernova music festival on October 7.\nShe spent 54 days trapped by her captors in\nGaza – during which she underwent surgery on an injured hand, a procedure her family said was carried out by a vet.\nRecalling the operation to Israel’s\n N12 News, Mia said she received ‘no anaesthetic, no nothing’ and was left ‘choking on [her] own tears’.\nShe told the interviewer the surgeon had threatened to send her down a tunnel.\nThe tattoo artist, who also holds French citizenship, became one of the most prominent faces of the hostage crisis in Gaza following the Hamas attacks that killed around 1,200.\nShe was the first hostage to appear in a video released by the group,\na 78-second clip that showed her receiving medical attention on her arm and asking to be returned home.\nMia was reunited with her mother Keren and brother Eli on November 30 following her release.\nHer aunt Vivian Hadar told media soon afterwards: ‘A vet operated on her arm.’\nFollow Metro on WhatsApp to be the first to get all the latest news\nWant to be the first to hear the world’s top stories?

Why are there children here, why is there a woman here?’\nMia was among 120 hostages released over the course of a week-long ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that took place last month, a group largely made up of women and people with dual nationalities.\nThe head of psychiatry at a Tel Aviv hospital where some of those released were taken said they present the worst cases of trauma she has come across in her career.\nRenena Eitan told\nthe Guardian: ‘I thought that I’d treated the most severe cases there were, but with these patients that came from captivity we couldn’t believe that degree of cruelty.\n‘Most of the hostages who came back went through very severe physical and mental abuse … We know that they have a long way ahead of them.’\nEarlier this week, around 86 people were killed when an airstrike launched by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) hit a refugee camp in the centre of Gaza.\nThe country’s military said it ‘regrets the harm’ caused by the strike, saying it was targeted at Hamas operatives.\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at .\nFor more stories like this,\ncheck our news page.\nSign Up for News Updates\nGet your need-to-know latest news, feel-good stories, analysis and more\nPrivacy Policyand Terms of Serviceapply.",

    "text": "The U.S. Supreme Court handed down several high-profile decisions Thursday morning. One case blocked a controversial bankruptcy deal involving the opioid crisis, another reinstated access to abortions for those facing medical emergencies in Idaho and a third blocked an EPA rule regulating air pollution from taking effect. John Yang reports on the significance of the rulings. Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Geoff Bennett: The U.S. Supreme Court handed down rulings in a number of high-profile cases this morning. Amna Nawaz: The justices ripped up a controversial bankruptcy deal, one that would have provided billions of dollars to states devastated by the opioid epidemic and shielded the family accused of pushing painkillers in search of profits. The justices also reinstated access to abortions for those facing medical emergencies in Idaho for now, and the court temporarily blocked a Biden environmental policy regulating air pollution from taking effect. To help unpack the details and significance of the rulings, we're joined first by John Yang, anchor of \"PBS News Weekend,\" who also covers the Supreme Court for us. It's good to see you again, John. So let's start with this abortion case, because the Supreme Court, as you well know, formally dismissed an appeal over Idaho's strict abortion ban. How did that ruling track with the case document that was mistakenly uploaded to the Supreme Court Website yesterday? John Yang: It was essentially what we got the sneak preview of yesterday, Geoff. The six — 6-3 majority, rather, said this case isn't ready to decide yet, so they're going to allow emergency care abortions in Idaho while the Idaho law is challenged. And to get that challenged, they're sending it back to the lower courts. Now, this also means that there are a lot of unanswered questions and there's no guidance for lower courts about how to deal with similar laws around the country. In Texas, for instance, an almost identical law is gone — has gone into effect with the blessing of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals over the Biden administration's objections. Now, here is Mary Ziegler. She's a law professor at U.C. Davis and she's written extensively on abortion. Mary Ziegler, University of California, Davis: The impact in the short term is going to be pretty limited. The court's ruling will have the effect of reinstating the injunction in the district court that allowed emergency abortions to continue in Idaho. It doesn't really have any impact on any of the other states with narrow abortion bans or on any of the other litigation around these questions that's been proceeding in other courts. So, for the most part, this is deferring a decision and kicking the cat down the road, although it will have immediate impacts in Idaho. So, what were the major differences between how the liberal justices and the conservative justices approached this case? It was very interesting, because, essentially, this is an administrative order, but there were four written opinions. The conservatives, the three most conservative justices, Justice Alito, who, of course, wrote the opinion overturning Roe two years ago, Justice Thomas and Justice Gorsuch, dissented. They said that they could have decided the case now and they would have upheld the Idaho law. The three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, all sided with the Biden administration and indicated that they would overturn the Idaho law. And, in fact, Justice Jackson said the court shouldn't have waited, the court should have decided this now. She wrote an opinion. And to show how strongly she felt, she took the unusual step of reading it from the bench this morning. She wrote, in part: \"This court had a chance to bring clarity and certainty to a tragic situation, and we have squandered it. And for as long as we refuse to declare what the law requires, pregnant patients in Idaho, Texas, and elsewhere will be paying the price.\" As for the other justices, Justice Barrett wrote an opinion in which she agreed that it should go back, that it wasn't ready, but she didn't tip her hand on the larger question. And Chief John Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh didn't write at all, so we have no idea where they are. OK. Well, as Amna mentioned, the court also blocked an EPA regulation meant to protect states downwind from polluting neighbors. Tell us about that ruling. This is a plan called — that the EPA calls Good Neighbors. They wanted to work with the states to limit air pollution that drifts across state lines. This was challenged by the state of Ohio and some corporate interests. Today, in a 5-2 — 5-4 decision, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote that the challenges were unlikely — I'm sorry — the challengers were likely to prevail in the end because the EPA had not fully justified what they were doing. The EPA has lost a handful of cases before the court in recent years. Is there a theme that connects these cases? Oh, absolutely. There is a — this conservative majority in this court has really — it's been consistent in trying to rein in what they call the administrative state. They say — they have said in case after case, not only in environmental law, but in other regulatory agencies, saying that the regulators can't do anything unless they're specifically authorized to do it by law. Here's Coral Davenport, who covers environmental policy for The New York Times. Coral Davenport, The New York Times: The broader theme of this is the court kind of really acting consistently in this very preliminary fashion to kind of shut down regulations before they even get on the books, before they're even hitting the American economy. And that's a really striking new trend from the court. We're really seeing it. In particular, this is a court that doesn't like regulations, that doesn't like the administrative state, but the Environmental Protection Agency, environmental rules, in particular, are really kind of being hamstrung before they even get out the door. And, in fact, today, the state — the court took another swipe at a regulatory agency. They said the SEC's use of internal panels, of administrative judges, to decide or to judge civil claims about securities fraud were unconstitutional because they violated the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial. And lastly, John, there was this major ruling where the justices rejected this bankruptcy agreement that would have protected the personal finances of the family behind Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin. And there were a lot of states that were depending and they were expecting to get some of that money. Why send this back to the negotiating table? Well, the major issue here was the fact that this agreement, or what they originally agreed to, painstakingly negotiated over a series of months, protected the Sackler filing — family, said they could not have — that shielded them from civil lawsuits against them. That made a lot of the families angry, but also some of the families wanted this to go forward, so they would get the money from this agreement, this settlement. And also the states wanted to get the money from the settlement to fight opioid addiction. But the — there was another 5-4 decision, and Justice Neil Gorsuch said there was nothing in the bankruptcy law that allowed this, because the Sacklers weren't filing for bankruptcy themselves. They were a third party, and you can't do that, according to how Justice Gorsuch interpreted the bankruptcy law. John Yang, thank you so much for walking us through all this. We appreciate it.

(WCTV) - Severe weather swept through the Big Bend of Florida and South Georgia Friday morning. A squall line containing wind gusts of 60+ mph, small hail, and heavy downpours moved into the western reaches of the Big Bend and South Georgia just before sunrise. Several tornado warnings were issued along the leading edge of the line. As the line approached the eastern reaches of Gadsden County and eventually Leon County in Florida, [a total of potentially three tornadoes were observed](https://www.wctv.tv/2024/05/10/early-reports-indicate-up-3-tornadoes-twisted-friday-gadsden-county-per-leon-county/) on the radar. They were moving from the northwest towards the southeast into Leon County. As depicted below, debris was being lofted very high into the sky, which is indicative of a tornado on the ground. The Tallahassee Airport recorded a thunderstorm wind gust of 65mph. On the campus of Florida A&M in Tallahassee, a destructive wind gust of 84mph was recorded. Crews with the National Weather Service will conduct damage surveys to determine what was damaged by straight-lined winds, and what was damaged by tornadoes. The storms devastated the capital city and surrounding area. Shortly after the worst of the severe weather passed through the area, the Leon County Sheriff’s Office [reported a woman died after a tree crashed onto a home during the storm](https://www.wctv.tv/2024/05/10/lcso-one-dead-after-tree-falls-home/). [Schools across the region canceled classes Friday](https://www.wctv.tv/2024/05/10/fsu-famu-tcc-closed-due-storm-damage/) amid the waves of rain and wind.
