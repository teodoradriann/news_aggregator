    "title": "\"No Magic without this dude right here\" - Magic Johnson fondly mimics Julius Erving's iconic plays and pays tribute to his hero - NewsBreak",
    "text": "By John Jefferson Tan ,\n52 minutes ago\nMagic Johnson is undeniably one of the most fun and charismatic among the legendary figures in NBA history. He has a unique ability to bring joy and excitement to every moment he shares with his fellow NBA legends, making each gathering a memorable experience.\nDuring a private link-up with the great Julius Erving at The Brentwood Oasis in California in 2023, Johnson once again showcased his entertaining spirit. In front of a small yet enthusiastic audience, the Los Angeles Lakers icon delighted everyone by playfully mimicking some of \"Dr. J's\" most iconic plays.\nAs expected, Magic's performance was not just a plain imitation as it was infused with his trademark charisma and humor, captivating those in attendance, including Erving himself.\nMagic personally paid tribute to \"Dr. J\" Some may have already forgotten, but Johnson followed in Erving's footsteps as he made his way into the pros. After two seasons at UMass, Julius leaped into the pros and joined the ABA. Like \"Dr. J,\" Magic also spent two remarkable years at Michigan State and declared for the NBA Draft following a sensational NCAA championship run.\nTo this day, Johnson still vividly recalls the pivotal moment when Erving played a crucial role in guiding him with his big decision. During their mini-reunion, Magic took the opportunity to pay tribute to Erving, expressing his deep gratitude for the profound impact that \"The Doctor\" had on his life and career.\nIn front of his idol, \"Buck\" emphasized how Erving's guidance helped shape his path towards NBA superstardom. Together, the pair shared a wholesome and heartfelt moment.\n\" This dude here, [is] my hero right here, my hero. Thank you… See, everybody remember, Doc had to shoes before anybody. [Converse] The Docs. Then in college, I call him and say I'd like to talk to you because you left college early, can you give me some advice? He said I'm gonna do you one better, I'mma fly you to Philly and you gonna hang with me. Now, I'm in college… Then we go out… Man, [Dr. J] is first class right here. [There's] No Magic without this dude right here,\" Magic told Erving.\n\"Dr. J\" went from being Magic's hero to foe In a separate occasion, Johnson detailed how Erving influenced his decision to go pro in such a profound way. In his reflection, Magic opened up about feeling elated by the rare opportunity to be taken under the wing of the future Hall of Famer.\nTrue to form, Johnson wound up in the NBA and became one of the biggest names in the league, just like Erving. However, Magic admitted that it was kind of bittersweet to face \"Dr. J ,\" his mentor, in the NBA Finals. At that point, the legendary point guard put his admiration for Erving aside and prioritized what mattered most: winning an NBA championship.\n\"I was like 'What did you just say?' So he [Dr.J] said it again and so I hung up the phone and I'm howling and screaming 'Guess what everybody!! I'm going to Dr. J's house.' I'm going crazy, I couldn't hold it and I'm going around the street telling everybody that I'm going to be staying in Dr. J's house,\" the three-time MVP once recalled .\n\"So I get there and he's talking to me and I'm just mesmerized right? I don't care if I'm sleeping on the floor or on the couch, I sleep anywhere. So, I went to sleep, woke up, went to the Playoff game, and who would've ever thought, this was how it ended up as blessing. I ended up playing in the NBA championships in my first year as a rookie six or seven months later, I'm in the Finals against Dr. J,\" Magic recounted.\n\"I love that man but he was in between me and that NBA championship. I wasn't going to let him beat me and you know that series, I'm still the only player in NBA history to be named Finals MVP as a rookie,\" he added.\nRelated: LeBron James recalls when he started with his famous powder pre-game ritual: \"I started throwing it up a little bit one time, and they got a little bit more excited\"\nMagic and Doc are two of the most electrifying players of all time Johnson and Erving are not only celebrated as two of the greatest basketball players in the history of the sport, but they also stand out as remarkable entertainers who captivated audiences across the globe. Their extraordinary talent, combined with their charismatic personalities, created a lasting impact on the game.\nBoth icons are renowned for their flashy, graceful, and electrifying styles of play, which transformed the way basketball was viewed on a larger scale. With his incredible passing skills and court vision, Magic brought a sense of creativity and flair to the game. Similarly, \"Dr. J\" mesmerized fans with his acrobatic dunks and athleticism, pushing the boundaries of what was generally deemed possible on the court.\nAs great athletes, two icons played a significant role in popularizing basketball, elevating it from a niche sport to a global phenomenon. Their historic performances not only made the game more interesting and competitive but also infused it with a level of entertainment that drew fans in like never before.\nRelated: Magic Johnson breaks down what made Jerry Buss the greatest owner in NBA history: \"Once \"Showtime\" over with, we're gonna go upstairs and have a good time\"\n6",

    "title": "British Steel closure threat puts up to 2,700 jobs at risk",
    "text": "Thousands of jobs at risk as British Steel threatens closure\nBritish Steel is launching a consultation that could see the closure of its two blast furnaces at Scunthorpe, putting up to 2,700 jobs at risk out of a workforce of 3,500.\nThe company said the blast furnaces were \"no longer financially sustainable\" due to tough market conditions, the imposition of tariffs and higher environmental costs.\nThe BBC understands British Steel was expecting a £1bn injection of government money to keep the business going, but was offered £500m.\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesperson said the government had made a \"generous offer\" to British Steel and it would continue to work with the company and its Chinese owner Jingye to secure its future.\nBritish Steel chief executive Zengwei An said the consultations on the closure were \"a necessary decision given the hugely challenging circumstances the business faces\".\nThe director general of trade group UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said British Steel's announcement was a \"pivotal moment\" for the sector and the steel industry was \"officially in a crisis\".\nCommunity union general secretary Roy Rickhuss called it \"a dark day\" and urged Jingye and the UK Government \"to resume negotiations before it is too late\".\nThe GMB union called it \"devastating news\", while Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said the potential job losses were \"a disgrace\".\n\"British Steel is guilty of trying to hold the government to ransom, while using its dedicated workforce as pawns,\" she said.\nBritish Steel has been owned by Jingye since 2020. The Chinese firm says it has invested more than £1.2bn into British Steel to maintain operations and claims it suffered financial losses of around £700,000 a day.\nThe company has put forward a £2bn business plan, which was set out on Wednesday by the company's chief commercial officer Allan Bell speaking to the Business & Trade Select Committee.\n''We have concluded that the only viable option for British Steel moving forward to decarbonise is to move to 100% electric arc furnace steelmaking,\" he said.\n\"This is a £2bn project we estimate so it is not a project that the private sector is going to be able to implement without government support.''\nThe BBC understands that there had been an expectation the government would meet this investment on a 50/50 basis.\nBut the government offered £500m, and this was rejected by British Steel.\nAnswering an urgent question on the future of Scunthorpe steelworks, Business and Trade Minister Sarah Jones told the House of Commons the government had made a \"generous conditional offer of financial support\".\nShe said the offer followed \"months of intensive engagement with British Steel\".\nJones said the company had to \"provide the commitments we need and which tax payers would quite rightly expect in exchange for substantial public funding\".\n\"It is regrettable that they have not yet done so or accepted our offer.\"\nShe called on the company to reconsider its closure plans and accept the government's offer.\nBritish Steel said it would \"continue to work with the UK government to explore options for the future of the business\".\nThe company is starting a formal consultation with its workforce and unions over three options:\n- The closure of the blast furnaces, steelmaking operations and Scunthorpe Rod Mill by early June 2025\n- The closure of the blast furnaces and steelmaking operations in September 2025\n- The closure of the blast furnaces and steelmaking operations at a future point beyond September 2025.\nBusiness and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: \"I know this will be a deeply worrying time for staff and, while this is British Steel's decision, we will continue working tirelessly to reach an agreement with the company's owners to secure its future and protect taxpayers' money.\n\"We've been clear there's a bright future for steelmaking in the UK. We've committed up to £2.5bn to rebuild the sector and will soon publish a Plan for Steel setting out how we can achieve a sustainable future for the workforce, industry and local communities.\"",

    "text": "New Delhi: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi slammed the Centre over the New Delhi Municipal Council's (NDMC) call to seek public opinion on the proposed demolition of the Sunehri Bagh Masjid in Delhi and said he wanted to know why the Narendra Modi-led government nurtures such hatred for the Muslims, news agency ANI reported. NDMC, which falls under the Union Ministry of Urban Development, sought suggestions from the people by January 1, on the proposed removal of the mosque. The mosque, situated on a roundabout in central Delhi, has been proposed to be removed on grounds of traffic snarls in the area.\nAccording to reports, the Delhi Waqf Board asserted that they own the land on which the mosque is situated, but the NDMC claims that the government owns the land.\nSpeaking to news agency ANI, Owaisi said, “This notification violates Article 25 of the constitution which guarantees freedom of religion which is a fundamental right. It violates Article 29 which ensures the protection of culture. It also violates section 51-1A of the Waqf Act 1995 which says that acquisition of waqf property can be done only when there is no other option.”\n#WATCH | Hyderabad: On Sunehri Bagh mosque, AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi says, \"...This notification violates Article 25 of the constitution which guarantees freedom of religion which is a fundamental right...

We want to know why does the BJP government under PM Narendra Modi nurture such hatred towards Muslims, mosques, and the 'azan'? There is also a place of worship in Nehru Place which leads to traffic snarls. There is no need to remove the Sunehri Masjid. There are so many roundabouts in the city. Why is the government after this one roundabout? We urge the government to withdraw this notification and not disturb the mosques,” Owaisi further said.\nSituated near the Udyog Bhawan, the Sunehri Masjid earned Heritage III status for its historical significance in 2009.",

    "text": "“The W13 Was My Biggest Mistake”: Toto Wolff Regrets Choosing ‘Wrong Approach’ That Proved to Be Detrimental in Mercedes’ Downfall [Vidit Dhawan](/author/viditdhawan/) |Published December 29, 2023 Mercedes have had a disappointing couple of campaigns as per their extremely high standards. Although the team finished second in the championship this season as compared to third in 2022, it still seemed like a downfall. The reason for the same is that the Silver Arrows failed to win a race for the first time as a Constructor in 2023. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff has now claimed that the W13 was his biggest mistake that has resulted in his side’s recent slump. Advertisement As quoted by gazzetta.it, Wolff [said](https://www.gazzetta.it/motori/mercedes-f1/28-12-2023/f1-wolff-rivela-la-mercedes-2022-il-piu-grande-errore-ecco-perche-l-ho-ripetuto.shtml?refresh_ce), “The W13 was my biggest mistake in recent years. We took the wrong approach to building the car for the 2022 season“. Since there was a significant amount of rule changes coming into the 2022 campaign, all teams had a level playing field. However, Mercedes surprisingly got their car horribly wrong at the start of the 2022 season. As a result of the same, they were always playing catch up to the likes of Red Bull and Ferrari. The main reason why the Silver Arrows struggled so much was because they failed to get the aspect of the ground-effect cars right. Advertisement Consequently, they were the team that struggled most with porpoising. It was only in the latter stages of the campaign that it seemed that Mercedes got a better grasp of the rules. Their hard work paid off eventually as they managed to register a spectacular win in Brazil with George Russell. Their win in Sao Paulo was also the reason why Wolff revealed that they did not consider changing the idea of their 2023 car. He then concluded by stating that he doesn’t regret his decision despite it being a mistake in hindsight, as most teams considered their performance in Brazil as a key metric to develop their 2023 car. Toto Wolff has revealed Mercedes will change their 2024 car completely Since it became apparent that [Mercedes](https://thesportsrush.com/tag/mercedes/) had not got the concept of their car right this season, they have plans to bring an entirely new idea for the 2024 campaign. In a recent interview, Toto Wolff explained how his side will change the W15 completely. He [said](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0w1qDEpVFU/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=4937d8e1-e188-4ede-bfa1-0b6f40a0be66) that they will change everything that is possible to change. Some of the key parts include the chassis and the aerodynamics. Wolff is hopeful that bringing these changes could help steer Mercedes in the right direction to reduce the gap to the utterly dominant Red Bull in 2024.

In a recent interview (as quoted by racingnews365.com), he [stated](https://racingnews365.com/russell-wants-clean-slate-from-mercedes-with-2024-car#:~:text=George%20Russell%20expects%20Mercedes'%202024,unfulfilled%20potential%20from%20the%20W14.&text=George%20Russell%20wants%20Mercedes%20to,unfulfilled%20potential%20with%20the%20W14.) that he expects the W15 to be a “clean slate“. As a result, Russell revealed that he has no doubt that they will be in a stronger position in Bahrain next year as compared to earlier this season. Irrespective of how much gain do Mercedes actually make, it is pertinent to note that catching up to Red Bull will be a tall order. The Milton Keynes outfit obliterated the field in 2023 as they registered a record 21 wins out of 22 and will definitely have the advantage in development as well as compared to their rivals. Thus, instead of looking to catch up to Red Bull, Mercedes may need to reconsider their objectives of ensuring that they keep the likes of Ferrari and McLaren behind first. This is because towards the end of the 2023 campaign, it seemed that both the Prancing Horse and the team from Woking had a stronger car than the Silver Arrows. Advertisement Share this article",

    "text": "Portada\nmis comunidades\notras secciones\n[#4](c4#c-4) Es una manera de verlo. Otra es que unos cuantos españoles se han marchado a países menos corruptos, han visto que se vive mejor así y evitan votar a los partidos que mantienen aquí niveles indecentes de corrupción.\nPero hay de todo…\n[#4](c4#c-4) te recomiendo algo más de fibra en tu dieta, parece que aún no has digerido el que no ganaran los tuyos\n[#4](c4#c-4) que yo conozca la gente que emigra a EEUU normalmente son gente con títulos superiores donde irse a América es muy buena opción laboral, y ya esta, si votan a la izquierda española sera porque ven desde fuera que es mejor opción.\nQue pasa con los que votan a la derecha?\nQue significaria?\nPor cierto a mayor nivel de estudios el votante de izquierda aumenta, tampoco dices nada de eso?\n[#52](c52#c-52) Gente con estudios y que no está sometida al bombardeo propagandístico de la fachosfera hispana. No veo qué tiene de curioso, la verdad.\n[#83](c83#c-83) Ya, y, en esos casos, gente que en las elecciones votan a los que menos quieren que España se parezca a donde se han tenido que ir ellos. Qué sí, que en España estamos lejos de tener un partido liberal decente, pero vivir las mieles del capitalismo en Estados Unidos, Reino Unido, Irlanda, Países Bajos y andar votando en España a Podemos, me parece poco coherente. Lo curioso es que pocos de estos se han ido a Venezuela o a Cuba a disfrutar en su piel los múltiples beneficios del socialismo.\n[#84](c84#c-84) El programa de la derecha para España consiste en hambre y moscas para todo el que no sea millonario o una gran empresa: corrupción, bajadas de impuestos para los ricos, privatizaciones, precarización del empleo, desmantelamiento de los servicios públicos y especulación inmobiliaria. Ante este panorama, para votar a la derecha es necesario ser idiota, ignorante, egoísta o millonario, por lo que la mayor parte de sus votantes son gente corta de entendederas enajenda por la incesante propaganda.\nLa prueba es que no dedican ningún esfuerzo en hablar de sus propuestas económicas: sólo hablan de ETA, la ley de amnistía, y lo malvados que son Perrosanxe y su mujer.\n[#37](c37#c-37) Ay pobres comunistas que el problema que tienen es que son dependientes de importar todo de EEUU.\nPues que sepas que la mayoría del pollo en Cuba viene de Miami, el embargo está hoy en día muy limitado.\nAh, y en la guerra fría había más gente en el bloque comunista que en el bloque capitalista.. y aun así al bloque capitalista le iba mil veces mejor y no necesitaban para nada a los comunistas.\n[#1](c1#c-1) No veo relación entre el fanatismo religioso cristiano y los problemas político sociales en latinoamérica.\nEl Salvador es de los países más evangélicos, junto a Brasil, y las cosas les han empezado a ir bien.\nArgentina y Venezuela no son países de corte religioso evangélico y están comiendo mierda.\nEn Cuba ni religiosos son, y no tienen ni para comer mierda.\n[#33](c33#c-33) derecha y diosito van siempre juntitos, si te convenzo que estás en la tierra para sufrir a cambio de una recompensa cuando te mueras, aguantas mejor que te pisen, porque a mayor sufrimiento mayor recompensa\n[#33](c33#c-33) Simple, estos tipos se oponen al planamiento familiar.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4449999/\n[#1](c1#c-1) por no hablar de que sus antepasados se arrancarían los pelos de desesperación por ver como han abrazado la religión que los masacró\n[#47](c47#c-47) sus antepasados católicos españoles o ver como se pasan al evangelismo siendo sus antepasados católicos?\n[#1](c1#c-1) con la diferencia de que cuando vienen para acá muchos de ellos se vuelven muy de derechas besando los pies de sus verdugos.. los cuales por delante les dicen, con papeles inmigrante bueno, y por detrás le dicen a los españoles, mirad, estos son los que os roban el trabajo y las paguitas..\nY los testigos de Jehová. Antes estaban a la salida de los hospitales con sus plafones. Ahora los veo en: la salida del metro, de los parques y en cualquier esquina o paseo. De 3 en 3. Si no les miras no te molestan, al menos en mi experiencia, pero me parece preocupante cómo van invadiendo el espacio público para su negocio de proselitismo religioso. ¿Puedo plantar un plafón con folletos de mi empresa 7 u 8 horas allá dónde me apetezca y abordar a los transeúntes?\n[#3](c3#c-3) al igual que llevan toda la vida ocupando espacio publico los mendigos, los que reparten folletos, los grupos de turistas guiados.... mientras la ocupacion no sea permanente, no hay problema\n[#3](c3#c-3) En mi pequeña ciudad de 40k habitantes el otro día me crucé a cuatro así, todos eran latinos. Les dije con palabras poco amables que se fueran con sus historias a su templo, que la calle no era lugar para ello. Eran muy ridículos, hablaban con una grandiosidad típica de pastor evangélico y que si la gloria de dios y mierdas así. Llamé a la policía. Me parece sumamente preocupante esto. Uno de ellos aún venía con ese falso buen rollo a \"debatir\" conmigo y me hacía preguntas de lo más ridículas. Largo de la calle por favor.\n[#21](c21#c-21) y que pasó cuando llamaste a la policía? Que te dijeron los guardias? conseguiste que se fueran?\n[#42](c42#c-42) Se fueron a la hora aproximadamente, pero no sé si por su propio pie o por la policía, ya que yo volví donde ellos media hora larga después y ahí seguían. La poli dijo que iba a mandar una patrulla y vi un coche una hora después de llamarles, pero capaz que iban a otro sitio, así que no puedo confirmar. Me olía que estos predicadores eran evangélicos pagados por alguien de aquí o de allá para hacer la ruta, porque el brasileño tenía un acento increíble y hablaba español justo.\n[#3](c3#c-3) pero esos, \"por fortuna\", son tan radicales que no van a ser mayoría nunca y hasta la fecha no se meten en política. Por lo demás, totalmente de acuerdo.\n[#3](c3#c-3) En mi bloque ahora dejan cartas en los buzones diciendo que te van a solucionar la vida y te dejan su WhatsApp y una dirección para que vayas a sus reuniones. Se aprovechan de gente ignorante y desesperada. Menuda secta.\n[#71](c71#c-71) trabajan como cualquiera, yo conozco al alguna familia con hijos, compañeros de clase de mis hijos. Es gente normal de puertas para fuera. Luego ya ves que los nenes no se reúnen con los otros para jugar o celebraciones, no van a excursiones... En fin, las relaciones de los chavales se limitan a las horas de clase y su entorno familiar o religioso. También he conocido a una chica que cuando pudo lo dejó, pero tienen que renunciar a su familia y a todo lo que ha vivido desde que nació. Llevaba trabajando en el negocio familiar desde adolescente sin sueldo, así que hay que ser valiente.\nDan bastante pena, la verdad.\nSon una secta y se comporta como tal.\nYo lo llamaría \"fe seudocristiana\", porque muchas veces esto no está movido por una fe religiosa, sino que la fe religiosa es solo el medio para mover otra cosa, por ejemplo, mantener a la gente distraída odiando el aborto o a los homosexuales mientras no se dan cuenta de que otros se están quedando con la mayor parte de su esfuerzo al trabajar.\n[#74](c74#c-74): A lo que me refiero es a que la religión es el medio, no el fin. Si no hubiera religiones, buscarían otras maneras de crear fanatismo para mantener despistada a la gente, como el fútbol, que actualmente también se usa un poco en ese sentido, mientras odias a otro equipo no te preocupas de que te suben los precios y no los salarios.\n[#80](c80#c-80) si te he entendido perfectamente. Siempre habrá gente que necesite algo y desaprensivos que se aprovechen de esa necesidad.\nLo peor es que muchos de esos nuevos templos se construyen en base a la necesidad de las gentes que acuden a ellos, aportan \"lo que no tienen\" y cuatro vividores y sus comparsas se hacen de oro. Para colmo, les adoctrinan con ideología neoliberal envuelta en el evangelio de \"san saduceo\" , que les promete la \"prosperidad\", sobre todo la material, demonizando todo sentido crítico que les haga pensar que ese sistema económico es el que les mantiene en la servidumbre y la desigualdad y del que muy pocos saldrán , que siempre son los que les piden el diezmo y lo que haga falta \"para el culto\", que no es otro que el que zarandea un libro con dorso dorado y una cruz desde el atril...\n[#24](c24#c-24) si algo mueve dinero, sobre todo si es en paraisos fiscales, allí estará el PP para ver qué pilla.\nEsa gente es muy peligrosa, ya que al contrario que otras sectas, quieren acaparan todas las instancias del estado. Su avaricia no tiene límites, son capaces de vender a su madre por cuatro duros.\nLa religión era prácticamente la única cosa de LATAM que EEUU no controlaba, pero con el evangelismo es probable que en una década o dos reemplace al catolicismo en cantidad de seguidores.\nLas personas más insoportables del mundo son los conversos en cualquier modo. Religión, pelo blanco, deporte, vegetariano..., debe ser como ves que tu vida es una mierda y te has equivocado quieres imponer a los demás tu vida de p... Mierda",

    "title": "Heading platoons, repairing machines and doing twice as much: How the war has changed the lives of Ukrainian women - Egypt Independent",
    "text": "Kyiv CNN — Most of the men in Oksana Rubanyak’s platoon are at least 10 years older than her. Before the war, having a young woman in charge of an all-male Ukrainian military unit might have given the troops pause. But as the platoon prepares for a frontline deployment at a time Ukraine is desperately trying to hold off Russian advances, things like gender and age no longer matter that much, Rubanyak said. It’s a huge change compared to when she first joined the army two years ago.\n“Women are recognized, women are promoted to combat positions, to officer positions. These are no longer just medical or headquarters roles,” she told CNN in a phone interview. Female soldiers are now participating in assaults, she said. “And I am very happy about it.”\nThe number of women in the military has increased significantly since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with more than 62,000 women currently serving in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, according to official statistics. More than 5,000 are serving in the combat zone, like Rubanyak, who is now 21.\nRubanyak was 19 when she joined the Ukrainian army as a volunteer. She served near Bakhmut and was, as now, the only woman in her platoon. She operated a heavy machine gun and, while she did everything the men did, she said she experienced some level of bias – such as some men trying to stop her from carrying heavy weapons.\n“I heard people saying behind my back that I must be someone’s daughter, that my father would promote me and so on. It was something new for many people. Everyone was trying to find a catch, that just didn’t exist,” she said.\nAnd while she said that there have been many positive changes in the past two years, there is still work to do. “Everything takes time,” she said. “Although all the conditions for women to serve in the army are there now, if they choose to.”\nWorking two jobs As more and more Ukrainians join the war effort, the country’s women are increasingly stepping in – and not just in the military.\nThe Ukrainian government doesn’t disclose how many people have signed up to the armed forces in the last two years. However, it’s clear that hundreds of thousands have swapped their day jobs for military service.\nWith new waves of military conscription expected soon, employers are facing a new problem: how to fill the vacancies left by the men drafted. At the same time, hundreds of thousands of women have left the country, seeking refuge abroad.\nAccording to the National Bank of Ukraine, employers nationwide are currently facing a shortage of about 60,000 skilled workers, an increase of some 20,000 since 2021.\nWith so many unfilled vacancies, women are often picking up the slack. A number of Ukrainian organizations and companies are offering training courses for women for some of the jobs conventionally thought of as male roles.\nHalyna Shevchenko knows this firsthand. She works in a repair department of the Ukrainian Railways in the Poltava region. Before the war, she managed a team of 10 men who repaired complex parts of railway cars. When two of her colleagues were mobilized, the company couldn’t find anyone to fill their specialized positions.\nSo, Shevchenko started to learn the technical skills and now does some of the repairs herself. With women making up 40% of Ukrainian Railways’ employees, she is likely not the only one.\n“We have some tasks where male colleagues prepare everything for me as much as possible, and then I do them because the men need help. Before the war, I had never done this on my own, I only supervised the process,” she told CNN.\nThe new tasks – and the war – have significantly increased her workload.\nHalyna Shevchenko, left, is among the Ukrainian women stepping up during the war to do what have traditionally been seen as “men’s jobs.” Department of Information Policy and Public Strategic Communications\nThe Ukrainian Railways told CNN that 10,200 of their 190,000 employees have been mobilized, with 600 having been killed in the war since the beginning of the war. At the same time, the railways have become the vital arteries of Ukraine since Russia’s attacks have halted passenger air travel and severely limited shipping through the Black Sea .\nThe railways have carried more than 40 million passengers and huge amounts of cargo since the war began. The company has also introduced all sorts of new, military-focused services, including evacuation trains for wounded soldiers.\nAll of that means that Shevchenko’s team has to carry out more repairs.\n“I am a techie, just like my colleagues. That’s why we communicate with the guys on an equal footing. We complement each other and consult on complex repairs,” she said.\nWar and the economy Kernel, one of Ukraine’s largest agricultural producers and exporters, has also started to look for solutions to the worker shortages.\n“There is a shortage of both women and men in the labor market. We have lowered the requirements for candidates and introduced basic training programs where a person can learn to become a laboratory assistant or a (machine) operator from scratch,” Natalia Teryakhina, Kernel’s HR director, told CNN.\nThe company has also started training women to be boiler operators – a job women didn’t tend to do before the war.\n“We piloted this project… to prove that women can work in conventionally male occupations. It was a successful experiment, and all the women continue to work,” she said.\nShevchenko said she is determined to keep doing the “man’s job” of fixing railway cars for as long as is needed. She has built up a good rapport with her team and said she feels respected by them.\n“As long as I have enough health and strength, I will do everything to help my colleagues as much as possible – until the end, until we win,” she said.",

    "text": "Welcome to the weekend, buds. Hope you’re staying warm on this wonderful Saturday — a lot of the [coldest temperatures recorded in every state](https://www.businessinsider.com/coldest-temperature-on-record-every-state) happened during January. Speaking of weekends, I chatted with some time-management experts about how to get the most from your weekends. That’s today’s big story. What’s on deck: But first, what’re you up to this weekend? If this was forwarded to you, [sign up here.](https://www.businessinsider.com/subscription/newsletter/insider-today) Don’t let the weekend get away from you Weekends seem like such a simple concept — two days away from work. But most people aren’t feeling refreshed or rested after their days off. “People are so tired from the week that they get to the weekend and they think they want to do nothing,” Laura Vanderkam, the author of “168 Hours: You Have More Time Than You Think,” told me. “The problem is, it’s impossible to do nothing — you’ll do something. But it might not be nearly as rejuvenating as if you put a tiny bit of thought into it,” she added. So time-management experts shared how to prevent that from happening to you. Plan “anchor events” for your weekend Vanderkam defined an anchor event as something you want to do during the weekend — any activity that’s loosely planned ahead of time. She recommends having three to five of them over the course of a weekend. And Vanderkam has a general formula of three activity categories that lead to people feeling they had a good weekend: socializing, physical activity, and a spiritual activity (when you feel part of something bigger than yourself). “If you think of choosing one thing from each of those categories and putting it somewhere in the weekend, you will probably hit Monday feeling like, ‘Oh yeah, that was good.'” Time-bound your responsibilities — and your free time Vanderkam said there are 36 waking hours between 6 p.m. Friday and 6 a.m. Monday. So there’s a lot of time to balance responsibilities and time for yourself. She recommends thinking of the weekend in five chunks: Friday night, Saturday day, Saturday night, Sunday day, Sunday night. This can help you time and plan weekend activities and responsibilities. Time-management coach Alexis Haselberger told me that a lot of her clients struggle with relaxation and putting work down. This can be worsened when you schedule an unrealistic responsibility load into your weekend. The outstanding tasks in the back of your mind can make you feel like you didn’t have a weekend — and makes you feel bad for not completing it. She recommended making a manageable to-do list and blocking time off to complete the tasks. People can experiment with balancing responsibilities and free time, she said, since creating a fulfilling weekend is so individualized and requires work. Plus, Vanderkam said if you do finish all your tasks — don’t go looking for new ones to do. Try something new You’re not really creating new memories while binging Netflix, scrolling TikTok, or chilling around your home. So this can make it feel like you did nothing over the weekend, Haselberger said. She told me that people often think doing these activities will help you decompress from the week — “and it does in the moment, but then it doesn’t. And then we’re scrambling to do all of the things.” Haselberger recommends that people ask themselves: What can you do on the weekend that is outside of something that you would normally do to make the weekend feel like it was a prolonged period of time?
