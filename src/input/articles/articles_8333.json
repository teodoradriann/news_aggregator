    "text": "A team from EPA Victoria has undertaken a compliance audit on a Deer Park chemical manufacturer and investigated breaches of its licence following a report of a strong odour from its Ballarat Rd plant.\nThe smell wasn't the only thing that left Hexion Pty Ltd; $9,880 of the company's money will go to paying a fine for failing to report the incident to the environmental regulator.\nEPA Western Metropolitan Regional Manager Carly McGregor says when members of the public reported the odour on 2 April 2025, an EPA team was on site and opening the investigation within hours.\n\"There's a clear message for any business with an EPA licence or permission,\" Ms McGregor said.\n\"That licence comes with conditions designed to protect the environment and the community. The conditions are backed by the law and must be taken seriously,\" she said.\n\"In this case, the first calls came from members of the public, an EPA team was on the premises the same day and launched an examination of all aspects of the company's compliance with its licence,\" she said.\nThe facility operates under an EPA Operating Licence and one of the conditions of the licence is that it must report any breaches immediately.\nEPA officers are now assessing whether to issue a regulatory notice requiring the company to make improvements to reduce the risk of future leaks.\nUnder the Environment Protection Act 2017 and the Infringements Act 2006, the operator has the right to have the infringement notice reviewed or be considered by a court.\nMembers of the public can report pollution by calling EPA's 24-hour hotline on 1300 372 842 or providing details online at epa.vic.gov.au/report-pollution/reporting-pollution\nhere.",

    "title": "Will Remote Work Continue To Work as We Head Toward 2024? A Look at the Post-Pandemic Years",
    "text": "Globally, workers have fallen in love with remote work, but according to reports, about 64% of executives believe it’s time to return to the office. It’s hard to be sure of what the future of work will look like. But there’s one thing we can do, and that’s to look at trends.\nLet’s take a closer look at some trending contrasting opinions and realities of remote work as we head into 2024.\nCEOs Say Remote Work Will End Soon\nAccording to experts, global executives believe that the time of remote work is almost up. As stated in the\nKPMG Global CEO Outlook, 64% of global executives believe 2026 will be the year the world will return to full in-office work. CEOs further say they are exploring incentives and perks to make on-site work more attractive than remote work.\nThis greatly clashes with what employees want. Unsurprisingly, workers who have been fully remote over the past three years don’t want to return to the office. Less commuting, no more strict\nwork outfits, personalized workspaces, flexible work hours, and enhanced work-life balance are just a few obvious benefits of working remotely.\nIn\na study by Gallup, 90% of workers say they don’t want to return to entirely on-site work. In fact, many employees are willing to let go of their jobs that don’t offer them the flexibility they want.\nSince the great resignation began in early 2021, employers have been worried about losing their biggest talents because of flexibility issues. However, with industries finding their balance and new talents aggressively developing, power seems to be shifting back to employers. It’s interesting to see how the next few years will play out.\nOne of the most vocal CEOs about his dislike for remote work is Elon Musk. Not only did the Tesla CEO send a notorious email to workers last year necessitating a minimum of 40 hours per week, but the recent 2023\nQ3 Tesla Earnings Call featured Musk labeling remote workers as “detached from reality.”\nMusk has a long history of disdain for remote work, but in recent times, several other CEOs have queued behind his narrative of ending remote work. In August 2023, in an ironic move, Zoom reversed its fully remote work culture to mandate employees within 50 miles of the company back to the office.\nIt doesn’t end there. Meta (formerly Facebook) also recently initiated a 3-day office workday policy. These hybrid setups have proven to be a feasible compromise between employers wanting to maximize work hours and employees who love the taste of remote work.\nAre All Companies Against Remote Work?\nThe short answer is ‘No.” There are global companies that remain supportive and invested in remote work. For instance, Gumroad has a fully remote work culture, with “no meetings” being one the company is known for.\nDrew Houston, the CEO of Dropbox, gives a contrasting view of the future of remote work. According to the CEO, “If you trust people and treat them like adults, they will behave like adults.” With his company’s 90/10 rule — 90% of the year for remote work and 10% for off-site events — Houston demonstrates trust in people staying productive irrespective of location.\nAnd he’s not the only one. More global companies are encouraging employees to work on schedules and systems that are flexible and convenient for them.\nWho Are Big Remote Work Advocates?\nRemote work and hybrid arrangements are excellent for companies that are all about employees getting their jobs done and not when such employees log on. Expectedly, different companies have slightly varying ways of handling this need for flexibility.\nAdobe\nOne of the established computer software companies that continue to support the remote work parade is Adobe. In the words of Gloria Chen, Adobe’s Chief People Officer, “While we believe in the value of in-person interaction, we know that in some cases, a remote work arrangement makes sense for Adobe…”\nThe company created a smart digital campus app called Adobe Life to make\nremote work more inclusive for employees. Thanks to the app, workers can keep up to date with company developments while also encouraging interpersonal relationships and communication.\nAirbnb\nFor a company that helps users find short lets around the world, it isn’t unprecedented to have its employees living and working from anywhere in the world. The company affirmed its work-from-anywhere policy in 2022 and hasn’t looked back since.\nAtlassian\nIn a\nblog post, Atlassian confirmed that about 300 of its 8000+ employees have moved to a new country since its fully remote work policy came into play. In the same vein, the company claims that more than 10% of its US-based workers relocated to a new state after the company established this policy. So far, Atlassian’s \"Team Anywhere\" initiative has enjoyed marked success, and the company continues to ship products that improve remote work efficiency for the world.\nHubSpot\nHaving a client list of 170,000 businesses relying on software created by the company hasn’t prevented it from sticking to its remote work resolve. The company has three work arrangements: working entirely remotely, going to the office twice a week, and going to the office three times a week.\nWhat Does the Future Hold for Remote Work?\nThere is more than one opinion on the future of work. With the remote work concept experiencing different realities in varying industries and diverse results, it posits not to be a one-size-fits-all model.\nHowever, trends like the rapid adoption of new tech tools, focus on employee well-being, hybrid work models, ease of remote onboarding and integration, emphasis on cybersecurity, and more are bolstering the development of a new culture. Even if remote work is not an option, companies can transfer its principles and benefits to the office environment. Business executives should embrace and adopt this work setup, which is vital to unlocking sustained productivity.",

    "text": "The shrine of a beloved Philadelphia saint sustained thousands of dollars' worth of damage in an apparent act of vandalism.\nPanels of three stained-glass windows were shattered at the National Shrine of St. John Neumann in Philadelphia in the early morning hours of Feb. 19.\nThe windows depicting scenes from the saint's life are located in the lower church of the shrine, which is housed at St. Peter the Apostle Church. The saint's remains -- covered by a wax mask and vestments, and encased in glass beneath the altar of the lower church -- were unaffected by the attack.\nStaff at the shrine \"discovered that someone had thrown a brick and stones\" through the three windows, said Kenneth A. Gavin, chief communications officer of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, in an emailed statement to OSV News.\n\"This incident was reported to the Philadelphia Police Department that day,\" said Gavin. \"The Shrine’s security camera showed one of the rocks going through the window at 5:33 a.m. Monday (Feb. 19) and landing in the choir section of the Shrine.\"\nGavin said that \"police detectives are currently reviewing security camera footage as part of an ongoing investigation,\" adding that the \"preliminary damage estimate to the windows is approximately $20,000.\"\nImages provided to OSV News Feb. 20 by a regular Mass attendee at the shrine show softball-sized holes in the exterior glass panels protecting the stained glass. The damaged interior panels were removed, with cardboard taped over the gaps.\nOne window shows the saint looking up from his desk, under the words \"Visions missionary, vocation to save faith of Immigrants to America.\"\nA second window shows the saint kneeling in obedience to his bishop; above him are the words \"First to join the Redemptorist Fathers in America.\"\nThe third window, which lost multiple panes to the attack, depicts St. John Neumann with fellow Redemptorist and 19th-century contemporary Blessed Francis Xavier Seelos. Above the pair is a quote from Seelos: \"Father Neumann was to me in every respect a father whom I can never forget.\"\nSimilarly damaged in the early hours of Feb. 19 were Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, located some 2.2 miles south of the shrine; the InterAct Theater, a mile west of Mother Bethel; and a law firm building half a mile from the theater in the city's downtown district.\nPolice have not yet advised if the incidents are related.\nBorn in 1811 in what is now the Czech Republic, John Nepomucene Neumann distinguished himself at an early age with his gift for learning and his zealous faith. As a seminarian, he discerned a call to minister to the immigrants of the U.S. Arriving in 1836, he was quickly ordained and set about missioning in his vast pastoral assignment, which extended from Lake Ontario to Pennsylvania.\nIn 1842, he joined the Redemptorist order as its first U.S. vocation, and gained U.S. citizenship in 1848. Appointed bishop of Philadelphia in 1852, he labored tirelessly on behalf of the impoverished immigrant communities, adopting their austere lifestyle, learning their languages and establishing the nation's first parochial school system for their children. Bishop Neumann also established Forty Hours devotion in the U.S.\nHe died of a sudden heart attack (sometimes reported as a stroke) in 1860 and was canonized by St. Paul VI in 1977.",

    "title": "'Hello Girl' honored with VA headstone, a century after serving in World War I",
    "text": "By Ryan Dickstein ,\n2 hours ago It's been more than a century since Marie Edmee LeRoux served in World War I.\nYes, women deployed with the military back then, but weren't recognized as veterans until 1977.\nAlthough it's been nearly 80 years since she was buried at Fort Lincoln Cemetery in Prince George's County, LeRoux still has no headstone commemorating her time with the U.S. Army.\nThat all changes May 3, thanks to several veteran organizations who worked together to finally honor her.\nIt was back in June 1918 when LeRoux answered the call for duty, sailing to France with the American Expeditionary Forces.\nThere she became part of the Army’s Signal Corps, also known as the “Hello Girls,\" a group of bilingual French-Speaking telephone operators.\nHello Girls were tasked with improving wartime communications by relaying messages about troop movements and supplies.\nThe United States saw this as an operational advantage on the battlefields throughout Europe.\nAfter spending just shy of one year overseas, LeRoux was honorably discharged in June 1919.\nUpon returning, the U.S. didn't acknowledge LeRoux's role in the Army, denying her veteran status and benefits.\nNow, since the laws have changed, LeRoux is able to have full proper military honors.\nLeRoux’s own granddaughter, Catherine Bourgin, will be in attendance for Friday's ceremony, as will Kimberly M. Jackson, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and Anthony C. Woods, Secretary of the Maryland Department of Veterans Affairs.\nRepresentatives from the Embassy of Canada, LeRoux’s native country, and the Embassy of France, will also be on hand to lay a wreath by her brand new headstone.\n“I am ecstatic that all of these organizations are honoring my grandmother,” said Bourgin. “It all happened so quickly. After her being in an unmarked grave for 79 years, I was able to work with the National Cemetery Administration to get an official marker for my grandmother’s grave.”\nThe WWI Centennial Commission says it's advocating for all \"Hello Girls\" to be recognized and honored by Congress.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",

Mañana será otro día\", declaró Davide Ancelotti tras el partido.\nDavide Ancelotti, que apostó por un sistema 4-4-2, alineó a John, Vitinho, Kaio Pantaleao, Alexander Barboza, Alex Telles, Allan, Marlon Freitas, Artur, Álvaro Montoro, Jefferson Savarino y Arthur Cabral como su primer 11 inicial como entrenador del Botafogo.\n\"Me gustó la primera parte. Empezamos con ritmo, queríamos hacerlo. Meter el balón en el área, ganar el segundo balón, evitar sus transiciones. Lo conseguimos. Empezamos bien la segunda parte también, pero luego perdimos algo de ritmo. Estoy contento con el rendimiento del equipo. No tuvimos suerte, perdimos algo de ritmo al final. Pero así son las cosas\", analizó.\nEl Botafogo, que suma 22 puntos y es sexto en la clasifación, jugará su próximo partido visitando al Sport Recife.",

    "text": "O Instagram apresentou instabilidade na tarde desta quinta-feira (14), causando preocupação entre os usuários. De acordo com o Downdetector, plataforma onde problemas de sites e aplicativos podem ser reportados, o pico de reclamações ocorreu às 17h20, quando muitos relatavam dificuldades para acessar o aplicativo ou carregar conteúdo. O que aconteceu O problema ocorre quando se tenta acessar perfis na [rede social](https://lorena.r7.com/categoria/Noticias/Australia-deve-proibir-acesso-a-redes-sociais-para-menores-de-16-anos), afetando tanto a versão mobile quanto a desktop, ambas apresentando instabilidade. O termo “Instagram com instabilidade” registrou um aumento nas buscas do Google Trends desde às 16h40. Aplicativos de mídia social são vistos em um iPhone (foto: reprodução/Jaap Arriens/Getty Images Embed) O Downdetector recebeu 84 notificações sobre o Instagram e diversos usuários relatam dificuldades para acessar o aplicativo. As dificuldades mais registradas foram quanto ao uso móvel (65% das reclamações), no login (19%) e na conexão com o servidor (16%). O aplicativo diz em sua página que interpreta a perspectiva dos relatórios de problemas enviados durante as últimas 24 horas, em comparação com o volume habitual de relatórios diários por hora. O Downdetector aponta um incidente quando o número de reclamações de problemas excede significativamente o volume habitual. Por esse motivo, é comum que problemas sejam relatados ao longo do dia. Outra rede foi utilizada As reclamações registradas após as 17h chegam de várias cidades, mas principalmente, de capitais brasileiras, incluindo São Paulo, Curitiba, Porto Alegre e Brasília. Os usuários relatam dificuldades ao tentar publicar conteúdo, além de serem impedidos de ter o acesso ao feed e aos Stories, uma vez que a plataforma comprometeu a postagem de fotos e vídeos planejados para o início do fim da semana. Ao tentar acessar o feed pelo desktop ou celular, o sistema exibe mensagem de que um erro ocorreu e por isso a página não pôde ser carregada. Usuários, no entanto, se valeram de outra rede e reclamaram do erro pelo X de [Elon Musk](https://lorena.r7.com/categoria/Noticias/Indecisos-eleitores-da-Pensilvania-recebem-incentivo-de-1-milhao-por-dia-de-Elon-Musk), antigo Twitter. Alguns sites de notícias procuraram a Meta, dona do Instagram, no intuito de conseguir mais informações e aguardam posicionamento, mas até o momento a rede social não se pronunciou sobre a causa da instabilidade.
