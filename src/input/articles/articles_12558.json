    "title": "15-Minute Chemical Recycling Could Help Tackle Fashion Industry Waste by Breaking Fabrics Into Reusable Molecules | Science Times",
    "text": "The fashion industry has contributed much to the world's waste volume, but a new method has been discovered that could potentially make clothes recyclable. Chemical Recycling to Address Fashion Industry Waste In a [new study](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02210-1), researchers discovered a novel way to break down fabrics and transform the material into reusable molecules. The process works even if the item contains a mixture of materials. Chemical recycling may breathe fresh vitality into worn-out materials. A large portion of recycling is physically sorting waste into raw materials. However, this method is not suitable for handling textiles. Various materials are combined to create fabrics, such as cotton, and synthetic fibers like polyester. Multi-fiber textiles are difficult to sort into items that mechanical recycling processes can reuse. However, per [Dionisios Vlachos](https://cbe.udel.edu/people/faculty/vlachos/), an engineer at the University of Delaware in Newark, the quality of what you get is lower. The researchers used chemical recycling to disassemble some synthetic fabric components into modular pieces that can be reused. They employed a chemical process known as [microwave-assisted glycolysis](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsomega.2c06297), which, with heat and a catalyst, can split long molecular chains, or polymers, into smaller pieces. This was used to process fabrics of various compositions, such as 50/50 polycotton, a blend of polyester and cotton, and 100% polyester. The reaction transformed ninety percent of the polyester in pure polyester fabric into a molecule known as BHET, which can be recycled straight into additional polyester textiles. According to the researchers' findings, it was able to break down the polyester and recover the cotton in polyester-cotton materials. The reaction did not affect cotton. Most importantly, the group reduced the reaction conditions to the point where the procedure only required 15 minutes, thus reducing the cost. According to Vlachos, it usually takes days to break them down, but chemical recycling can do it in minutes. He was hopeful to speed it up and go down into seconds. Additionally, the team hoped to develop the process further and scale it to treat more significant quantities of clothing. Vlachos and his associates calculated that 88% of apparel worldwide might be recycled with additional advancements.

It also requires a huge amount of resources. Textile production requires land and water to cultivate cotton and other fibers. Estimates suggest that [2,700 liters of fresh water](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20201208STO93327/the-impact-of-textile-production-and-waste-on-the-environment-infographics) are enough to cover one person's drinking needs for 2.5 years to produce a single cotton T-shirt. In 2020, the third-largest contributor to land use and water degradation was the textile industry. Each EU resident needed an average of 391 kg of raw materials, 400 square meters of land, and nine cubic meters of water to make clothing and shoes that year. Unfortunately, millions of clothes end up in landfills daily. Thus, chemical recycling will be handy, especially if it is developed to take on large quantities of clothing and make it available worldwide. RELATED ARTICLE: [Is Titanium Magnetic?

    "title": "Tampa's Black-Palestinian Solidarity Explored, Insights from Key Community Leaders Shared",
    "text": "On a pivotal day, February 24, the Tampa community came together at the C. Blythe Andrews Library, setting the stage for a profound discussion on the intertwined paths of Black and Palestinian Liberation. Leading the conversation were notable figures such as Deanna Joseph of the Andrew Joseph III Foundation, Lamia Moukaddam from Central Florida Queers for Palestine, and Kobi Guillory of the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, with Antwan Glover moderating the event. This gathering underscored the importance of solidarity, direct action, and the enduring struggle against political repression and injustice.\nSpeakers delved into the rich history of solidarity between the Black liberation movement and Palestinian liberation efforts. From the Black Panthers' visits to Palestine to Palestinians aiding Ferguson protesters, the shared struggle against oppression was highlighted. The discussion also touched upon the significant impact of the George Floyd uprising and the Al-Aqsa Flood, marking a pivotal moment in both liberation movements. The importance of fighting back against lawmakers and politicians who ignore these struggles was a key theme, with panelist Moukaddam emphasizing the necessity of disrupting the peace of those complicit in oppression.\nCommunity Action and the Path Forward\nThe event also focused on the role of community activism and the importance of standing against systems of oppression. Deanna Joseph shared her personal struggle for accountability after the tragic loss of her son, underscoring the community's role in advocating for change and justice. The discussion highlighted the connection between local issues, such as police brutality, and international struggles, with the Tampa Bay Community Action Committee pointing out the Lakeland Police Department's support for Israel as an example of intertwined systems of oppression.\nThe panel concluded with a powerful call to action, urging attendees to remain active in the streets, support those facing repression, and maintain hope in the collective power of the people's movement. The speakers' messages resonated with the audience, emphasizing the need for direct action, solidarity, and community engagement in the ongoing fight against oppression and for liberation. This event not only highlighted the historical connections between the Black and Palestinian liberation movements but also set a path forward for continued resistance and activism.\nThe Tampa community's gathering serves as a beacon of hope and a reminder of the power of collective action in the face of adversity. It underscores the importance of understanding the interconnectedness of struggles and the necessity of standing united against oppression, regardless of geographical boundaries.",

What's more, the brand caters to various categories of buyers by offering premium models like the OLED TVs and budget-friendly models like the LED TVs. Regardless of whichever model a buyer goes for, Samsung TVs stand out in terms of picture quality, connectivity options, and video upscaling.\nBig-Screen Gaming At A Reasonable Price\nAs advertised, the Samsung DU6950 offers a massive 75-inch screen which is ideal for large living rooms. Nothing screams immersion more than a big-screen TV paired with a powerful gaming console such as the PS5 or Xbox Series X. Imagine the thrill of taking on the overpowered bosses in Black Myth: Wukong or attempting to survive in the ruthless Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2: Heart of Chornobyl on a large TV screen.\nThe DU6950 also sports a 4K resolution, which means on-screen content looks incredibly realistic. For those upgrading from a 1080p TV, the visual upgrade is tremendous and is worth the purchase. What if you're streaming a show that was originally shot in a lower resolution? Viewers won't have to deal with blurry images on the Samsung TV as its Crystal Processor 4K can upscale 720p and 1080p content to a near-4K level.\nRelated\nThe Best Budget Smart TVs in 2024\nSmart TVs are no longer reserved for the elite. Budget shoppers have more choices than ever when it comes to affordable, top of the line smart TVs.\nTVs with excellent motion handling are the top choice for gamers, especially those who play competitive titles such as Marvel Rivals and Apex Legends. Although the DU6950 is capped at a 60 Hz refresh rate, it comes with Motion Xcelerator. Motion Xcelerator is an exclusive Samsung TV feature that lowers the chances of motion blur by enhancing the motion in between frames. Essentially, it makes fast-paced moments in movies and sports games look less blurry.\nWhen you aren't gaming, there are tons of streaming platforms to discover on Samsung TV OS. From Netflix Originals to HBO’s docuseries, there's always one intriguing show or movie to watch. Like other smart TVs, surfing the internet, downloading apps, and updating installed apps is possible from the comfort of your couch.\n75-inch Samsung DU6950 TV\nThe 75-inch Samsung DU5950 is a terrific 4K TV that delivers a big-screen TV experience for gaming and streaming. Aside from its 4K native resolution, the TV's Crystal Processor 4K can upscale content shot in lower resolutions, thereby allowing you to enjoy classics with better details. The TV also has Motion Xcelerator, a feature that improves the motion in between frames, ensuring that fast-paced content is rendered with minimal blur.\nAlthough the TV's audio quality is pretty good, those seeking cinematic-grade entertainment can take things up a notch by pairing a soundbar with the DU6950. Connecting the TV with either a Samsung Q Series or S series soundbar will fill the living room with immersive audio. Whether you're making your way through the story campaign of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 or streaming Yellowstone, expect a richer sound quality from the TV.\nThe Samsung DU6950 is an excellent big-screen TV for console gaming, and it's a great value-for-money product.
