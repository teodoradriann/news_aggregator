    "text": "Adele's highly anticipated concert series in Munich, Germany, has hit a snag as the final dress rehearsal was cancelled due to severe weather conditions, casting doubt on the upcoming shows. Despite intense preparation, including training like an athlete with three to four daily gym sessions, the singer's team made the difficult decision to call off the rehearsal amid fears of thunderstorms and heavy rain. The Adele In Munich concert residency, her second and first European show since 2016, is set to take place throughout August at the purpose-built 80,000-seat Munich Messe stadium, with the final show scheduled for August 31. The bad weather has made her debut public performance tomorrow uncertain. Supporters are holding out hope that the show will proceed as scheduled. The cancellation of the practice was attributed to safety precautions, according to a statement released by the event producers. They were hoping for a later time today to reschedule. They remain uneasy, though, as the German metropolis is expected to have \"moderate, gusty winds from the west to northwest in some areas\" and \"scattered showers or thunderstorms overnight into Saturday, more frequent near the Alps,\" according to projections. The Hello singer has taken a unique approach to connect with her devoted fans at her Munich shows. She requested a custom-built stage that allows her to be closer to the audience, but this means she'll be walking an impressive four to five miles every night on stage. To prepare for this physical demand, Adele has intensified her workout routine, revealing on stage: \"I am back at my gym grind like nobody's business, I am doing two or three sessions a day. My a*e is getting rock solid again! I can move mountains with my bum. I have been working out like a crazy person. The reason that I am working out like I'm an athlete again is because that stage is f*** enormous.\" By pushing herself physically, Adele aims to deliver an unforgettable experience for her fans.

    "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. – A 15-year-old boy will spend the next six years in jail for the death of a teen girl in a fatal stabbing last month in Orange County. Anthony Rushing, 15, pleaded no contest and was sentenced to jail until he is 21, with several conditions such as probation. He received the maximum the law allows in a case like this. The mother of the 16-year-old victim gave an emotional statement to the court. Jasmyne Stringer said the punishment is not enough, telling News 6 the sentence was, “Too lenient. There are too many conditions, too many loopholes and like I said it’s complete BS, it’s a slap in the face.” Kennedy Williams, 16, was killed in the stabbing along South Goldenrod Road, between an Amscot and the Astro Skating Center on March 15. Investigators say an altercation happened after several teens left the skating rink. Another teen was also stabbed but survived. Stringer says the laws need to be changed in Florida because it’s not fair that Rushing will be able to go on with his life when he turns 21.

    "title": "Sacred Mysteries: It’s time to celebrate things too hard to understand",
    "text": "A mosaic of the Sacred Heart at Paray-le-Monial, Burgundy - Bridgeman Some big days in the Church’s year around now expect believers to celebrate teaching that it is hard to begin to grasp. I think that is the right way round: celebrate first and so begin to understand. If you wait until you understand, you’ll never begin to celebrate. The teachings I have in mind are those about God the Trinity, celebrated this year on May 26. Then there is Corpus Christi, the feast honouring the Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity of Jesus Christ present in the Blessed Sacrament. That was held on Thursday May 30, or is commonly held over to the following Sunday, June 2. On Friday June 7 is the feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which may seem not only obscure in doctrine, but also, if the associated art is anything to go by, in rather bad taste. For much of the history of Christianity, the challenge has been to believe that Jesus is God. But just as harmful and more insidious is a failure to believe that he is a man, fully human. A problem here is the use of some technical terms in different senses by opposing factions. I’m not going to attempt to go into it here, but physis, which we translate as “nature” is an example. Unless Jesus is God and man, then mankind has not in him been reconciled to God. The devotion of the Sacred Heart is intended to express the idea that Jesus has loved us with a human heart, in his human nature. The person who does the loving is the eternal Son of God. He assumed human flesh at the Incarnation. But the human flesh he assumed (or took on) was animated by a human soul: it is not that Jesus has a divine person operating his body instead of a human soul doing so. In considering whether Jesus has a separate will (a faculty of choosing and loving), the Church opposed monothelitism (a pious mistake that supposed he had only one will, somehow shared by God and man). But since he has a human soul, Jesus has a human will, as he has a human intellect. This has a consequence of great importance when it comes to considering the effects of his death. “In suffering and death,” the Catechism of the Catholic Church puts it, “his humanity became the free and perfect instrument of his divine love which desires the salvation of men.” His will as God and his will as a man are not an identical thing, but they both have the same intention. Jesus freely accepted his suffering and death. “No one takes it [my life] from me,” he is quoted in the Gospel of St John as saying, “but I lay it down of my own accord.” This is not to deny the injustice of his death. It is the sort of thing an unjust world does to a just person. God’s Son has sovereign freedom: he could do whatever he wanted, and chose to accept death as a sacrifice to atone for the alienating offences of mankind. The mechanics, as it were, of the redemption of mankind by the death and resurrection of Jesus are not easy to express. A formula such as “Jesus died for our sins” is true without saying exactly how that worked. Similarly, the solemn feast of Corpus Christi focuses on the Last Supper, when Jesus took bread and wine and said: “This is my body” and “This cup is the new covenant in my blood”. That institution of the Eucharist, the central act of Christian liturgy, identifies it with the death of Jesus on the cross, made effective as a sacrifice by his acceptance of it. It is also accomplished by God the Trinity: by the decision of the Father and the work of the Holy Spirit, the death of the Son brought life to the world. Speaking about aspects of these mysteries is possible, but they are best explored implicitly in the Eucharist, Sunday by Sunday.
