    "title": "Israeli Tanks Push Into Central Gaza Town; Airstrike Kills 20 in South | Newsmax.com",
    "text": "Thursday, 28 December 2023 05:48 PM EST Israeli tanks thrust deep into a town in the central Gaza Strip on Thursday after days of relentless bombardment that forced tens of thousands of already displaced Palestinian families to flee in a new exodus. A Palestinian journalist posted pictures of Israeli tanks near a mosque in a built-up area of Bureij, the armored contingent having apparently advanced from orchards on the eastern outskirts. Three Palestinians were killed in an Israeli missile strike on a house in northeastern Maghazi camp in central Gaza, health officials said. Further south Israeli forces hit the area around a hospital in the heart of Khan Younis, Gaza's main southern city, where residents feared a new ground push into territory crowded with families made homeless in 12 weeks of an Israel-Hamas war. In one of Israel's latest deadly airstrikes, 20 Palestinians were killed and 55 wounded in Rafah, a major town near the southern border with Egypt, Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said. Their bombed building was housing displaced civilians, according to local medics and residents. Reuters video showed rescuers scrabbling frantically through rubble to uncover and pull out victims including a baby and several children and rushing them through milling crowds of dazed and weeping people to the nearby Kuwaiti Hospital. Palestinian health authorities said earlier that 210 people were confirmed killed in Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours, raising the toll of Palestinians killed in the war so far to 21,320 - nearly 1% of Gaza's population. Thousands more dead were feared to be buried or lost in the ruins. Over the course of the war, the Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but it accuses Hamas of operating in densely populated areas and using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies. GROUND OFFENSIVE INTENSIFIES DESPITE U.S. PLEAS Israel has escalated its ground offensive in Gaza sharply since just before Christmas despite public pleas from its closest ally the United States to scale the campaign down in the closing weeks of the year. It launched the war to destroy the militant Islamist Hamas movement that runs Gaza after fighters rampaged through Israeli towns in a cross-border raid on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages. Of the hostages, 110 were freed during a short truce in late November and another 23 have now been declared dead in absentia, an Israeli government spokesperson said on Thursday. Later on Thursday, U.S. President Joe Biden said American Judith Weinstein, who was believed to have been kidnapped by Hamas, was killed by the Islamist group on Oct. 7. Her husband, Gadi Haggai was killed on the same day, Biden said last week. The Israeli military released findings of an investigation into the killings by its troops in error of three Israeli hostages in Gaza on Dec. 15. Soldiers mistook their cries for help as a ruse by Hamas militants to draw them into an ambush, the military said on Thursday, concluding that the soldiers acted rightly to the best of their understanding. The main focus of fighting is now in central areas south of the wetlands that bisect the narrow coastal strip, where Israeli forces have ordered civilians out over the past several days as their tanks close in. Tens of thousands of people fleeing the densely packed Nusseirat, Bureij and Maghazi districts were heading south or west on Thursday into the already overwhelmed city of Deir al-Balah along the Mediterranean coast, crowding into hastily built camps of makeshift tents. \"Over 150,000 people - young children, women carrying babies, people with disabilities & the elderly - have nowhere to go,\" the main U.N. organization operating in Gaza, UNRWA, said in a social media post. The eastern part of Bureij was a theater of heavy fighting on Thursday morning, with Israeli tanks thrusting in from the north and east, residents and militants said. \"That moment has come, I wished it would never happen, but it seems displacement is a must,\" said Omar, 60, who said he had been forced to move with at least 35 family members. He declined to give his surname for fear of reprisals. Yamen Hamad, living in a school in Deir al-Balah since fleeing from the north, said the people who were newly displaced from Bureij and Nusseirat were setting up tents wherever there was open ground. FIGHTING NEAR HOSPITAL IN KHAN YOUNIS Khan Younis, where Israeli forces advanced this month after a truce collapsed on Dec. 1, also came under heavy bombardment on Thursday morning from warplanes and tanks near al-Amal hospital, west of Israeli positions. The Palestinian Red Crescent, which runs the hospital and has its headquarters nearby, said 10 Palestinians were killed and 12 wounded in one bombardment there, the third strike targeting the area around the hospital in less than an hour. Residents said they believed Israeli forces were trying to provoke a new exodus ahead of a further ground assault. Nearby at Nasser Hospital, the main medical center in Khan Younis and largest still functioning in Gaza, women and children shrieked as the dead and wounded were brought in. A toddler lay motionless on a cot while medics tried to revive him; one doctor nodded \"no,\" signaling the boy was dead. Israel reported three more of its soldiers killed, bringing its toll in the ground campaign to 169. The past week has seen some of its heaviest losses of the war so far. Virtually all of Gaza's 2.3 million residents have been driven from their homes at least once and many several times. Only a handful of hospitals still function. In a statement on Thursday, the Israeli military said it \"regrets the harm caused to uninvolved civilians\" from a Dec. 24 air strike on the Maghazi refugee camp that killed 70 people, according to the Palestinian health ministry. The statement said warplanes struck two targets adjacent to where Hamas militants were operating, and a preliminary inquiry showed further buildings nearby were also hit, \"which likely caused unintended harm to additional uninvolved civilians.\" It added: \"The IDF ... is acting to draw conclusions and learn lessons from this event.\" The Palestinian health ministry denounced the attack as a massacre in a crowded residential square. © 2023 Thomson/Reuters.

    "text": "WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: Governor Gavin Newsom today held a virtual press conference announcing nearly $200 million in new state funds to help move people out of encampments and into housing. Along with this announcement, the Governor also announced new measures that will increase oversight of state homelessness funding to ensure accountability by local jurisdictions. WHAT GOVERNOR NEWSOM SAID: “This new funding will get people out of tents and into housing across California. As the state provides unprecedented resources like this, we also expect accountability. Local governments must ensure this funding is being utilized on the ground.” Governor Newsom announces homeless funding and calls for greater accountability. Click here to watch. The awards, totaling approximately $192 million, are part of the state’s Encampment Resolution Fund (ERF) grants, which are administered by the California Interagency Council on Homelessness (Cal ICH). These grants will support 20 projects in 17 California communities aimed at helping people experiencing homelessness transition from encampments into housing. “These grants show what is possible when the state partners with local communities to put people first and provide them with services to put them on the path to safe, stable housing,” said Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency Secretary Tomiquia Moss, who co-chairs Cal ICH. “This approach focuses on providing the person-centered local solutions that will ensure that unsheltered Californians are connected to the appropriate housing and supportive services they need to achieve long-term stability.” “All 17 communities had strong proposals that will help people transition from encampments and onto pathways to housing,” said Cal ICH Executive Officer Meghan Marshall. “While these grants will be made by our sister Department of Housing and Community Development, Cal ICH looks forward to supporting the success of these communities with technical assistance, grounded in evidence-based practices.” List of jurisdictions receiving funds: The city of Anaheim will receive $3.1 million The city of Chico will receive $2.7 million The city of Fresno will receive $10.9 million The city of Los Banos will receive $11.8 million The city of Oakland will receive $7.2 million The city of Oceanside will receive $11.4 million The city of Ojai will receive $12.7 million The city of San Bernardino will receive $4.6 million The city of Santa Cruz will receive $4 million The Humboldt County Continuum of Care will receive $3.4 million Los Angeles County will receive $51.5 million Marin County will receive an award of $18.2 million Monterey County will receive an award of $11.1 million Nevada County will receive $2.5 million Santa Barbara County will receive $7.9 million San Mateo County will receive $14.1 million The Tehama County Continuum of Care will receive $14.1 million When completed, the projects funded by the awards announced today will provide services and support for nearly 3,600 people of which 2,200 will receive permanent housing. Twelve of the 20 projects are designed to resolve encampments along state rights-of-way. For a detailed list of projects and more information, click here .

    "text": "國際珍奶日你喝了嗎？ 營養師指「這成分」傷心血管\n聽新聞\ntest\n0:00 /0:00\n4月30日是國際珍珠奶茶日，許多店家推出買一送一或特價優惠，香濃的奶茶搭配Q彈的珍珠，喝起來超過癮。台灣桃園長庚醫院營養師陳姿吟表示，珍珠奶茶的三大主角為茶、奶精、珍珠，從營養學的角度來看，一杯600克的珍珠奶茶，不僅脂肪含量高，含糖量更是驚人，一杯下肚熱量超高。\n陳姿吟指出，珍珠是利用樹薯粉或木薯粉製成，另加入黑糖水去蜜出甜味，光是珍珠這個食材就屬於精緻澱粉，再加上精製糖。而奶茶的部分，如果是傳統奶精，主要是植物油、糖和添加劑的混合物，熱量高、營養低。「如果使用鮮奶，還有蛋白質、鈣的營養。」她說，不論是哪一種奶，都會讓人變胖。\n陳姿吟強調，有些人喜歡喝傳統珍珠奶茶，因為加了奶精喝起來順口、溫潤，有「復古」的滋味。主要是奶精的植物性油脂特性，但是反式脂肪酸及高熱量也是特點，長期食用容易造成心血管負擔。再加上高果糖、精緻澱粉，萬惡成分喝下肚會造成肝組織的脂肪堆積、增加三酸甘油酯。\n為什麼空腹喝珍珠奶茶容易有滿足感呢？陳姿吟說，因為含糖飲料空腹飲用容易快速吸收，但是雖然身體快速得到能量，過2、3個小時又餓了，反而打亂進食的節奏，且容易攝入過多熱量，讓血糖飆高、脂肪囤積。\n依國健署「每日飲食中，添加糖攝取量不宜超過總熱量的10%」的建議，一杯600克的珍珠奶茶平均熱量700大卡、含糖量約60克，已經超過一天的糖分攝取總量。陳姿吟提醒，即使選擇不加糖，珍珠、奶精隱藏的糖分也很驚人。\n如果真的嘴饞、想咀嚼加料的手搖飲，陳姿吟建議，選擇麥片穀飲、燕麥奶，「至少這些品項含有膳食纖維、植物性蛋白，減少罪惡感。」她說，若想要進行飲食控制，點選配料時要避開芋圓、珍珠這類的精緻澱粉配料，改選擇愛玉、寒天、蘆薈等熱量較低的配料種類。\n血糖",

    "text": "Executive Director of American Muslims for Palestine (AMP) Osama Abuirshaid said at an April 25, 2024 speech at the George Washington University encampment that protesters will change America forever. He said that Zionism will be a dark moment in history, and the generation of the participants in the encampment will bring this \"disgrace to an end.\" He concluded his speech, saying: \"We will take back America […] You will be the past, we are the future. Assalam Alaykum.\" The video was posted on Osama Abuirshaid's Facebook page. Abuirshaid posted on his Facebook page videos of other speakers at George Washington University on April 25, one of whom was Rafiki Morris, who said in a May 2023 Nakba Day rally in Washington D.C. that the only good Zionist is a dead Zionist and that America is a Zionist country and it must be destroyed. Osama Abuirshaid: \"They know they are going against the force of history. They are trying to destroy you before you succeed in bringing this imperialism to an end, before we bring this poison of Zionism to an end. [...] \"Now, we know what America stands for. We know what these elite colleges stand for. They are only structures in an imperial project. Israel is only another structure in an imperial project. Zionism is no less evil than white supremacy or any sort of supremacy. [...] \"We will stand with our morality and we will maintain our future in terms of our professionalism and in terms of how we are going to change this country forever. They are lying to us about American exceptionalism. [...] \"Zionism will be a dark moment in our history. Any sort of supremacy will be a dark moment in our history. It is you, it is your generation, that will bring this to an end. It is you that will bring this disgrace to an end. [...] \"You don't need to be a Palestinian, or Arab, or a Muslim to stand with justice and to stand with the Palestinians.

    "text": "Biora Therapeutics Achieves Positive Interim Results for Clinical Trial of BT-600, Advancing NaviCap™ Platform Development\nAll pharmacokinetic endpoints were achieved, with a PK profile consistent with drug delivery and absorption in the colon\nAll NaviCap™ devices performed as intended and were well tolerated, with no safety signals observed\nMultiple-ascending dose (MAD) portion of the trial is underway and progressing well\nSAN DIEGO, April 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nBiora Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIOR), the biotech company that is reimagining therapeutic delivery, today shared additional positive interim results from the single-ascending dose (SAD) clinical trial of BT-600, which is a drug-device combination consisting of the orally administered NaviCap™ device that delivers a proprietary liquid formulation of tofacitinib to the colon. BT-600 is being developed for the potential treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). The SAD portion of the phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial tested the tolerability and pharmacokinetics of BT-600 at 5 mg and 10 mg doses of tofacitinib, compared to placebo, in healthy adult participants.\n“We are extremely pleased with the interim trial results, some of which we shared during our recent quarterly call, that demonstrate the NaviCap platform’s unique ability to achieve localized delivery to the colon, with a corresponding reduction in systemic drug exposure,” said Ariella Kelman, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Biora Therapeutics. “Direct delivery of JAK inhibitors to the colon has potential for improved efficacy driven by increased colonic tissue exposure, while reducing toxicity risks related to systemic exposure. We believe this could lead to better outcomes for patients suffering from UC.”\nAccording to the interim clinical data, all pharmacokinetic endpoints were met in all study participants. BT-600 was well tolerated with no serious adverse events. All devices performed as intended, with all participants receiving BT-600 showing systemic drug absorption. Tofacitinib was first detected in plasma at approximately six hours following administration, which is consistent with colonic delivery as opposed to absorption in the upper GI tract. The mean time to reach maximum concentration (Tmax) was 8–10 hours following administration of BT-600, versus 0.5-1.0 hours for conventional oral tofacitinib. Tofacitinib was present in fecal samples of all subjects, further confirming delivery of the drug in the colon.\nColonic delivery of BT-600 was associated with 3–4x lower systemic absorption of tofacitinib, with a maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of 26 ng/mL for BT-600 at the 10 mg dose of tofacitinib, versus 88 ng/mL for conventionally administered oral tofacitinib at a 10 mg dose.\n“Many IBD drugs could benefit from localized delivery—research shows that for JAK inhibitors, integrin inhibitors and TNF inhibitors, higher colon tissue concentrations correlate with better outcomes,” said Adi Mohanty, Chief Executive Officer of Biora Therapeutics. “Our NaviCap platform represents a new therapeutic approach to UC and beyond. We continue to demonstrate that our localized delivery technology can enable higher colon tissue concentrations, without subjecting patients to high systemic drug levels, and results from the SAD portion of our clinical trial further confirm the platform’s capability.”\nHighlights from the interim results can be found\nin the corporate presentation on Biora’s website.\nThe multiple-ascending dose (MAD) portion of the trial, currently underway, will evaluate daily doses of BT-600 for 7 days at 5 mg and 10 mg tofacitinib or placebo. Final results are expected to be available in late Q2 2024.\nPhase 1 Clinical Trial Design\nThe objectives of this phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending dose (SAD/MAD) clinical trial are to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, including effects on colon tissue, of BT-600 when administered orally in healthy adult participants. The study, which is being conducted in the United States, consists of two parts. The first part is comprised of 24 participants receiving a single ascending dose of BT-600 with tofacitinib at 5 mg or 10 mg doses or placebo. The second part is comprised of 24 participants receiving multiple ascending-doses of BT-600 with tofacitinib at 5 mg or 10 mg doses or placebo daily for 7 days. The trial is listed at clinicaltrials.gov (\nNCT06275464).\nAbout the NaviCap™ Targeted Oral Delivery Platform\nBiora's NaviCap targeted oral therapeutics platform utilizes a novel approach that could improve patient outcomes by enabling delivery of therapeutics directly to the site of disease, increasing therapeutic levels in tissue while reducing systemic uptake. For the 1.8 million patients in the United States who suffer from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), existing therapeutics offer less than ideal efficacy, likely because of the challenges with safely achieving sufficient drug levels in the affected tissues. Research has shown that targeted delivery of therapeutics has the potential to improve patient outcomes in IBD.\nThe NaviCap platform uses an ingestible device\ndesigned for targeted delivery of therapeutics to improve treatment of IBD. Once swallowed, Biora’s GItrac™ autolocation technology enables the device to autonomously identify targeted locations in the GI tract and release a therapeutic dose of up to 500µl. Studies in healthy volunteers have demonstrated accurate localization and delivery in a fasted state and demonstrated the device’s ability to function in both fasted and fed states, making it potentially the first ingestible therapeutic delivery device that does not require fasting or other food restriction for use. A device function study in participants with active UC also demonstrated successful device performance in active UC patients.\nAbout Ulcerative Colitis\nUlcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic disease that causes inflammation and damage to the colon. Common symptoms include abdominal pain, increased bowel movements, stool urgency, and rectal bleeding. Despite the availability of advanced treatments for UC, including biologics, immunomodulators, and targeted synthetic small molecules, only about 40% of patients achieve clinical remission in induction trials. Surgical intervention is needed in approximately 20% of UC patients, with up to 10% of patients requiring surgical removal of the colon. About 1.5 million people are affected with UC in the United States alone, and ~40,000 new cases are diagnosed each year.\nAbout Biora Therapeutics\nBiora Therapeutics is reimagining therapeutic delivery. By creating innovative smart pills designed for targeted drug delivery to the GI tract, and systemic, needle-free delivery of biotherapeutics, the company is developing therapies to improve patients’ lives.\nBiora is focused on development of two therapeutics platforms: the clinical-stage\nNaviCap™ targeted oral delivery platform, which is designed to improve outcomes for patients with inflammatory bowel disease through treatment at the site of disease in the gastrointestinal tract, and the preclinical-stage BioJet™ systemic oral delivery platform, which is designed to replace injection for better management of chronic diseases through needle-free, oral delivery of large molecules.\nFor more information, visit\nbioratherapeutics.com or follow the company on\nSafe Harbor Statement or Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties and are based on estimates and assumptions.
