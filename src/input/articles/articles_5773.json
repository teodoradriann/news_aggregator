    "title": "Can the government restore trust in the NHS?",
    "text": "Last month, Wes Streeting used his first speech as health secretary to declare the NHS “broken” and going through “the biggest crisis in its history.” And most of the public would agree: trust in the health service is at a record low. Between 2008 and 2024, the share of Britons who felt the NHS would be there for people when they need it declined from 82 per cent to 66 per cent, according to researchers from King’s College London and Ipsos. Almost one in five (18 per cent) believe that it won’t. The [same study](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/policy-institute/assets/the-nhs-still-there-when-we-need-it.pdf) also found that half the population have decided against seeing an NHS GP about a health condition in the last year—many because they thought they either wouldn’t get an appointment, wouldn’t get through on the phone or would face waiting times that were too long. Of those, 45 per cent say their condition either remained the same or became worse. The points are connected: those who have not sought out GP care are more likely to feel that they can’t rely on the NHS, the researchers found. For Sam van Elk, part of the King’s College London team, this was the most striking finding: “It’s certainly one thing to think that the NHS might not be there when you need it but another to act in line with that fear,” he says. For nearly a decade, the NHS has experienced a [significant slowdown in funding growth](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/insight-and-analysis/long-reads/nhs-long-term-plan-explained), while demand for services has grown rapidly. Hospital waiting lists have lengthened, and satisfaction with NHS care has declined. Trust has broken down with this “broken” system which urgently needs to make big changes. The [Labour party 2024 general election manifesto](https://labour.org.uk/change/) lists a series of measures to “get the NHS back on its feet”, which includes incentivising staff to deliver 40,000 more appointments every week out-of-hours, and pooling resources across hospitals to introduce shared waiting lists. It also includes using spare capacity in specific areas of the independent sector, such as delivering elective surgeries and procedures so patients can be treated more quickly. It is unclear how much capacity the independent sector can contribute and how much this would cost. Nick Krachler, a lecturer in human resource management at King’s Business School and another researcher on the project, argues that the private sector is not a feasible solution for the waiting list issue. “The private sector doesn’t have much capacity that the NHS doesn’t already have,” he says, adding that this is because “much of the private sector's capacity comes from NHS employees (particularly physicians but also specialist nurses) who do extra private work to top up their income.” If the government is to restore NHS standards and people’s trust, it will have a lot of work to do. For Krachler, in addition to meeting hard targets on, for example, reducing waiting times, the government should focus on employees’ psychological and economic wellbeing. The latest NHS [staff survey](https://www.nhsstaffsurveys.com/results/national-results/), conducted in 2023, shows that 30 per cent of staff feel burnt out because of their work, and just 31 per cent are satisfied with their level of pay. By focusing on these areas, along with increased funding for service provision, the government “will likely progress in restoring the service over the next five years,” Krachler says. He adds that this must be done without demanding staff productivity increases in return. Last week, Rachel Reeves confirmed a 5.5 per cent pay rise for NHS workers and the BMA recently offered junior doctors a 22.3 per cent average pay increase over two years to avoid widespread strikes which have caused disruption to the NHS for the last two years. If there is increased pay for workers, and the healthcare provision improves as a result, as Krachler hopes it will, trust may bounce back. If the government were to secure a second term and continues to work on sustainably improving NHS employee wellbeing and capacity, Krachler says, “it can restore the service close to what it was before the Conservative-led governments.” “People trust processes as much as outcomes” adds van Elk, who believes that demonstrable improvement in services, even if they aren’t restored entirely to pre-austerity levels, “could do a great deal to restore trust.”",

    "text": "Alertada por la alarma de un departamento, una vecina llamó al 911 y frustró un [robo](https://www.losandes.com.ar/temas/robos/) millonario a una financiera del microcentro porteño. La banda estaba compuesta por cuatro personas. Los dos hermanos y otros dos jóvenes que llegaron al edificio de Reconquista al 600 con el objetivo de llevarse una importante cantidad de dinero. El lugar estaba marcado, el departamento B del piso 13, a nombre de una empresa. Una vez adentro llenaron tres mochilas con miles de dólares y otras monedas. Según informó Clarín, se llevaron 216.664 dólares, 7.420 euros, 6.322.800 pesos argentinos, 25.000 reales, 890 pesos uruguayos y varios cheques. Todo estaba saliendo de acuerdo al plan original, pero hubo un factor que no tuvieron en cuenta. Una vecina alertó al encargado del edificio sobre el sonido de una alarma activada en el piso 13. Minutos después, agentes de la Comisaría Vecinal 1D de la Policía de la Ciudad llegaron alrededor de las 13.40. El personal de seguridad privada, ya los habían detectado, pero los ladrones escaparon por las escaleras. La Policía revisó piso por piso y encontró a dos de los asaltantes en el quinto piso y a los otros en el octavo. Dos estaban armados y los otros dos llevaban el dinero. Uno de los ladrones estacionó en el bunker de Javier Milei Gustavo Javier Collares (27) fue detenido en el piso octavo. Su hermano menor, Marcos Nahuel Collares (23), en el quinto. Además, estaban Cristian Alejandro Coman (25) y Francisco Nicolás Sosa (25). Todos con domicilio en Dock Sud, partido de Avellaneda y vinculados en redes sociales. Uno de los datos más curiosos del caso fue que Javier Collares usó su propio auto para llegar hasta la escena. Y estacionó en el Hotel Libertador, en avenida Córdoba 690, donde había otras ocho mochilas escondidas. Se trata del hotel donde se hospeda, desde el 23 de octubre, el presidente Javier Milei.",

    "text": "Talk about luck! Two people are recovering after rainy conditions in California led to an accident. According to NBC Bay Area , the San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD) rescued the injured after their car flipped and slid down an embankment. The incident reportedly happened on Wednesday (Dec. 27), with a 911 call logged at 2:45 p.m. local time. A hiker near the accident area — Glen Canyon Park — told officials he had witnessed the navy blue sedan sliding down the hill. Firefighters later assessed that the car had skidded over 100 feet down the embankment. To rescue the driver and passenger, fire officials organized and executed a technical rescue. That process involved clearing thick brush leading to the damaged car and using ropes. Police reportedly shut down one lane of O’Shaughnessy Boulevard to carry out the rescue operation. Police are still investigating the car crash on the embankment. However, the local fire department told NBC Bay Area that things went left after the driver reportedly hit the curb. After the impact, the car rolled once and slid down the steep hill. Thankfully, the driver and passenger — whose connection remains unclear — sustained minor injuries. They were transported to a local hospital for additional evaluation following the incident. Fire officials have not released the identities of the injured. PEOPLE reports that rainy conditions in the area contributed to the embankment car accident. According to the National Weather Service, rain poured on the Bay Area between early Wednesday (before the crash) and finally tapered off early Thursday. Another storm is reportedly expected on Friday (Dec. 29). Meanwhile, the San Francisco PD is still investigating the case. Check out the thread below for SFFD’s photo and video of the rescue efforts.

    "text": "Amy Carr’s eczema can sometimes take over all aspects of her life – her work, her relationship and even her ability to go outside. (ABC News: Lottie Twyford)\nIt’s often dismissed as just a rash, but for Amy Carr, eczema is a painful, expensive condition which controls what she can and can’t do with her life.\nFrom her daily routine to when she can have a child, 31-year-old Ms Carr is used to having to plan her life around her condition.\nOn a daily basis, it’s a case of showering, creaming up and letting it soak in before getting dressed.\nBut when her eczema flares up, her evening routine alone blows out to about two hours.\n“It involves having a bath, whether it’s a bleach bath soak, or just a water bath, [I] soak for 20 to 30 minutes,” Ms Carr said.\n“And then I have to get out of that, put on two to three layers of cream, wrap myself with wet towels and wrap that up with bandages or something similar before putting pyjamas on.”\nFlare-ups managed with lengthy full-body bandage wrapping That process of wrapping her entire body can’t be done alone, so Ms Carr is grateful for her partner’s help – and the occasional phone call.\n“Usually, [that’s] to my mum while I’m crying, even at 31,” she said.\nWhen it gets really bad, Ms Carr must stay home and repeat that process two or three times a day.\nManaging eczema is all about getting as much moisture in as possible which means sufferers need to keep changing creams as the skin becomes accustomed to each one.\nMs Carr describes it as an exhausting process.\n“When I get quite upset about it, then I get migraines from that as well,” she said.\n“So then it’s almost like I’ve recovered from the eczema and then I need a day or two to recover from the backlash of dealing with that eczema.”\nEczema costs at least $15,000 a year to manage Treating eczema is an expensive undertaking.\n“I’ve worked out on a very rough calculation that we would be spending over $15,000 a year,” Ms Carr said.\nThat’s a combination of not only dermatologist and doctor visits, medications, bandages and creams but all the flow-on impacts, too.\n“[The cream] destroys your sheets, it destroys your towels, it destroys your clothing,” she explained.\nThere are the costs of keeping the house cool and air-conditioned as the heat exacerbates her eczema, the cost of replacing carpets with wooden floors as carpet stores dust mites and pollen.\nThere is also the cost of water bills for all the baths she must take and buying more expensive, natural cleaning products to avoid harsh chemicals.\nCondition takes an emotional toll, too Ms Carr said the thought of where those thousands of dollars could be going does weigh heavy on her mind on the nights where she can’t sleep.\nNot that it’s all about money.\nSome of the medication Ms Carr is on – or has been on previously – means she cannot fall pregnant while taking it or she will have to terminate the pregnancy.\n“It affects relationships, it [will] affect the next part of mine or my partner’s relationship of starting a family and all that kind of stuff,” she said.\n“I hate that part.”\nEczema controls schedule and affects mental health Sometimes, it means she must cancel events or plans if the weather changes. Sometimes, she can’t go to work or do her usual errands.\nShe describes this as the biggest mental hurdle.\n“I can’t just decide at eight o’clock in the morning, I’m going to do something at 10 o’clock because if my skin’s really bad, then I can’t go anywhere,” Ms Carr said.\nFor the most part, though, she feels lucky to have a supportive network around her – her partner, friends and family who all understand and accept her for who she is.\nFor Ms Carr, one of the most important things is having her mum and friends ready to answer her phone calls and friends who drop round meals and coffee when she’s stuck at home.\n“Just sitting here while I have a cry just makes that much easier,” she said.\nHer colleagues and the kids she teaches are also incredibly supportive and help her on days when she needs it – something else she says “makes a world of difference”.\nHot, dry weather and pollen to exacerbate condition Ms Carr’s eczema is exacerbated by many things including stress and diet.\nBut heat and pollen are two major factors which cause flare-ups for her – both of which are predicted to stay for the next few months.\nMs Carr has already started the “mental preparation” needed to get herself ready for the heat of summer.\nShe’s purchased extra bandages, creams and ice packs and will be able to set a timer on the air conditioner to ensure the house is as cool as possible.\nBut she knows that — for some of the summer at least — she’ll be stuck inside.\nEveryone’s eczema unique: dermatologist Eczema Support Australia reports three million people across the country live with eczema.\nDermatologist Dr Diana Rubel said the condition — which is also known as atopic dermatitis — is a common complaint among her patients.\nBut despite this, there’s a lot that is unknown about it.\n“The skin is an organ that acts like your senses … so we think eczema is an over-reading of the environment,” she explained.\n“So the skin overreacts to everyday things like heat, temperature changes, friction, sweat, stress, environmental changes and irritants.\n“We think it’s a genetic condition you’re born with … but then the environment brings it out.”\nShe said there are things that can be done to treat eczema, but the place to start is to recognise what causes flare-ups, because it’s different for everyone.\nHer tips for surviving summer include keeping skin well-moisturised, not over-showering and using sunscreens designed for sensitive skin.\nDr Rubel says there are three stages to managing the condition.\nFirst, by avoiding things with harsh chemicals which make it worse. The second is to find a moisturiser which works and use it every day.\nAnd lastly, to add medication — whether that’s a topical ointment, tablets or injections.\nBurden of disease needs to be measured Why exactly people get it and what the burden of disease is for sufferers are two questions Dr Rubel would like to know the answer to.\nShe said experiences like Ms Carr’s — where eczema affects all parts of your life, including your mental health — are common.\n“When we look after patients, we’re very aware of how frustrated, depressed, sleep-deprived, ashamed … all those feelings come out,” she said.\n“We need to acknowledge that’s part of the disease.”\nDr Rubel says there can be a cumulative impact over the course of a patient’s life where eczema means the sufferer must miss out on one thing, which then prevents them from doing the next one.\n“You miss out on going an an excursion because you had bad eczema and that could have really piqued your interest or got your career going in that direction,” she said.\nNot being able to go into certain careers or start a family at specific times, like Ms Carr, could also be “devastating”, Dr Rubel said.\nCalls for national approach to tackling eczema Melanie Funk, who launched national charity Eczema Support Australia after her family’s own experience with it, has called for more attention for the condition and a national strategy.\nAs part of this, she says she would like to see more coordinated care between GPs, dermatologists and pharmacists to improve treatment and outcomes for patients.\n“I think it is really a perception issue … and that it need to be taken more seriously,” Ms Funk said.\n“Eczema has been around for a long, long time. It is not a new thing. What is new, is that we’re understanding that need for coordinated care and that strategy so regardless of where you live in Australia, you’re getting high-quality care.”\nFor Ms Carr, though, it’s all about acceptance and understanding.\n“It’s about being inclusive and accepting and knowing that it’s more than just a rash or more than just spots all over my body,” she said.",

    "text": "You'd be hard-pressed to find a better example of a team lacking self-awareness in training camp more than the Las Vegas Raiders on Thursday. The team passed around a Kermit the Frog puppet dressed as Patrick Mahomes, mocking the Kansas City Chiefs' quarterback that has won more playoff games in their stadium than they have. This Raiders Kermit Mahomes doll is going to age abysmally— The 33rd Team (@The33rdTeamFB) [pic.twitter.com/Z4p5GNCgZL] [July 25, 2024] Mahomes is 10-2 against the Raiders in his career, and has never lost to the Raiders in Oakland/Las Vegas. In those 12 games, he's thrown 30 touchdowns to just four interceptions and has a passer rating of 109.6. The Chiefs haven't won less than 10 games since 2014. Meanwhile, the Raiders have one winning season since 2016. The Raiders beating the Chiefs on Christmas day last year was their Super Bowl. The Chiefs' Super Bowl was winning the actual Super Bowl for the third time in the Mahomes era in the Raiders' building. The point is why poke the bear if you're the Raiders? Why would you give Mahomes any extra motivation to embarrass you twice a year?",
