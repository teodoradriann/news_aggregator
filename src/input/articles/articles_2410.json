    "text": "CNN — Guns swinging from their hips, two soldiers in black combat boots and green tactical clothing appear to wire explosives to pumps at the Canada Water reservoir in Rafah, southern Gaza.\nMoments later, an orange blaze tears through the critical facility in the Tal al-Sultan neighborhood, as ribbons of grey smoke erupt into the sky.\nThe blast was captured in a now deleted video , which was reportedly shared by an Israeli soldier on Instagram and geolocated by CNN. Satellite imagery shows that the reservoir was damaged between July 26 and July 27. Destroyed buildings are visible in the surrounding area.\nThe reservoir could hold 3 million liters of water and was central to the treatment and distribution of water in the Rafah Governate, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), providing water for 150,000 people prior to October 7, when the war began.\nWhen asked about the incident captured on camera, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told CNN that its troops had been operating in the Tal al-Sultan area for several weeks to “dismantle terrorist infrastructures and eliminate terrorists, whilst taking feasible measures in order to mitigate damage to civilian structures.”\nIt added that it examines reports of videos posted to social media and handles them with disciplinary measures. The IDF said the incident was under review by the Fact Finding and Assessment Mechanism, “an independent investigative mechanism outside the chain of command entrusted with investigating exceptional events in warfare.”\nMaxar Technologies\nMaxar Technologies Satellite images show Canada Water reservoir in Rafah, southern Gaza, on July 18 (left) and July 30 (right). ©2024 Maxar Technologies There have been many water facilities damaged or destroyed by Israel’s 10-month-long assault in Gaza, according to the UN and various other international bodies, compounding the civilian population’s suffering, risking the spread of disease and leading human rights experts to accuse Israel of using water supply as a weapon .\nThe destruction of the Canada Water reservoir “is certainly a breach of international humanitarian law (IHL),” Mark Zeitoun, director general of the Geneva Water Hub, a Swiss institute specializing in hydro-diplomacy, told CNN.\n“IHL is meant to protect against indiscriminate attacks on the civilian population or the objects they depend upon (for) survival,” he said.\nEven before the controlled explosion in late July, the Israeli siege drained fuel and electricity supplies needed to power the Canada Water reservoir and other water systems in the city, according to Rafah’s mayor, Ahmed Al-Sofi, causing severe shortages.\n“Rafah was already suffering from water shortages,” Al-Sofi told CNN in July. “The city of Rafah is a city struck by destruction, hunger and thirst.”\nThe amount of water available in Gaza works out at 4.74 liters of water (1 gallon) per person per day, Oxfam reported in July, adding that this is “just under a third of the recommended minimum in emergencies and less than a single toilet flush.” The international nonprofit has accused Israel of using water as a “weapon of war,” saying Palestinians in Gaza have “almost no water to drink, let alone to bathe, cook, or clean.”\nExtreme summer heat in Gaza is making a desperate shortage of water even worse for Palestinians already stalked by famine and struggling with repeated displacement.\nThis June was the hottest on record in Israel, according to the Israel Meteorological Service. Temperatures in Negba, a few miles north of Gaza, reached 39.4 C (103F) in the middle of the month, according to CNN meteorologists.\nIsrael’s war in Gaza has reduced supplies of fuel, chlorine and spare parts, stifling water production, purification and sewage pumping, according to the UN. Around 70% of all water and sanitation facilities in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged, the WASH Cluster, a United Nations-led group that coordinates humanitarian efforts for water, sanitation and hygiene, said on July 24, citing satellite analysis from the UN Satellite Centre.\nPalestinian children cool off and fill up water jugs in the Nuseirat refugee camp, in central Gaza, amid a heatwave on June 9, a day after a deadly operation by Israeli forces to rescue hostages. Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/Getty Images COGAT, the Israeli agency responsible for approving aid into Gaza, told CNN in a statement that Israel allows and facilitates the “unlimited entry” of water tanks and fuel supplies into Gaza. It added that there has been a “continual effort” since the start of the war to facilitate the repair and extension of water wells, desalination facilities and water mains.\nBut several Palestinians told CNN they are forced to make hazardous journeys in search of water, risking exposure to Israeli attacks. Two people told CNN they had witnessed physical violence and even killing at public distribution points as people fight for scant resources. Those displaced to makeshift camps described scenes of sewage spilling into the streets and children drinking from puddles.\nMore than 1.7 million cases of infectious diseases have been recorded in Gaza, according to the Ministry of Health there. Traces of the highly infectious polio virus – transmitted through faeces, and contaminated water or food – were found in a 10-month-old child in the central Gazan city of Deir al-Balah earlier this month. The child was later paralyzed due to the disease, the UN said on August 23.\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) testing discovered the virus in sewage samples in Gaza in July, putting thousands of Palestinians at risk of contracting a disease that can cause paralysis.\nAfter the Gaza Ministry of Health declared a polio epidemic last month, the WHO warned that ongoing Israeli bombardment had stifled vaccination efforts in Gaza . They are now calling for a halt to the fighting to allow for an effective vaccination drive.\nWidower Alaa Riyad says he treks many miles every day under the glare of the sun to collect water for his family, in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza.\nThe 42-year-old told CNN that he became “father and mother” to his children after his wife and 18 other relatives were killed by Israeli bombardment several months ago.\n“We have found worms in the water more than once,” he told CNN. “What can we do?… There is no life for us.”\nIsraeli attacks in the strip have killed more than 40,200 Palestinians and injured about 93,000 since the war started, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. The Israeli military launched its aerial and ground assault in Gaza after the militant group Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and abducting more than 250, according to Israeli authorities.\n‘Near complete destruction of all water infrastructure’ Gaza’s water crisis has been building for decades. In 2017, the UN’s children’s agency, UNICEF, said that 95% of water from Gaza’s sole aquifer was “unfit for human consumption,” due to over-extraction, seawater infiltration and sewage contamination.\nIn 2021, about 90% of Gaza’s water came from groundwater wells drawing water from that aquifer, according to the Palestinian Water Authority. The remaining 10% came mostly from desalination plants and Israel’s national water company, Mekorot, via three pipelines.\nBut since early summer, Gaza’s municipal wells and desalination plants (two out of three of which are functioning) have operated at an average of around 15% and 22% capacity, respectively, according to CNN analysis of WASH Cluster data.\nWim Zwijnenburg, who investigates the environmental impact of conflicts for the Dutch peace organization PAX, told CNN the level of damage done to Gaza’s water systems is “the most severe we’ve seen so far in any conflict in the last 10 years, probably even longer.”\n“What we’re seeing so far… is the near-complete destruction of all water infrastructure, which includes water pumping stations, water wells, the whole piping system in Gaza,” Zwijnenburg said. “The few functioning pumps that are still operating, the quality of the water is so bad… (But) people have no choice but to drink it.”\nWithin the first week of the war, Saaed Al-Madhoun, an emergency response manager for the humanitarian agency CARE International, was forced to flee an Israeli incursion with his family near their home in Gaza City, which was later flattened by bombardment.\nThe aid worker is haunted by “constant fear and uncertainty,” as the threat of Israeli attacks loom over his wife and five children, aged between 1 and 13 years old. They are displaced in miserable conditions in Deir al-Balah, where the entire family survives on just 20 liters of water per day – less than the minimum of 3 liters per person needed for survival, according to UNICEF .\n“Most of the water we access is not potable… it often has a salty or metallic taste,” he said in testimony relayed to CNN by CARE International. “I have seen children drinking from puddles.”\n‘Completely miserable’ conditions in tent camps Barbed wire and concrete slabs sink into huge pools of green, sewage-contaminated water in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. Footage filmed by a journalist working for CNN shows residents tiptoeing through streams of muddy water pouring through the once-vibrant neighborhood.\nThe Israeli offensive has displaced up to 1.9 million people – nearly the entire population – in Gaza, according to the UN . People in sprawling tent camps say they can barely access potable water or sanitation facilities in areas polluted by raw sewage and teeming with bugs . Women endure several menstrual cycles without washing, according to the UN . Others queue in the heat to use toilets at overwhelmed hospitals – or risk being chased by dogs to use washrooms in the middle of the night. The UN previously recorded one improvised shelter with only 25 toilets for 14,000 people inside and 59,000 outside.\nPalestinians told CNN they must prioritize scarce water supplies for consumption instead of bathing, washing clothes or cleaning dishes. Parents told CNN they struggle to find enough gas or fuel to boil and sterilize water, increasing the risk of illness. Some give their children food that requires minimal water for preparation – but offers poor nutritional value. Others describe water contaminated during transportation in unclean tanks.\nChildren walk through pools of green, sewage-contaminated water in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. CNN Mohammed Hamouda, a health worker displaced in Deir al-Balah, told CNN he and his family, including his three young children, have suffered from diarrhea and abdominal cramps due to consumption of dirty water.\n“We get the water supposedly clean and drinkable,” he said. “But gastrointestinal diseases and intestinal diseases occur… We do not know that it is unclean until after we use it,” he said.\n“Obtaining clean water is difficult. Getting water for bathing is more difficult. Finding a toilet to relieve oneself is also very difficult.”\nMuslims cannot find enough water to make ablution before prayer, a necessity for those seeking moments of relief through faith .\nChildren suffer from skin rashes, expectant mothers face stillbirth risk Asma struggles to distract her children from the stinging pain of blisters and itchiness of head lice. The Palestinian mother is staying with seven relatives in Deir al-Balah, where insects crawl between the folds of their tent.\n“In the tents we have… an unimaginable quantity of insects, pincher bugs and cockroaches,” she said, in an account relayed to CNN by CARE International. “We get tired trying to cool and fan ourselves.” Asma’s last name has been withheld by CARE International to protect her identity.\n“My children are sick, and we can’t even find medical treatment,” she added. “We have no shampoo, or detergent to wash our clothes… What are we supposed to do?”\nA Palestinian girl is diagnosed with a skin infection in Gaza, on July 26. Health workers say children are catching skin infections due to contaminated water and a lack of access to sanitation facilities. Dawoud Abo Alkas/Anadolu/Getty Images Chronic water shortages will compound “all the existing fragility” among the population, according to Tanya Haj-Hassan, a pediatric intensive care doctor working with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders, especially for the most vulnerable.\nThe stress of war paired with water shortages increases the risk of stillbirth , pre-term delivery and blood clots for pregnant women in Gaza , Haj-Hassan said. Breastfeeding women are less likely to produce enough milk for newborns, potentially causing malnourishment. Those who can access sparse supplies of powdered infant formula may not find clean water to make up bottles, compounding the risk of illness, Haj-Hassan added.\nSustained restrictions on aid Israel’s COGAT told CNN they have facilitated the entry of 48,670 tons of water aid into Gaza since the war began, adding that they have provided 14 forklift trucks to assist with aid collection at the Kerem Shalom border crossing between Gaza and Israel, as well as broadening supply routes and increasing operating hours for aid collection.\nBut relief workers say what’s coming in is not nearly enough to respond to soaring needs, blaming Israel for sustained aid restrictions, blocked access to parts of the north , destruction of roads and attacks on relief convoys . Humanitarian workers and government officials told CNN in March that Israeli officials were repeatedly rejecting much needed aid, including water purification tablets and filtration systems, at entry points to Gaza. COGAT described the testimony given to CNN at the time as “false accusations.”\nSham Abu Tabaq, age five, saw her father and sister shot dead in front of her. CNN Related article She says Israeli military killed her husband and daughter. Then soldiers brought her to an Israeli hospital\nLiz Allcock, head of protection at the UK-based NGO Medical Aid for Palestinians, told CNN she saw “thousands and thousands” of bottles of water sitting at the Kerem Shalom border crossing on July 3.\nSeveral Palestinians told CNN that scarcity, the risks involved in transporting water, and fuel shortages had driven up the cost of water to unaffordable levels. Some say the absence of regulation means water supplied by aid agencies is sold on the black market for an inflated cost.\nIn some areas, water has risen from $7 for 1,000 liters (about 264 gallons) to $45 to $50, Haj-Hassan said. Hamouda, the father-of-three displaced in Deir al-Balah, said the daily cost of water for him and his family has risen from one-third of a dollar in October to $2.\nRaed Radwan, a father displaced to a tent in Deir al-Balah told CNN that he was constantly worried about keeping his family cool and hydrated. His five-month-old daughter recently suffered heatstroke, and he had no cold water to give her.\n“For nine months, we have been enduring the ongoing water crisis… I hope there will be a solution to the water problem because I can no longer handle it. I am mentally and physically exhausted,” he said in July.\nCNN’s Gianluca Mezzofiore, Abeer Salman, Tareq El Helou, Ibrahim Dahman and Lauren Izso contributed reporting.",

    "title": "Catholic group calls for state investigation of transgender activists at funeral in New York cathedral - LifeSite",
    "text": "NEW YORK ( LifeSiteNews ) — CatholicVote president Brian Burch requested New York Attorney General Letitia James and New York County District Attorney Alvin Bragg to open an investigation of the transgender activists who deceived and desecrated the iconic St. Patrick’s Cathedral during last week’s funeral for a transgender atheist . On February 15, transgender activist and prostitute “Cecilia Gentili,” a man who “identified” as a woman, was celebrated at St. Patrick’s by hundreds of people dressed in scandalous clothing. Burch argued that the activists committed a hate crime with their open mockery of the Catholic faith within America’s most important Catholic cathedral and committed criminal trespass by obtaining access to the cathedral for the funeral through intentional deception, both in violation of current New York law. “According to both media reports and video footage readily available online, activists admit to withholding from cathedral administrators the full intent and purpose of their gathering,” Burch wrote. “Indeed, the Archdiocese of New York has publicly affirmed that they ‘had no idea our welcome and prayer would be degraded in such a sacrilegious and deceptive way.’ The deception employed to gain access to St. Patrick’s Cathedral in order to hold a ceremony that profaned that holy place and mocked the Catholic religion cries out for justice.” READ: Cardinal Dolan says Harrison Butker sent him letter condemning ‘transgender funeral’ at St. Patrick’s Citing New York’s Penal Law Sec. 485.05.1(a), and Penal Law Sec. 485.3., Burch noted that “under New York’s hate crimes law, selecting the victim of a criminal trespass based on a religion or religious practice is a hate crime.” “New York’s courts have recognized that those who gain access to property by deception are liable for criminal trespass. People v. Segal, 78 Misc.2d 955 (1974),” he continued. “The outrageous sacrilege perpetrated at St. Patrick’s Cathedral is indeed a hate crime. Video footage shows that transgender activists intentionally used deception to obtain permission to enter St. Patrick’s and the facts show that access was used to desecrate that sacred space and mock Catholic faith and morals. Again, the pastor of St. Patrick’s has confirmed that they were not told the nature and purpose of the offensive stunt that was planned,” Burch wrote. READ: Faithful Catholics urge bishops to stop Fiducia Supplicans in light of St. Patrick’s Cathedral scandal Voicing the outrage of Catholics in New York and throughout the country, Burch told James to bring to justice the “trans” activists who made mockery of the Catholic faith so vilely. “We urge you to act quickly and resolutely to address this grave injustice, the very sort of vicious abuse that New York’s Hate Crimes Act was designed to prevent,” he said. “On behalf of millions of Catholics nationwide, we are asking for your help to vindicate the rights and dignity of Catholic New Yorkers, and indeed, the countless Catholics throughout this nation who regard St. Patrick’s as one of their most revered holy places.” “I urge you to defend the rights and dignity of Catholic New Yorkers and the tens of thousands of Catholics from throughout this great nation who visit St. Patrick’s to honor the saint and practice their faith each year.” READ: Catholics to hold Rosary rally at St. Patrick’s Cathedral after scandalous ‘transgender funeral’ Members of Tradition, Family and Property (TFP) are organizing a Rosary rally to make reparation for the sacrilegious pro-LGBT funeral. “Mocking everything sacred, the service looked like a Drag Queen Show, applauding sin, ridiculing the Church, and defiling the house of God,” a TFP flyer for the event said. A LifeSite petition launched in response to the event, which organizers have called a political protest, is urging Cardinal Timothy Dolan to exorcise the cathedral. As of the publication of this article, more than 14,000 people have added their signatures to the petition, which can be signed here .",

    "text": "[Mónica Lizette Castellanos Osorio ](/autores/monica-lizette-castellanos-osorio) Primer fenómeno astronómico en 2024: ¿cuándo y cómo verlo en Colombia? En el 2024 se tendrán varios eventos astronómicos para que las personas los puedan ver. Las Cuadrántidas son una lluvia de meteoros que ocurre entre el 1 y el 5 de enero, con su pico máximo de actividad el 3 o 4 de enero. Es la primera lluvia de meteoros del año en el hemisferio norte y es visible entre el 28 de diciembre y el 12 de enero. El radiante de las Cuadrántidas se encuentra al norte de la constelación de Bootes cerca de la cola de la Osa Mayor. Esta lluvia de meteoros puede tener una tasa de actividad por encima de los 120 meteoros por hora, lo que la convierte en una de las lluvias más activas del año junto a las Perseidas de agosto y las Gemínidas de diciembre. Le puede interesar: [Mini agujeros negros pueden estar devorando estrellas](https://www.lafm.com.co/tecnologia/mini-agujeros-negros-pueden-estar-devorando-estrellas) Sin embargo, los meteoros no se ven tan a menudo como los meteoros de las otras dos lluvias debido a que su periodo de máxima actividad suele durar tan solo unas pocas horas y a las malas condiciones meteorológicas. En 2024, la observación de esta lluvia de estrellas se verá dificultada por dos factores, aparte de las posibles condiciones meteorológicas. Para observar las Cuadrántidas conviene localizar la constelación del Boyero, que se sitúa cerca de la Osa Mayor.

    "title": "Science for Living: Nicotine pouch use rising among teens; public health expert sounds alarm",
    "text": "Oral nicotine pouches—small, smokeless, nearly invisible and placed between the lip and gum—are rapidly gaining popularity among teens, sparking new concerns from public health experts.\n“Nicotine pouches are really discreet and easy to use. Young people use them without parents and teachers noticing,” said Elise Stevens, PhD, assistant professor of population & quantitative health sciences and director of the Center for Tobacco Treatment Research and Training at UMass Chan Medical School. “That’s part of what makes them so dangerous.”\nWhat are the numbers showing?\nAlthough oral nicotine pouches have been on the market since 2016, sales have surged dramatically in recent years. In 2016, approximately 100,000 units were sold. By 2020, that number soared to 46 million. The top-selling brands, Zyn, On!, Rogue and Velo, are owned by big tobacco companies.\nMuch like e-cigarettes, nicotine pouches have benefited from strategic marketing on social media platforms. Influencers, who often have large followings on social media, are promoting the products, sometimes without disclosing that they are being paid to do so. Early research shows that teens may trust and like the products more as a result of seeing them on social media, even when it is disclosed that the social media posts are paid advertising.\n“We’re trying to understand why disclosure doesn’t deter interest,” said Dr. Stevens. “It might be that teens see honesty as a form of trustworthiness. But either way, it’s making our job—to protect and inform young people—harder.”\nWhat worries experts the most?\nBeyond the rise in popularity, there’s concern over how early use of nicotine pouches may lead to addiction and even riskier behaviors.\n“There’s evidence that using one nicotine product makes you more likely to try others or at least view other nicotine and tobacco products as less harmful,” Stevens said. “Even if a teen switches from vaping to pouches, they’re still on a trajectory that could lead to smoking or other substance use.”\nWhile pouches may carry fewer health risks than cigarettes or vapes, they are not harmless, especially for developing brains. Studies point to concerns over cognitive effects, memory disruption, cardiovascular disease, and oral and neurological problems.\nWhat’s drawing teens in?\nTeens say they like being able to conceal using the nicotine pouches since they place them under the lip. They also cite stress relief, peer influence and savvy marketing for what’s making the pouches more popular. With adolescent mental health struggles on the rise, many teens turn to nicotine as a coping tool, she said.\n“We have a mental health epidemic among young people,” said Stevens. “And unfortunately, substances like nicotine become a way for teens to cope.”\nIn Massachusetts, flavored nicotine sales are banned from retail stores. Yet teens are finding creative ways to access flavored pouches: via older siblings, social media sales networks or across state lines.\n“Some kids are buying from older siblings or strangers online and we’re still trying to track exactly how widespread that is.”\nWhy is it so difficult to regulate?\nRegulating nicotine pouches poses challenges, especially online. Social platforms are flooded with unmonitored promotional content, often fueled by complex influencer-marketing deals.\n“We’re seeing health misinformation explode online,” said Stevens. “Much of the health content teens encounter on social media platforms is inaccurate and they’re using it to make real decisions.”\nAdditionally, the nicotine in these products is synthetic, which makes it harder to regulate within existing industry standards.\nWhat can parents and educators do?\nBecause nicotine pouches are so easy to conceal, they often go unnoticed. Teachers and parents may only spot subtle signs like lip bulges or mild nausea. Relying on honest conversation and asking questions could be helpful.\n“Have open, nonjudgmental conversations. Kids are more likely to talk if they don’t feel punished. Education and support are key.”\nWhat can help educate teens on this?\nThis rise in nicotine-pouch use highlights a deeper disconnect: the gap between public health messaging and actual teen behavior. Experts emphasize the need to meet youth where they are, especially online, with relatable stories and nuanced information.\n“Teens are pretty savvy,” Stevens reminds. “But even the smartest of us can get duped by an influencer. I’ve bought things from Instagram, too. That’s how powerful this stuff is.”\nRelated media:\nBoston Globe: Are nicotine pouches like Zyn healthier than cigarettes? Here’s what you need to know.",

    "text": "It’s that time of the year again.\nCities across San Diego County are finalizing their budgets for the fiscal year that begins in July. That’s been an especially burdensome process for some cities.\nEnter Escondido, which has been struggling with an ongoing structural budget deficit and has been relying on one-time funding sources and temporary solutions to close budget gaps in the past few years.\nThat’s still the case for the upcoming fiscal year.\nThe City Council discussed the preliminary budget a couple weeks ago, and city staff presented a similar outlook to previous years. The city has to, once again, use one-time funding sources to close this year’s gap. Those sources are quickly running out.\nThe Budget\nEscondido staff is projecting an average deficit of $18.2 million each year over the next 20 years. For the upcoming fiscal year, the city expects to use one-time funding sources and cost-reduction methods to close its budget gap.\nThe city will likely use around $4.8 million in Covid relief funds from the American Rescue Plan Act, which city leaders have tapped in previous years, to cover management contracts with the Escondido Public Library and the California Center for the Arts.\nCity staff said those Covid funds must be fully allocated by the end of 2024 and will no longer be a source of revenue for the city moving forward.\nAnother saving grace this year will come from the elimination of 10 full-time vacant positions, which reduced the budget by almost $1 million.\nCity leaders will also pull around $2.5 million from the city’s workers compensation fund to replace 39 police vehicles.\nThat money would typically come from the city’s Fleet Services Fund used to maintain, fuel and replace all city vehicles. The fund once included a pot of money for future vehicle purchases to regularly replace aging vehicles and equipment, but the city emptied it to close past budget gaps.\nThis is the first year since 2021 that the city didn’t tap its pension to balance its budget. The city created a pension trust fund in 2018 to set aside money to reduce pension bills and stabilize pension costs.\nPension liability is the difference between what the city owes retirees and the amount of money available to make those payments. Last year, Escondido had about $270 million in unfunded pension liability, and city leaders ended up pulling $1.5 million from its pension trust.\nCity Manager Sean McGlynn warned the City Council recently that the budget will only get more difficult to balance as the years go on.\nWithout existing funds to raid, there may be significant cuts to city services as early as next fiscal year.\n“Even though we’re finding a way to manage through our current circumstances, there are looming deficits that we can’t keep pace with,” McGlynn said.\nA few city services and departments have taken a hit over the past few years as city leaders try to reduce costs without sacrificing public safety and other priorities.\nLast year, I\nreported that the biggest impact has been to Escondido’s maintenance and public works. That includes upkeep of parks, playgrounds, libraries, recreation centers, pools, streets, sidewalks, bridges, storm drains, fleet and other city facilities.\nCity finance director Christina Holmes\ntold me in May 2023 that city staff estimates that more than $8 million of maintenance has been deferred annually since about 2008.\nHolmes said then that the annual $8 million in deferred maintenance compounds. So, a park or recreation center that has not been upgraded could remain that way until the city finds the funds to do so. In the meantime, that leaves roughly $128 million in backlogged fixes that Escondido still can’t pay for.\nThe City Council is set to approve the final budget for the upcoming fiscal year on June 19.\nSales Tax Measure, Round Three\nEscondido residents will likely get another opportunity to vote on a sales tax measure this November.\nA\ncitizens’ coalition called Escondido Citizens for Safety announced last week that it’s collected and submitted more than the required 7,600 signatures needed to qualify the measure. It reported collecting close to 12,000 signatures.\nThe coalition is led by the Escondido Police Officers Association and the Escondido Firefighters Association and is supported by an array of community leaders, business, labor and public safety organizations.\nThe measure will ask residents to vote on a one-cent sales tax increase that would sunset after 20 years. It also calls for a Citizens’ Oversight Committee to oversee how new revenue is spent.\nThe coalition says the measure would bring in an estimated $25 million each year in new revenue to the city to close its structural budget deficit.\nEscondido has had similar ballot measures twice before that were projected to raise around $20 million annually. The City Council\ndidn’t approve the first one in 2020, and voters rejected the second one at the ballot box in 2022.\nIn Other News\n- ICYMI: The Escondido Democratic Club is\nno longer supportingfour Democratic members of Palomar Health’s board who voted in favor of a new management agreement that the club’s leadership says could greatly reduce public access and transparency. (Voice of San Diego)\n- Speaking of Palomar Health, the healthcare district has agreed to a $250,000 settlement after disclosing to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency that\nfentanyl was divertedfrom automatic-dispensing equipment at its cardiac catheterization lab in Escondido.
