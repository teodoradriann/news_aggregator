The news release said Ed was a longtime card collector, starting when he was a kid during the early 1920s.\nEd’s son said his father would often receive baseball cards from his uncles as gifts when he was a child.\n“Like many of those who grew up in the Depression, my father and members of his family did not discard anything,” Ed’s son said in a statement. “When I was young, elementary school age, I remember my father showing me the cards and the tin they were in.”\nAmong the 600 cards in the tin were some of the most sought-after vintage baseball cards, including:\n1919-21 W514 “Shoeless” Joe Jackson Nearly every player from the iconic 1919 ‘Black Sox’ team 1921 E220 National Caramel Babe Ruth 1922 American Caramel E121 Babe Ruth 1919-21 Babe Ruth W514 1920 W519 Babe Ruth Ty Cobb 1922 American Caramel E121 1921 W516 Ty Cobb 1920 W519 George Sisler The century-old collection of rare baseball cards will be sold by Auction Monthly .\nAuction Monthly’s vice president said in a statement that he “couldn’t believe what was inside the old tobacco tin when I first opened the lid and noticed more than 600 pre-war baseball cards were all well preserved in the box.”\nThe auction house did not give an estimate of what the collection is worth.\nCopyright 2023 Gray Media Group, Inc.

[LEARN MORE](https://scrippsnews.com/stories/cinnamon-in-recalled-applesauce-pouches-had-extremely-high-lead-levels/) Nearly 5 million BlendJet devices in the U.S. and Canada will need to be replaced due to fire or injury risk. Portable blender maker Blendjet is recalling nearly 5 million of its devices after receiving dozens of injury reports and causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in consumer property damage. The [Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2024/BlendJet-Recalls-4-8-Million-BlendJet-2-Portable-Blenders-Due-to-Fire-and-Laceration-Hazards) issued a warning Thursday saying the company's BlendJet 2 Portable Blenders could overheat or catch fire and that their blades can break off while in use, affecting about 4.8 million products in the U.S. and 117,000 in Canada. — US Consumer Product Safety Commission (@USCPSC) [#Recall]: 4.8 Million [@BlendJet]2 Portable Blenders. The blenders can overheat or catch fire & the blender blades can break off. Get Free Replacement. Contact: [https://t.co/xqAPoZ0us1]or 844-334-0562. Full recall notice: [https://t.co/vXrV3uD3Ce] [pic.twitter.com/leQrtnmBn3] [December 28, 2023] So far, there have been 329 reports of blades coming off during use and 17 additional reports of overheating or fires that resulted in about $150,000 in property damage claims. These incidents also caused 49 reported minor burn injuries and one reported laceration injury. \"Out of an abundance of caution, our company updated the base of the BlendJet 2 to feature thicker blades and an improved electrical configuration,\" BlendJet said Thursday. \"These updates were incorporated many months ago into all BlendJet 2 devices manufactured by the company.\" The affected products were sold from October 2020 through November 2023 at Costco, Walmart, Target and other stores nationwide and online. U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Although BlendJet says the BlendJet 2s that are currently for sale are safe to use, the CPSC says consumers should verify if theirs is included and immediately stop use if so. To check your device's safety, identify the serial number printed on the bottom of the base. Those with the first four digits between 5201 and 5542 are subject to the recall. You can also go to BlendJet's [product recall tool](https://blendjet.com/safetyandrecall) to complete the identification process. If your device is affected, contact BlendJet for a free replacement of the blender's base unit. You will need to remove and cut the base's rubber seal and email or upload a photo to the company's website to receive the replacement part.

[Antonio Pérez del Castillo](https://www.cope.es/autores/antonio-perez-del-castillo) [@apdelcastillo](http://www.twitter.com/@apdelcastillo) Redactor Deportes COPE Tiempo de lectura: 3' Actualizado 08 mar 2024 [Este miércoles de madrugada volvimos a tener una mala noticia de Rafa Nadal](https://www.cope.es/deportes/tenis/noticias/rafa-nadal-anuncia-renuncia-masters-1000-indian-wells-puedo-mentirme-mismo-20240307_3183851). El tenista español anunciaba a las 3 de la mañana que renunciaba a jugar Indian Wells debido a sus problemas físicos. El tenista español escribía en sus redes sociales \"Con gran tristeza tengo que retirarme de este increíble torneo en Indian Wells\", comenzaba el comunicado en el que anunciaba su renuncia a participar, \"todo el mundo sabe cuánto amo este lugar y cuánto amo jugar aquí\": \"Esa es también una de las razones por las que vine muy temprano al desierto para practicar y tratar de prepararme\". Nadal asegura que \"no es una decisión fácil, es difícil de hecho, pero no puedo mentirme a mí mismo y mentirles a los miles de fans\": \"Los extrañaré a todos y estoy seguro de que el torneo será un gran éxito\". Los problemas de Nadal en 2024 Nadal tenía que jugar su primer partido del torneo este jueves, pero sus problemas físicos le hacían posponer de nuevo su retorno a las pistas. Después de que volviera en enero a jugar en el Torneo de Brisbane, finalmente caía en cuartos de final ante el australiano Jordan Thompson en tres sets (7-5, 6-7, 6-3), tras casi tres horas y media de encuentro y después de desperdiciar tres bolas de partido. Ese partido fue el 5 de enero y, desde ese momento, solo pudo jugar el partido de exhibición ante Carlos Alcaraz este pasado fin de semana, en el que acabó perdiendo en el súper tie break. Tras esta eliminación, [Nadal anunciaba que no jugaría el Open de Australia en un comunicad](https://www.cope.es/programas/tiempo-de-juego/noticias/rafa-nadal-anuncia-que-jugara-open-australia-por-una-lesion-20240107_3080225)o: “Hola a todos, durante mi último partido en Brisbane tuve un pequeño problema en un músculo que como sabéis me tuvo preocupado. Una vez que llegué a Melbourne tuve la oportunidad de hacerme una resonancia magnética y tengo un microdesgarro en un músculo, no en la misma parte donde tuve la lesión y eso es una buena noticia. Ahora mismo no estoy preparado para competir al máximo nivel de exigencia en partidos de cinco sets. Vuelvo a España para ver a mi médico, recibir tratamiento y descansar. He trabajado muy duro durante el año para este regreso y como siempre mencioné mi objetivo es estar en mi mejor nivel en tres meses. Dentro de la triste noticia para mí por no poder jugar frente al increíble público de Melbourne, esta no es una mala noticia y todos seguimos siendo positivos con la evolución de la temporada. Tenía muchas ganas de jugar aquí en Australia y he tenido la oportunidad de jugar algunos partidos que me han hecho muy feliz y positivo\". Ángel García habla del futuro de Nadal - Left6:No existe configuración de publicidad para el slot solicitado En El Partidazo de COPE, Ángl García, especialista en tenis de la Cadena COPE, habló de los nuevos problemas de Rafa Nadal que le han hecho renunciar a Indian Wells, pero mandó un mensaje positivo sobre su futuro: \"Ayer se probó en el entrenamiento y decidió que no era el momento de volver. Me cuentan que no está lesionado, que no ha recaído, pero que no se siente preparado para competir al máximo nivel. No quiere engañarse a sí mismo ni arriesgar la temporada de tierra, donde puede ser competitivo. Sus datos son preocupantes: tres partidos en catorce meses; año y medio sin ganar un título; número 652 del mundo y casi 38 años. Y aún así, he hablado con personas cercanas a Nadal y confían en que va a volver a ser competitivo en tierra. En abril empieza Montecarlo. Todo está enfocado a Roland Garros. Creo que va a jugar Montecarlo y Barcelona y, a partir de ahí, ya veremos\".

    "text": "The National Hurricane Center (NHC) continues to monitor a \"well-defined tropical wave\" in the Atlantic Ocean, currently bringing showers and thunderstorms over Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. This system, designated as Invest 97L, could develop into Tropical Storm Debby and pose a threat to the mainland US this weekend or early next week. Invest 97L is moving toward Florida and the Gulf of Mexico, prompting AccuWeather forecasters to warn residents from Louisiana to Florida's west coast to remain prepared. \"The latest models show it going into the eastern Gulf and then exploding there,\" said AccuWeather's lead long-range expert, Paul Pastelok. In response to the potential threat, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 54 of the state's 67 counties. The Pensacola News Journal reported that this could be the first major storm of the hurricane season, with the potential for weekslong river flooding. DeSantis urged residents to prepare for the storm and follow guidance from local emergency management officials. The NHC stated that while development is unlikely over the next few days as the system moves west-northwestward over portions of the Greater Antilles, conditions are expected to become more conducive for development afterward. A tropical depression could form this weekend or early next week over the eastern Gulf of Mexico or far southwestern Atlantic Ocean, including near Florida. The NHC advised interests across the Greater Antilles, Bahamas, and Florida to continue monitoring the system's progress, noting a 70% chance of formation within the next seven days. Forecasters emphasized the importance of readiness, with Pastelok warning and advising residents from Louisiana to Florida's west coast to be prepared for potential rapid intensification. The National Weather Service in Tampa echoed this, advising residents to monitor the system's progress and check their hurricane preparedness plans. With heavy rain in the forecast, they urged consideration of flooding vulnerabilities.",
