    "text": "Lorraine À la Une de votre quotidien du 27 septembre 2024 Le [pape François](/p/pape-francois), âgé de 87 ans, a passé sa journée au Luxembourg ce jeudi 26 septembre, dans le cadre de sa tournée en Belgique et de la célébration des 600 ans de l'université catholique de Louvain. L'événement a attiré énormément de monde : des Luxembourgeois bien sûr, mais aussi des frontaliers français, belges ou allemands. La dernière venue du chef de l'Église catholique au Luxembourg date de 1985 avec Jean-Paul II ! Après une visite de courtoisie au Grand-Duc Henri au Palais Grand-Ducal, le pape François a rencontré le Premier ministre, prononcé un discours au Cercle Cité et à la Cathédrale Notre-Dame. Une journée historique. C’est un épouvantable drame qui s’est produit, dans la nuit de mercredi à jeudi, à 2 h 30 du matin sur l’A31, à hauteur du pont de Beauregard à Thionville. Une personne, qui serait visiblement un homme, a chuté de la remorque d’un poids lourd et a été percutée par les voitures qui roulaient derrière. Une enquête est en cours pour identifier la victime et faire la lumière sur cette tragédie. Un Messin de 38 ans était présenté devant le tribunal correctionnel, ce 26 septembre, pour avoir agressé sexuellement une baby-sitter de 17 ans, en avril dernier. Des faits qu’il nie, affirmant avoir recueilli le consentement de l’adolescente alors qu’il la raccompagnait chez elle. Quatre ans de prison dont trois avec sursis sont requis.",

    "text": "New York appeals court overturns Harvey Weinstein’s sex crimes conviction and orders a new trial WCBS, CNN By Eric Levenson, CNN (CNN) — The New York Court of Appeals on Thursday overturned the [sex crimes conviction against Harvey Weinstein](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/11/us/harvey-weinstein-sentence/index.html), the powerful Hollywood producer whose downfall stood as a symbol of the #MeToo movement, and ordered a new trial. The court, by a 4-3 vote, ruled the testimony of “prior bad acts” witnesses should not have been allowed because it “was unnecessary to establish defendant’s intent and served only to establish defendant’s propensity to commit the crimes charged.” Weinstein, 72, was [convicted in 2020](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/11/us/harvey-weinstein-sentence/index.html) of first-degree criminal sexual act and third-degree rape, and he was sentenced to [23 years in prison](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/11/us/harvey-weinstein-sentence/index.html). He has maintained his innocence and denied any nonconsensual sexual activity. The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office said it plans to retry the case. “We will do everything in our power to retry this case, and remain steadfast in our commitment to survivors of sexual assault,” said Emily Tuttle, deputy director of communications and senior advisor for the office. Weinstein is being held at Mohawk Correctional Facility in Rome, New York, according to the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. The department said it is reviewing the appeals court’s decision. Weinstein will soon be taken from the correctional facility to Manhattan court and his trial will start anew, with a new judge and prosecutor, defense attorney Arthur Aidala said in a news conference. He is unlikely to be released because he was sentenced last year in Los Angeles to [16 years in prison for charges](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/23/entertainment/harvey-weinstein-sentencing-los-angeles/index.html) of rape and sexual assault. That trial similarly used “prior bad acts” witnesses and has also been appealed. Thursday’s ruling comes more than six years after reporting by [The New York Times and The New Yorker](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/06/us/harvey-weinstein-trial-jury-selection/index.html) in 2017 revealed Weinstein’s alleged history of sexual abuse, harassment and secret settlements as he used his influence as a Hollywood power broker to take advantage of young women. At the time, Weinstein was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood and helped produce movies such as “Pulp Fiction,” “Clerks” and “Shakespeare in Love.” The revelations led to a wave of women speaking publicly about the pervasiveness of sexual abuse and harassment in what became known as the #MeToo movement. Yet, #MeToo has had mixed success in the courtroom, and this is the second high-profile case to be overturned on appeal. The comedian Bill Cosby was convicted in 2018 of drugging and sexually assaulting a woman, but a Pennsylvania appeals court [overturned the conviction](https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/30/us/bill-cosby-to-be-released/index.html) in 2021, saying his due process rights were violated. Weinstein is ‘very grateful,’ attorney says The ruling overturning Weinstein’s conviction led to a range of reactions from those involved with the case. Upon hearing the news, Weinstein “heaped praise” on his legal team and was “very gracious” and “very grateful,” Aidala said. “The witnesses were there just to make Harvey Weinstein look bad,” Aidala said. “That’s the only reason why those witnesses were admitted. To show that he’s a bad guy. He was tried on his character, not the evidence.” “Justice was served,” said Donna Rotunno, the lead defense attorney at Weinstein’s trial in New York. “I believe this decision is larger than Harvey Weinstein. Courts cannot operate on emotion and lack of due process. The world is off-balance, and when the justice system does not work, nothing does. This decision restores faith in the foundation of our system.” “We are cautiously excited and need to study the ramifications of the appeal decision,” Weinstein’s spokesperson Juda Engelmayer said. “We always said this was an unjust trial.” Former Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., who brought the charges against Weinstein, said he was “shocked” by the decision. “I am deeply grateful to and humbled by the survivors who came forward in the brightest glare of a public courtroom to tell their stories at great personal cost and trauma,” Vance said in a statement. “The judicial system, in my opinion, has let them down today and did not advance justice. “ Dawn Dunning, one of the “prior bad acts” witnesses in Weinstein’s trial, said in a statement she did not regret testifying and urged the district attorney’s office to retry the case. “While I’m stunned that the court threw out Weinstein’s conviction on legal technicalities, I am still proud that I testified and confronted that convicted rapist,” she said. “I came forward to support other women who were also sexually abused by Weinstein and to ensure that he would be held accountable.” Miriam “Mimi” Haley, whose testimony made up the first-degree criminal sexual act charge, “would consider testifying again” in a potential retrial, her attorney Gloria Allred said in a statement. “Even though the process of testifying was grueling and retraumatizing for Mimi, she reaffirmed to me today that she would consider testifying again if (Manhattan) District Attorney Alvin Bragg decided to proceed with a new trial of Harvey Weinstein,” she said. “I commend Mimi on her courage and willingness to keep standing up for the truth.” Douglas H. Wigdor, an attorney who has represented eight of Weinstein’s accusers, including two of the “prior bad acts” witnesses at his New York criminal trial, also criticized the decision. “Today’s decision is a major step back in holding those accountable for acts of sexual violence,” he said in a statement. “Courts routinely admit evidence of other uncharged acts where they assist juries in understanding issues concerning the intent, modus operandi or scheme of the defendant. The jury was instructed on the relevance of this testimony and overturning the verdict is tragic in that it will require the victims to endure yet another trial.” What happened at his NY trial The New York charges were directly based on the testimony of [Haley and Jessica Mann](http://www.cnn.com/2020/01/23/us/witnesses-harvey-weinstein-trial/index.html). Haley testified that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006 at his Manhattan apartment, and Mann testified that he raped her in 2013 during what she described as an abusive relationship. In addition, three other women testified during the trial as “ [prior bad acts](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/23/us/witnesses-harvey-weinstein-trial/index.html)” witnesses as prosecutors sought to show Weinstein had a pattern of abuse. These women – Dunning, Tarale Wulff and Lauren Young – each said Weinstein used his Hollywood influence to take advantage of them when they were young and hoping to break into the film industry. After Weinstein was convicted in his New York trial, his attorneys [appealed the verdict](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/02/us/harvey-weinstein-appeal-ruling/index.html). They argued the judge should not have allowed these “prior bad acts” witnesses to testify and should not have given prosecutors the ability to question Weinstein about instances of verbal abuse and bullying on cross-examination. (Weinstein ultimately did not testify in the case.) The Court of Appeals agreed with the defense on those points. “We conclude that the trial court erroneously admitted testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts against persons other than the complainants of the underlying crimes because that testimony served no material non-propensity purpose,” the ruling, written by Judge Jenny Rivera, states. “The court compounded that error when it ruled that defendant, who had no criminal history, could be cross examined about those allegations as well as numerous allegations of misconduct that portrayed defendant in a highly prejudicial light. The synergistic effect of these errors was not harmless.” Yet in a stinging dissent, Judge Madeline Singas wrote that the majority opinion “perpetuates outdated notions of sexual violence and allows predators to escape accountability.” “This conclusion deprives juries of the context necessary to do their work, forecloses the prosecution from using an essential tool to prove intent, ignores the nuances of how sexual violence is perpetrated and perceived, and demonstrates the majority’s utter lack of understanding of the dynamics of sexual assault,” Singas wrote. “Because New York’s women deserve better, I dissent.” The use of “prior bad acts” witnesses has [increased in recent years](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/09/us/weinstein-metoo-prior-bad-acts/index.html) with the rise of the #MeToo movement. In sexual assault cases, their testimony can turn a difficult “he said, she said” case into a more convincing “he said, they said” case. In general, evidence that the [defendant has poor character](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_404) or has done bad things in the past is not allowed during a trial. The fear is that the jury will be overly influenced by these prior incidents and may ignore the actual evidence of the alleged crime. “Prior bad acts” evidence is one exception to this rule. It can be used to prove the defendant’s “motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident,” according to [federal evidence rules](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_404). Judges have a fair amount of discretion to decide what is and what isn’t allowed in court as they try to balance the relevance of the testimony against the prejudice to the jury.

    "text": "Azerbaijani people pay tribute to 20 January martyrs (PHOTOS) Thirty-four years have passed since the tragic events of Bloody January. As is customary each year, the people of Azerbaijan pay profound respect to the martyrs of 20 January. Large crowds have been heading towards the Alley of Martyrs since the early hours of 20 January, placing carnations at the graves of martyrs. The day is etched in the history of our nation not only as a tragedy but also as a page of heroism. Alongside the prevailing sadness, the faces of tens of thousands of people bowing in front of the martyrs' graves reflect a sense of pride. People from all walks of life are gathering at the Alley of Martyrs – veterans of the Patriotic War, soldiers, representatives of public institutions, young people, and schoolchildren. This collective display is a manifestation of the people's respect and reverence for the heroic sons and daughters of the Motherland. Today, commemorative events and ceremonies are taking place not only in Baku but also in regions and foreign countries, with prayers being offered for the souls of the martyrs. We recall the events of 20 January 1990 when units of the Soviet army and special forces, along with internal troops, committed a military aggression against Azerbaijan. In an effort to suppress the demonstrations held as a sign of protest against the deportation of hundreds of thousands of our compatriots from Western Azerbaijan and Armenia's groundless territorial claims against Karabakh, the Soviet army rolled on Baku and the regions to stifle the national liberation movement and committed an unprecedented massacre against the civilian population. As a result, 150 civilians were killed and more than 700 people were seriously injured. On the morning following the tragic events, National Leader Heydar Aliyev went to the permanent representative office of Azerbaijan in Moscow, vehemently condemned this heinous crime committed against the Azerbaijani people, and demanded punishment of the guilty. The first political and legal assessment of the tragedy of 20 January at state level was given by great Heydar Aliyev. The martyrs were immortalized, 20 January was declared the Day of National Mourning, and social protection of the families of the martyrs and disabled persons was strengthened. Continuing this policy, President Ilham Aliyev pays special attention to the disabled and families of martyrs of 20 January. Health centers have been established for the rehabilitation of the disabled, apartments and cars have been handed out to disabled people and families of the martyrs of 20 January. The presidential pension for the families of 20 January martyrs and wounded people has also been raised. The martyrs’ blood did not remain unavenged. Our people have regained independence, and our lands, which have been under occupation for about 30 years, were liberated on the battlefield. The troubled souls of the martyrs of 20 January finally found peace after the historic Victory won in the 44-day Patriotic War under the leadership of President of Azerbaijan and Victorious Commander-in-Chief Ilham Aliyev. Short time later, the Karabakh Victory followed with its expected continuation. On September 19, 2023, the presence of separatists in Karabakh was brought to an end through local anti-terrorist measures. The National Flag of Azerbaijan was raised in Khankendi, Khojaly, Asgaran and other liberated territories. Thus, the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Azerbaijan have been fully restored. Our dear martyrs, who paved the first path and sacrificed their lives for freedom and victories, will never be forgotten. Their bright memories will live on in our hearts forever.",

    "text": "Columnist Russ Vernon-Jones: A win for the climate\n|Published: 02-15-2024 7:28 PM|\nFor the last two months I’ve written to you about the U.S. becoming the world’s largest exporter of climate-destroying gas and oil; about the fossil fuel industry’s plans to vastly expand these harmful exports; and about a campaign to stop them by getting the Biden administration to stop issuing permits for new export terminals.\nToday, I’m writing to share the good news that the campaign was successful! President Biden put a halt to all new LNG (Liquefied methane “Natural” Gas) export terminal permits on Jan. 26.\nThis is a big deal. It’s a win for the climate and for people everywhere who are impacted by climate change. It’s a win for the frontline communities along the Louisiana and Texas Gulf Coast who are fighting the increased air pollution, destruction of the local fishing industry, damaging health effects, and environmental destruction that more terminals would bring. It’s a win for everyone who thinks that the welfare of people and the planet is more important than further increasing the obscene profits of the gas and oil companies.\nThis is also a big deal because of how the decision came about — everything from TikTok to Jane Fonda played a role. Biden’s decision was a direct result of a grassroots campaign that put pressure on him not to approve any additional terminal permits. It was a remarkable demonstration of what people power can do.\nLed by frontline activists from the Gulf Coast, this campaign eventually included over 400,000 people signing a petition, a\nTikTok storm that probably reached over a million views, thousands of handwritten letters from senior citizens, a letter from 60 members of Congress, one from 170 scientists, and one from over 250 environmental and community groups, leaders of major climate organizations, celebrities including Mark Ruffalo and Jane Fonda, and over 600 people pledging to engage in civil disobedience at the Department of Energy in D.C. if Biden didn’t stop the permitting.\nThis is also a big deal because it is one of the first times that the government has taken action to limit the fossil fuel industry. The Inflation Reduction Act has provided powerful incentives for adopting renewable energy, but it did nothing to limit fossil fuels. We need to do both. Finally, we have begun.\nWhat Biden actually did was “pause” the issuing of permits. This was a strategic choice. A denial of permits could have been challenged in court and quickly overthrown. The pause does not have this vulnerability. The pause also will be used to revise the government’s process for considering future permits to include climate effects in determining whether a project is in the public interest.\nTo no one’s surprise, the fossil fuel industry is fighting back. They have launched a multimillion-dollar public relations campaign and gotten allies in Congress to hold hostile hearings. Of course, the presidential election will be key. Donald Trump has announced that if he is elected, he will immediately increase drilling and export terminal construction and remove incentives for renewable energy.\nThere also are more struggles for climate advocates to have with the Biden administration, which is still using U.S. taxpayer money to\n[back]() fossil fuel infrastructure development in other countries, in violation of an international agreement we signed in 2021.\nNonetheless,\nBiden’s statement announcing the halt to permitting was remarkable. Even though he is president of a major gas- and oil-producing nation, he began his statement with, “In every corner of the country and the world, people are suffering the devastating toll of climate change.”\nHe went right at the MAGA Republicans, accusing them of “condemning the American people to a dangerous future” with their denial of the urgency of the climate crisis. He called the fossil fuel industry a “special interest” to which he will not bow.\nHe went on to call climate change “the existential threat of our time.” He acknowledged the importance of youth and frontline voices: “We will heed the calls of young people and frontline communities who are using their voices to demand action from those with the power to act.”\nAny win against the fossil fuel industry is a big win. Everyone who cares at all about the climate gets to celebrate this win and feel good about it. We also know that we still have a long struggle ahead of us — a struggle to end the harmful effects that the unscrupulous pursuit of profits by the oil and gas companies is having on our politics, our health, and the climate we share with all living creatures.\nRuss Vernon-Jones of Amherst is a member of the Steering Committee of Climate Action Now (CAN).

    "text": "Federal Education Minister Jason Clare has delivered a blunt message to Nine chairman Peter Costello [amid accusations the former treasurer assaulted The Australian journalist Liam Mendes by pushing him over at Canberra Airport on Thursday.](https://7news.com.au/news/moment-channel-nine-chairman-peter-costello-allegedly-assaults-journalist-at-airport-c-14934653) Canberra Airport has said it would provide the CCTV footage to the police and to the journalist, if requested, according to several reports on Sunrise. WATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Federal MPs weigh in after Nine chairman Peter Costello accused of assaulting journalist at airport. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: [Download today ](https://7news.com.au/app?utm_source=7NEWS&utm_medium=contextual-link-app&utm_campaign=7news-app) Costello has strenuously denied pushing or assaulting Mendes after he was approached by Mendes and asked questions about the sexual harassment scandal engulfing the Channel Nine news division. “You’ve got to answer the questions, Mr Costello. Don’t, don’t. You’ve just assaulted me,” Mendes can be heard saying in a video capturing the event. However, Costello later denied pushing the reporter. “There was a reporter walking backwards with his phone filming. As I walked past him he walked back into an advertising placard and he fell over,” Costello said. “I did not strike him. If he’s upset about that, I’m sorry. But I did not strike him.” On Friday, Clare joined Nat Barr and deputy leader of the Opposition, Sussan Ley, for Hot Topics, where they addressed the incident. “Everyone should be safe at work,” Clare said, clarifying he was speaking in general terms. “Nobody should be pushing other people around. The journalist said it did happen. Mr Costello said it didn’t happen. “There is CCTV footage I am sure the airport has (it). “It is a question as to if they will release that or provide it to the police,” Clare said. Clare said the simplest way to deal with a question from a reporter was to just stop and answer it. Meanwhile, Ley said such an act would be out of character for Costello. “I have known Peter Costello for many years, and I have never known him to be aggressive in nature. “There are different camera angles. I haven’t seen them all. “Peter has spoken about it and the journalist has spoken about it. It is worth remembering that in public life people do need to be respectful whether they are public figures, journalists, politicians, whoever. “It is an untidy incident. We do need to maintain respect, but let’s see.” Channel Nine’s veteran news director Darren Wick [sensationally quit the company earlier this year following allegations](https://7news.com.au/news/female-staffer-complaint-reportedly-preceded-nine-entertainment-news-boss-darren-wicks-departure-c-14727333) of inappropriate behaviour towards a female staff member. Wick quit the company on March 15 after a long period of leave starting in mid-January. More than a dozen current and former Nine employees have since spoken to The Daily Telegraph, on condition of anonymity, about a culture they allege allowed Wick to behave inappropriately and get away with it.

    "text": "A heavy rain and flash flooding warning has been issued across NSW as up to 200 millimetres of rain is predicted to fall in some areas. The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) is predicting the South Coast, Illawarra and Southern Tablelands will receive the heaviest rain on Saturday and continue into Sunday. There is the potential for up to 200 millimetres to fall over 24 hours. 18:20 AEST18:25 AEST18:30 AEST18:35 AEST18:40 AEST18:45 AEST18:50 AEST \"What's going to happen this afternoon is the rain band with these embedded thunderstorms is forecast to continue moving eastward while shifting the focus to the coast,\" BoM Meteorologist Sarah Scully said. Scully said there was the potential for severe thunderstorms in the Sydney metropolitan area and the Illawarra, that may lead to flash flooding. \"Grounds are really wet across this region due to recent rain fall and that increases the chance of both flash and riverine flooding. \"This heavy rainfall is forecast to continue into Sunday as the onshore flow pushes into the coast, whereas further north, that rain band will start to push out and clear from northern parts. \"It's not really until Monday however, that the rain really clears the southern and central parts of the coast.\" A flood watch has been issued for minor riverine flooding in the Hawkesbury Nepean Valley and South Coast from Saturday. The State Emergency Service (SES) is warning residents to take proactive measures to ensure their safety. NSW SES Assistant Commissioner Nicole Hogan said the main risk associated with the forecast was flash flooding but minor riverine rises were possible. \"We're closely monitoring the weather and are prepared to respond swiftly to any emergencies that may arise,\" Hogan said. \"Our teams are on standby, and we have prepositioned people and assets to assist the community and mitigate the impacts of heavy rainfall.\" It has rained in Sydney every day this month so far, causing the city to receive its entire May rainfall average in just six days.",
