    "text": "Boeing Navigates Labor Strike Amid Financial Turmoil Boeing faces another challenge as West Coast factory workers go on strike, following a series of crises that have affected the company's financial health and stock value. With over 30,000 workers demanding better wages, negotiations are set to resume soon, potentially impacting Boeing's cash flow and future operations. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 13-09-2024 21:51 IST | Created: 13-09-2024 21:51 IST Boeing is urgently seeking to return to the bargaining table after factory workers on the U.S. West Coast initiated a strike on Friday. This latest crisis follows a turbulent period for the planemaker, which has been under severe scrutiny from U.S. regulators and customers since a door panel incident involving a 737 MAX jet in January. The series of crises has taken a toll on Boeing's stock, resulting in a 2.3% drop on Friday and a 38% decline year-to-date, translating to a loss of $58 billion in market value. Both Boeing and the union have expressed willingness to resume negotiations swiftly. A total of about 30,000 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), who manufacture Boeing's popular 737 MAX and other jets in Seattle and Portland, overwhelmingly rejected the first full contract offer in 16 years. Union leader Jon Holden affirmed the union's commitment to expediting negotiations, though the strike's duration and the resumption date for talks remain uncertain.

    "text": "BANGOR — Travelers at Bangor International Airport were stunned Thursday by the news of an American Airlines flight’s midair collision with a military helicopter in Washington, D.C.\n“We had flown out of DCA yesterday on that exact runway,” traveler Andrew Wimer said.\nDespite DCA reopening Thursday at 11 a.m., all American Airlines flights to and from Bangor to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport were canceled through Friday morning.\n“We were automatically rebooked for tomorrow, but we stopped by to see what our options were,” Wimer said.\nWimer and his colleagues, who were in Maine on business, were rebooked for a 12:35 p.m. flight Friday.\n“We all live in D.C. and have family down there,” Wimer said. “So we’re just going to drive to Boston and try to get a flight from there.”\nAs travelers scrambled to find alternate routes home, questions arose about the aircraft involved in the crash.\nThe plane involved in Wednesday night’s incident is the same model American Airlines uses for its Bangor-to-D.C. commuter flight. In fact, according to FlightAware, the exact plane involved in the midair collision made two trips through Bangor International Airport earlier this week—once on Sunday and again on Tuesday.\n“We are constantly preparing and training for emergency scenarios because you never know. Unfortunately, accidents do happen,” the Marketing & Business Development Manager for Bangor International Airport Aimee Thibodeau said.\nDespite the accident, travelers flying out of Bangor say they feel safe.\n“I trust people—flying’s a lot safer than driving any day,” traveler Gerald Gibby said.\nFlights between Bangor and D.C. are scheduled to resume Friday afternoon. However, airport officials remind travelers to always check their flight status before heading to the airport.\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Alex Schley Reporter\nAuthor email Follow Alex Schley Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!
