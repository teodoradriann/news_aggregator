    "text": "A hard-hit Israeli kibbutz has announced the death of Judih Weinstein — an American-Canadian-Israeli woman who had been thought to be held hostage in Gaza. The news came six days after Ms Weinstein’s husband, Gad Haggai, was also declared dead. Ms Weinstein, 70, and Mr Haggai, 73, were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of October 7 when Hamas militants burst across the border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others. In the early hours of the morning, Ms Weinstein was able to call emergency services and let them know that both she and her husband had been shot and send a message to her family. Ms Weinstein and her husband had been thought to be among the hostages still held in captivity in Gaza. But six days ago, the kibbutz announced that Mr Haggai was killed on October 7 and his body was taken to Gaza. On Thursday, the kibbutz said it had learned that Ms Weinstein was also killed on October 7 and her body is also being held in Gaza. It was not immediately clear how Israeli authorities determined their deaths. The couple are survived by two sons and two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbutz said. US President Joe Biden said he was “devastated” to learn of Ms Weinstein’s death, especially after hearing about the couple during a meeting with their daughter. The families “have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal”, he said in a statement. Ms Weinstein was born in New York and was an active member of Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border where she taught English to children with special needs. The kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza. Mr Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician. “Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,” her family said in a statement. In a YouTube video made during a brief round of fighting between Israel and the Islamic Jihad militant group last May, Ms Weinstein read a series of poems and expressed hope for better days ahead. “I truly hope that the next time I’m recording some Haiku it won’t be under duress, under rocket fire, under conditions where people are at war,” she said. “May we all be granted the right to our basic rights of home, food, shelter and peaceful days. Here’s hoping.” Al Haggai, one of the couple’s sons, told Israel’s Channel 13 that the family had originally hoped their mother’s multiple citizenships would allow her to be released during the week-long ceasefire in late November, when 105 hostages were let go. Almost all were women and children. He said that when his mother’s name was not on any of the daily lists, he started to suspect that something had happened to her. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, at least 23 of the approximately 129 hostages believed to be held in Gaza have either died or been killed in captivity. Nir Oz was one of the hardest-hit Israeli communities on October 7, with roughly a quarter of its residents killed or kidnapped. The families of missing hostages have drawn widespread support and sympathy in Israel as they press the government to reach a new ceasefire deal to bring home their loved ones. Mr Netanyahu met on Thursday in Tel Aviv with some of the families, where he told them there were behind-the-scene efforts to bring the hostages home, according to a statement from his office. “I can’t elaborate on the details, we are working to return everyone,” he said.

[ANI](/ani-stories)| Updated: 29-12-2023 08:14 IST | Created: 29-12-2023 08:14 IST - Country: - India With the arrest of three accused, police claimed to have busted a UP-based cow-slaughtering gang active in Delhi-NCR, police said. \"Delhi Police Joint Team of AATS/NED and PS Karawal Nagar busted a cow slaughtering gang of Sambhal (UP) active in Delhi-NCR and solved the cow slaughtering case and arrested three accused,\" police said. According to the police, the apprehended accused have been identified as Wajhat alias Ajju (32), Jahane Alam alias Jahna (30), and Sajid alias Sadva (28). All the accused are residents of UP's Amroha district. A four-wheeler vehicle used in the commission of crime has also been recovered, police said. The main accused, Sajid alias Sadwa, is a notorious criminal who was caught earlier by UP Police in an encounter, and he came out of jail in July 2023. According to North East Delhi DCP Joy Tirkey, a PCR call was received in Karawal Nagar police station on December 24 informing that some severed heads of cow and other parts were found near Janki Panchal Vihar, Karawal Nagar, Delhi. Accordingly, a case under Section 429 and 424(4) of the IPC and Section 12 of the Prevention of Cruelty Against Animals Act was registered at Karawal Nagar Police Station, and an investigation was subsequently taken up. During the course of the investigation, all possible efforts were made to trace the accused persons. Several CCTV footages were analysed, and upon analysing the CCTV footage, a 'Honda City' car was found involved in the case, police said. The route of the car was followed, and it was found that three people disembarked from the car near Seemapuri Depot, Delhi. Based on collected inputs and information, the police zeroed in on three suspected persons and succeeded in apprehending them from their rented accommodation in Old Mustafabad, Delhi. On verification, their identities were established. On sustained interrogation, the apprehended accused confessed to their crime and further disclosed that they procured the 'Xylaxin' injections used to make cows unconscious from a chemist in Jafrabad and used to lift stray cows from various areas of Delhi-NCR. According to the police, 17 syringes and 34 needles were also recovered from their possession. All three accused persons have been found to be dreaded criminals, previously involved in more than 15 cow slaughtering cases registered in Nagli (UP), Shalimar Bagh, and Gokulpuri, while other locations are still being verified, police said.

    "title": "Xiaomi 14, 14 Pro and Watch S3 Get Two New Colors To Celebrate SU7 Launch",
    "text": "Earlier today, [Xiaomi](https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Xiaomi) introduced the Xiaomi SU7, its very first electric car at an event in China. At the end of the [event](https://www.gizchina.com/2023/12/28/xiaomi-electric-car-xiaomi-su7/), to celebrate the launch, the company introduced its Xiaomi 14, 14 Pro, and Watch S3 devices in Limited Edition Aqua Blue, and Verdant Green colors, matching the colors of the new car. The new color options will join the existing Jade Green, Black, White, and Snow Mountain Pink colors. They use a black high-gloss metal middle frame + a glass back panel of the same color as the car. Through this [article](https://www.fonearena.com/blog/413086/xiaomi-14-xiaomi-14-pro-and-watch-s3-get-blue-and-green-limited-edition-versions.html), we will talk about the two new colors. New Exclusive Colors for the Xiaomi 14 series and the Watch S3 When it comes to the Xiaomi Watch S3, the new color options will join the Black, Silver, and Brown Leather colorways. Interestingly, the new colors come with a “Limited Edition” text on the casing around the display. The watch looks stunning in these new color options. Gizchina News of the week When it comes to the price there are no surprises for the Xiaomi 14 or 14 Pro. The limited edition custom color versions will cost the same as the original version. The price will start at CNY 4,999 ($707) for the Xiaomi 14. The Xiaomi 14 Pro in these limited colors will start at CNY 5,999 ($849). When it comes to the Xiaomi Watch S3, it is CNY 100 more expensive than the original eSIM version. It will cost CNY 1,099 ($155). The specifications of these devices will remain the same regardless of the new color options. Unfortunately, they are limited to the Chinese market as the Xiaomi SU7 also is. The whole “Limited Edition” term probably means that these units will be sold in a small quantity and will be limited to that particular market. So, we don’t have many hopes of seeing them outside of China. Despite this, it’s interesting to see Xiaomi trying to pair its products with the newest electric vehicle. The SU7 probably is one of the most advanced and costlier products released by Xiaomi, so the company is trying to bring all the attention to it.

    "text": "Un adolescent de 15 ans a été tué par un requin dans un spot de surf reculé de l’État d’Australie du Sud, a annoncé vendredi la police.\nL’attaque s’est produite jeudi après-midi au large d’Ethel Beach, dans la péninsule de Yorke, a indiqué la police dans un communiqué. «Malheureusement, le corps d’un adolescent a été récupéré dans l’eau», a-t-elle ajouté, précisant que la victime était originaire de la banlieue sud d’Adelaïde.\nSelon un habitant d’Ethel Beach cité par le quotidien d’Adelaïde «The Advertiser», un autre surfeur a tenté de se porter au secours de l’adolescent qui venait d’être mordu à une jambe. «Le requin faisait des ronds autour d’eux pendant que le gars tirait le garçon hors de l’eau. Il y avait beaucoup de sang», a-t-il dit. On ignore quelle espèce de requin a commis l’attaque, mais les grands requins blancs sont nombreux dans les eaux du sud de l’Australie.\nRéchauffement En octobre, des témoins avaient vu un requin emporter un surfeur de 55 ans dans sa mâchoire à Granite Beach, également en Australie du Sud. Le corps n’a jamais été retrouvé. Un grand requin blanc avait été aperçu rôdant dans les environs.\nEn mai, un surfeur de 46 ans avait été attaqué par un requin à Walkers Rock Beach, dans le même État. Son corps n’a jamais été retrouvé non plus, les équipes de recherche ne mettant la main que sur un fragment de sa combinaison de surf.\nLe nombre de morsures de requins a augmenté au cours des quatre dernières décennies en raison notamment de l’augmentation la population et du changement climatique, selon des experts. Le réchauffement des océans conduit les requins à se rapprocher des côtes à la recherche de proies, le rendant ainsi plus susceptibles d’entrer en contact avec les humains.\n(AFP)",

    "title": "Karnataka: BJP raps CM on hijab; leaders ask students to don saffron shawls",
    "text": "Bengaluru: Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's statement about the state government's proposal to lift the ban on hijab in educational institutions triggered a fresh row on Saturday, with the BJP launching a scathing attack on the Congress-led government.\nSome Opposition leaders called upon Hindu students to sport saffron shawls on campuses in retaliation, even as Congress leaders backed the CM's statement.\nSpeaking to reporters, Union Parliamentary Affairs minister Pralhad Joshi termed Siddaramaiah's statement as \"foolish\". \"The BJP had not imposed ban on wearing hijab. The previous government clearly mentioned that wearing any religious outfit was not allowed only in places with uniform policy,\" he said.\n\"Will the government allow if anyone wears saffron shawls to schools tomorrow?\" he sought to know, adding that such government decisions would only create unrest in society.\nVijayapura legislator Basangouda Patil Yatnal minced no words in calling for retaliation. Taking to social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Yatnal said: \"I call upon Hindu students to wear saffron shawls in educational institutions if the government permits hijab against the order of the High of Court of Karnataka... CM Siddaramaiah has already stated that uniforms are not compulsory and everyone is free to wear whatever they wish.\"\nFormer chief ministers BS Yediyurappa and Basavaraj Bommai urged Siddaramaiah to stop appeasement politics. Such decisions will only create a rift in society, the senior leaders said. If the Congress government does not stop such political gimmicks, people will teach them a lesson in the upcoming Look Sabha polls, Yediyurappa said.\nBommai added that Siddaramaiah was focusing on non-issues which were of no public concern to divert attention from \"burning issues like the Cauvery conflict and corruption\".\nAmid backlash from the BJP, Siddaramaiah's colleagues stood in his support.\nLaw and Parliamentary Affairs minister HK Patil said the motto of the Congress government was equality of all faiths. \"The previous BJP government had created controversy over it. Now, we are trying to rectify it,\" said the minister. He however did not elaborate on the issue citing that the matter was in the Supreme Court.\nThe Karnataka Education Act 1983 and rules introduced about uniforms in 2013 and 2018 provide provision only to wear and follow the uniform decided by that particular school and college and even the right to decide about the uniform has been given to School Development and Management Committees (SDMC).\nD Shashi Kumar, general Secretary of the Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka said this decision was not up to the government. \"The powers to prescribe uniforms is left to the school managements concerned and SDMCs. If any particular institution allows children to wear any religious outfit, then that is their right,\" he said.\nNiranjanaradhya V P, Development Educationist, added, \"Education is a fundamental right of every student in accordance with international and national legal instruments. The state is obliged to create a conducive environment for realisation of it. In this context, the statement of chief minister to remove all barriers is a welcoming move.\"\nThe hijab controversy flared up in 2022 when a group of students at a PU College in Udupi started wearing hijabs to classrooms which was opposed by their Hindu counterparts. Eventually, the state government issued an order banning religious attire on the premises of educational institutions in keeping with the Karnataka Education Act.\n 23 December 2023, 21:40 IST)",

    "text": "Chennai: At least one in every two patients lost an average of 4kg (BMI of 1.6 kg/month) after nudges from health coaches. The coaches from Apollo Hospitals who pushed people to go in for periodic health checks also managed to help them significantly bring down their blood pressure and sugars, said doctors.Riding on its success, the group launched a digital health risk assessment called ‘ProHealth Score’, hospital chairman Dr Prathap C Reddy said. The free risk score evaluates factors such as family history, lifestyle, and current symptoms and generates a personalised numeric indicator of a person’s health status. Additionally, it provides simple corrective measures to guide you toward better health. “The effort is to prod people to undergo health checks and lead a healthy lifestyle,” said hospital CEO for Preventive Healthcare, Dr Sathya Sriram.In a group of nearly 17,000 people, the hospital’s digital records show that about half of the group lost weight, with an average loss of 4 kg and a BMI decrease of 1.6 kg/month in 21 months, said Apollo Hospitals CEO and president, Dr Madhu Sasidhar. At least 70% of them with high blood pressure saw an improved average decline in systolic (24 mmHg) and diastolic (15 mmHg) blood pressure. In a smaller group of about 8,000 people, nearly three out of five people brought down their HbA1C levels by an average of 1.45 mmol/mol in 21 months.The difference will help people prevent or delay diseases and complications, doctors said. The surge in non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory ailments, and cancer accounts for 63% of all deaths in the country. “People must take action to protect themselves, their families, and their communities from the escalating burden of non-communicable diseases,” said hospital vice-chairman Preetha Reddy.We also published the following articles recently5 dead and over 100 hospitalized from recalled Japanese health supplementsFive deaths and 114 hospitalized due to intake of Japanese health supplements, including Benikoji Choleste Help with red mold.

    "text": "Today is World Children's Mental Health Awareness Day: How to preserve it for Ukrainian children in the midst of war Kyiv • UNN Ukrainian children face mental health challenges due to the Russian invasion, including lack of basic resources, pessimistic emotions, family separation, and normalization of violence, which requires parents to support them, encourage open communication, and teach coping strategies. Today, on May 7, various events are taking place in many countries around the world on the occasion of World Children's Mental Health Awareness Day, UNN writes. The event was launched in the United States and Canada and quickly became relevant in many countries around the world. Mental health is an important component of children's overall health and has a complex and interactive relationship with their physical health and ability to succeed in school, work, and society. Both physical and mental health affect the way we think, feel and act inside and out. It is essential to address the mental health needs of children and adolescents early in their development to ensure that they lead productive lives as adults. The need to preserve the mental health of Ukrainian children has become especially urgent in the context of the full-scale Russian invasion. Psychologists identify the main mental problems that Ukrainian children face today: - Lack of basic necessities of basic resources (adequate housing, places of recreation, food and water). This makes it difficult to create adequate conditions for children; - Pessimistic emotions. One of the main consequences of war is the loss of hope; - Separation of families. During war, many family members are killed or captured by the enemy. The loss of family members causes significant stress or anxiety for children; Normalization of violence. Most children begin to perceive violent acts as normal. In order to distract children from negative thoughts and emotions, psychologists give the following advice to parents in the first place: - Spend time with children during breakfast or dinner, as children need to work on building strong relationships with their peers and family. Talk to your children about pressing issues. Show love and care for your children. Ask questions about their interests and activities; - Teach children to solve a variety of problems. Praise your child every time he or she makes progress or succeeds at a task; - Encourage children to talk about their feelings (whether good or bad); - Teach your children ways to relax when they are stressed. This could be deep breathing, yoga, being alone, or going for a walk; - Be careful when talking to children (do not bring up family, financial problems, illnesses). Often children get very stressed about these things. If you want to share this, be delicate and tell them that sometimes it is normal to cope with such situations; - Keep track of how much time your children spend in front of the gadget screen. You should know who they interact with on the Internet and social media.
