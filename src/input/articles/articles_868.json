    "text": "Schumachers Urlaubs-Idylle zerstört – „Es ist eine Schande“\nDie Schumachers besitzen auf Mallorca ein luxuriöses Anwesen. Auch Michael Schumacher wird zur Erholung immer wieder eingeflogen. Doch die Ruhe wird massiv gestört.\nGland/Port d’Andratx – Kaum eine Insel hat so eine hohe Anziehungskraft auf deutsche Urlauber und Auswanderer wie Mallorca. Besonders das Örtchen Port d‘Andratx erfreut sicher hoher Beliebtheit. In der exklusiven Hafenstadt haben auch zahlreiche Stars und Sternchen ein Anwesen – darunter auch Michael Schumacher.\nDas Anwesen der Familie Schumacher befindet sich weit über dem Nobelhafen und zählt zu den schönsten Grundstücken Mallorcas. Die Villa auf Mallorca, die sich seit 2018 im Besitz der Familie befindet, wird jedoch regelmäßig von Familienmitgliedern genutzt. Und auch der Rekordweltmeister wird immer wieder eingeflogen, um die Ruhe der spanischen Insel zu genießen. Doch seit einiger Zeit ist es damit vorbei.\nNeubauprojekt stört Ruhe rund um Schumacher-Anwesen\nDer Grund: ein großes Neubauprojekt. Dafür wird derzeit in unmittelbarer Nähe zum Schumacher-Anwesen ein Berghang abgetragen. „Es dröhnt durch den ganzen Hafen. Der Lärm ist bis nach Camp de Mar zu hören. Es ist unerträglich“, berichtet eine deutsche Anwohnerin der Mallorca Zeitung.\nDas Ausmaß der Bauarbeiten ist beträchtlich. „Nun haben sie jedoch ein riesiges Loch vor der Nase. Der ganze Berg wird bebaut und zerstückelt. Nur ein Teil bleibt noch unverschont, weil die Zugangsstraße fehlt. Es ist eine Schande“, klagt die Anwohnerin weiter. Lediglich im Sommer sei es ruhiger. Denn im Juli und August dürfen laute Baumaschienen nicht benutzt werden. Die Arbeiten dauern noch bis Februar 2026 an.\nMichael Schumacher verbringt die meiste Zeit am Genfer See\nOb sich die Schumachers eben so am Baulärm stören, ist unklar. Michael Schumacher selbst verbringt die meiste Zeit des Jahres ohnehin in seinem Anwesen am Genfer See in der Schweiz, wo er seit seinem schweren Skiunfall im Dezember 2013 betreut wird. Seither haben nur noch weniger Menschen Zugang zu dem Rekordweltmeister.\nEin ehemaliger Weggefährte Schumachers äußerte kürzlich Besorgnis über den Gesundheitszustand des siebenmaligen Formel-1-Weltmeisters. Die genauen Umstände bleiben jedoch weiterhin privat. Ein Ex-Teamkollege erklärte in diesem Zusammenhang, dass die spärlichen Informationen zum Gesundheitszustand Schumachers dem Wunsch der Familie nach Privatsphäre geschuldet seien. (smo)",

    "text": "Judih Weinstein Haggai, a 70-year-old who was believed to have been taken hostage by Hamas, was actually killed during the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, her family and Kibbutz Nir Oz said in statements on Thursday.\nMs. Haggai’s husband, Gadi Haggai, had also been listed as a hostage but the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum announced last week that he, too, was killed in the attacks.\nThe forum said the couple were shot while on their morning walk through the fields of the kibbutz, and that Ms. Haggai had managed to inform friends that they had been injured, her husband critically so.\nMs. Haggai was, in fact, fatally wounded, and her death has now been confirmed, Kibbutz Nir Oz said on Thursday. Its statement did not specify how it learned that she had died in the attack.\nThe couple’s bodies are being held by Hamas, according to the kibbutz, their family and the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum. The groups said the couple were citizens of both Israel and the United States, and that Ms. Haggai also had Canadian citizenship.\nPresident Biden said he and Jill Biden, the first lady, were holding the couple’s “four children, seven grandchildren and other loved ones close to our hearts.”\n“I will never forget what their daughter, and the family members of other Americans held hostage in Gaza, have shared with me,” he said in a statement . “They have been living through hell for weeks.”\nMs. Haggai would be remembered “for the creative life she built with her husband,” her family said, adding that “their murders are a reminder for leaders everywhere to bring the hostages home now before it is too late.”\nThe post Israeli-American Thought to Be a Hostage Was Killed on Oct. 7, Her Family Says appeared first on New York Times .",

    "title": "B.C. odour incidents spark questions around corporate ethics and communication",
    "text": "Vancouver resident Robert Ford was heading to a yoga class Sunday morning when he smelled an odour he likened to \"semi-burnt fuel.\"\nAs a member of council at his Kitsilano apartment building, he said he decided to check the boiler room, but it smelled fine.\n\"I was expecting something in there, so that was strange. I scratched my head and I went to the front door, which is right across from the beach, and it was 10 times more powerful outside,\" he said.\nHe immediately began searching online for an explanation but didn't find any answers until almost four hours later.\n\"I'm just kind of perplexed at how we can have such a nasty event with no public information hardly,\" he said.\nIt was one of two acrid odours that spread over parts of Metro Vancouver in less than a week, raising questions about corporate responsibility to inform the public when such events cause widespread concern and confusion but fall short of health and safety breaches.\nThe smell Ford referred to was revealed to be \"an unplanned issue\" with a Parkland fuel refinery processing unit in neighbouring Burnaby. The heavy stench, which Ford compared to jet fuel, blanketed parts of Metro Vancouver and caused more than 100 complaints from local residents.\nIt came just days after a gas leak from a FortisBC natural gas plant in nearby Delta, B.C., prompted criticisms from Mayor George Harvie and numerous residents that the utility didn't notify the public for more than four hours.\nHarvie said the heavy odour caused stress and panic in the community, and a flood of calls to local police and fire departments hampered Delta's emergency response services.\nA statement from Fortis said it was investigating after an elevated level of the odorant added to natural gas was unknowingly sent out in a controlled release of gas.\nCarol Liao, a University of B.C. Sauder fellow at the Dhillon centre for business ethics, said these incidents are not necessarily matters for legislation, but rather about accountability and ethics.\n\"Businesses obviously need to obey bylaws, but they also need to understand that beyond that, there is a need to act responsibly to maintain public trust,\" she said.\n\"If a business is the cause of a terrible odour that's impacting the surrounding community and beyond, it should act as a good corporate citizen and own up to the problem right away, alert public officials, alert those possibly impacted and in harm's way, mitigate the damage and be accountable.\"\nHarvie said he was involved in both incidents as Delta's mayor and as chair of Metro Vancouver's regional district.\n\"The difference between the two was (in) Metro Vancouver, air quality inspectors were on scene at the refinery, so we had more accurate information being fed back to us,\" he said.\nMetro Vancouver monitors emissions of particulates, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide from the Parkland refinery, and the district has said air quality objectives for the contaminants weren't exceeded Sunday.\nBut, Harvie said the Fortis incident was different.\n\"The one from Fortis was very disturbing to me and it does speak a lot about corporate values (and) corporate responsibilities. They kept the information away from us,\" he said. \"This was just unacceptable.\"\nHarvie took to the social media site X after the smell covered an area stretching from the Tsawwassen ferry terminal to more than 30 kilometres away in Vancouver. The mayor said he had contacted FortisBC requesting an urgent followup meeting.\nThe Fortis statement released on Wednesday said work was being performed on new equipment, which was not connected to the gas system, and while a controlled release of gas was planned, the release of odour was not.\n\"Further review is underway to determine why there was an elevated level of odorant in the equipment,\" it said.\n\"Although the controlled release of gas at the interconnect station on Jan. 16 contained an elevated level of this odorant, it is not harmful and there are no immediate or long-term health effects.\"\nFortis said it had been in contact with local First Nations, municipal and emergency officials, including Harvie, as well as government regulators, to provide information on its response.\n\"We have also started a review of the incident and are working with relevant stakeholders during this process.\"\nKevin Farrow, technical director of Parkland, said in an interview that the refinery had paused processing operations earlier this month due to extreme cold weather.\n\"It was during that restart of the refinery, that one of the processing units had a plugged line, which ultimately led to the plume and odour that many experienced on Sunday,\" he said. \"We've launched a review to better understand the root cause of what happened and how we got into this situation.\"\nParkland had issued an advisory on its website two days before the plume, alerting people who live nearby that they may notice noise and \"higher than usual flare\" from the facility.\nIn a timeline created by the refinery and sent to The Canadian Press, the company said the incident happened around 7:30 a.m. Sunday.\nIt said Metro Vancouver had been notified by 8:30 a.m., and by 9 a.m., the Burnaby Fire Department and the RCMP had created a perimeter around the facility as a safety precaution. The RCMP was called off at 11:26 a.m., while the fire department remained in place until 3:15 p.m., the timeline said.\nThe refinery's first public statement Sunday was issued at 11 a.m., notifying the public of an incident that cause elevated smoke, odours and particulate matter. That was followed up at 12:30 p.m. with a media advisory, announcing the shut down of operations.\nWhile some, including Ford in Kitsilano, believe communication needs to come sooner to alleviate panic, Farrow said the \"priority\" of the refinery is to \"communicate accurate and confirmed information to the public.\"\n\"We have that information now,\" he said. \"We understand more, and we've begun to reach out to our community partners and to our neighbours, (and) you can expect a lot more information from the refinery in the coming days and weeks.\"\nFarrow noted the refinery remains shut down but the company announced it would be conducting a \"controlled and necessary operational procedure\" on Thursday.\n\"We do not expect any impacts of the community. We're just making them aware, just in case anything were to occur,\" Farrow said.\nMetro Vancouver also issued an updated air quality bulletin Wednesday night, saying it \"will be closely monitoring\" as the refinery conducts the operation \"that may result in odour, smoke and flaring.\"\nWhile some residents expressed concern about the announcement online, Liao applauded the move, saying an advanced public statement can be \"immensely helpful in ensuring transparency and accountability to the surrounding communities.\"\n\"It helps avoid any public confusion and the tying up of resources such as 911 calls, while also mitigating risk,\" she said.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 25, 2024.\nBrieanna Charlebois, The Canadian Press",

In the south the 20 degree mark is even broken.\nThe weather forecast for the next six days.\nThere is one major event in particular to watch out for this weekend: the C/2023 A3 Tsuchinshan-ATLAS comet.

Then you will find all important information about it here.\nThis is how the weekend will be Unfortunately, weather-wise, the weekend is more suitable for indoor activities. “From tomorrow, Saturday to Monday, clouds will dominate in the north; tomorrow, Saturday, there will be some fog in the Lowlands,” wrote MeteoNews. On Saturday, a water front will run through Switzerland from west to east, so it may be wet in many places.\nBut now for the good news: The sun will return later on Sunday. The weather models still do not give a clear picture for the beginning of next week, but it is likely that fog and sun will come again then. Due to a south facing trough over western Europe, there is a good chance of some sunshine.\nGood news for next week: A trough over western Europe is bringing very mild air masses to Switzerland.

By the middle of the week, foehn winds and a possible 25 degrees will attract people to the Alpine valleys.

    "text": "Repórter de agro e macroeconomia Publicado em 13 de junho de 2024 às 17h15. O Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) suspendeu nesta quinta-feira, 13, o julgamento que decidia sobre a constitucionalidade de reduções e isenções de impostos concedidos para os agrotóxicos. Para o relator, o ministro Edson Fachin, uma audiência pública deve ser realizada para discutir de forma aprofundada o tema. A ação foi apresentada pelo PSOL em 2016. O partido questionou um convênio de 1997 do Conselho Nacional de Política Fazendária (Confaz) que reduziu em 60% o ICMS que incide sobre agrotóxicos, além de um decreto de 2011 — posteriormente revogado — que zerou o Imposto sobre Produtos Industrializados (IPI) que incide sobre parte dos produtos. Andamento do processo Oito ministros já votaram. O relator, ministro Edson Fachin, votou pela procedência do pedido. O ministro considerou que a utilização de agrotóxicos acarreta \"riscos à saúde humana e ao equilíbrio da fauna e da flora\", e que por isso não devem receber benefícios fiscais. Fachin foi acompanhado por Cármen Lúcia. Gilmar Mendes abriu a divergência e defendeu que a ação seja rejeitada. Ao contrário de Fachin, Gilmar avaliou que a isenção \"não viola o direito à saúde ou ao meio ambiente equilibrado\", por considerar que há um \"minucioso regramento\" para liberar os produtos e que o benefício diminui o preço dos alimentos. Ele foi acompanhado pelos ministros Cristiano Zanin, Dias Toffoli e Alexandre de Moraes. Já o ministro André Mendonça abriu uma terceira posição. Mendonça considera que há um \"processo de inconstitucionalização\", mas, ao invés de invalidar as medidas, defendeu que o governo federal e os estados devem realizar, no prazo de 90 dias, uma reavaliação da política. Flávio Dino seguiu essa posição. Apesar de já ter votado, Mendonça pediu destaque, o que levou o julgamento ao plenário físico. Os ministros podem optar por repetirem os votos apresentados no ambiente virtual ou mudar de posição. Com informações da Agência O Globo",

    "text": "Storm-tossed Lido Beach to be widened with a little federal help\nThe rebuilding of Sarasota's Lido Beach's storm-damaged sand dunes will also take place next year.\nWhile Pinellas County residents will have to pay out of their own pockets for new sand on their beaches, the federal government is picking up the tab for a similar project in Sarasota.\nThe city of Sarasota will begin a renourishment of 1.2 miles of Lido Beach, which suffered significant erosion from last year's hurricanes.\nBut unlike Pinellas, the Army Corps of Engineers will pay for the $12 million project to deposit 200,000 to 300,000 cubic yards of sand dredged from New Pass.\nPinellas' plans have been stymied by a new Army Corps rule that every beachfront property owner has to agree to a permanent easement for the project to begin.\nBut city of Sarasota spokeswoman Jan Thornburg said the city received all easements that were required by the Army Corps in 2021. This is the second renourishment of Lido Beach paid for by the Army Corps.\n\"The city has a long-standing agreement with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for Lido Beach renourishment every five years,\" she said. \"The city of Sarasota secured the necessary easements for the initial renourishment project with the (Army Corps) in 2021. Those easements remain in effect and continue to authorize access for both the beach berm and dune system, including access for future maintenance and storm risk management work.\"\nThe beach will remain open during the project, which is expected to last from this fall until spring of 2026.\nNew sand dunes will also be built next year. That will include a new vegetated dune system extending from the Lido Beach Pavilion to residential properties to the south.\nThe city got $12 million in disaster relief funds from the Corps after multiple hurricanes since 2021: $8 million in 2022, and an additional $4 million in 2025 to address the increased project costs from inflation and evolving designs.\n“The renourishment of Lido Beach will not only improve the area for residents and visitors but also increase the resiliency of our coastal community,” said Mayor Liz Alpert, in a prepared statement. “We thank our local, state, and federal partners for working alongside us in fortifying Lido Beach against sea level rise, tropical weather, and future climate impacts.”",
