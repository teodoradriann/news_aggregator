There was a couple of vehicles – one parked up.\n“You couldn’t see the (other) vehicle. It was 3ft beneath the water.\n“I helped get it out on to the riverbank with three other tractors.”\nTwo other locals, Rosie and Andrew Dale, said they were with Mr Ford when he got the call to help.\nThey said they saw several 4×4 vehicles pass their home in the direction of the ford shortly before the incident.\nMrs Dale said “nobody local” would attempt to cross the ford in the current conditions.\nThe area is popular with 4×4 drivers, she said, adding: “In the summer you get 10 of them at a time.”\nNUMBERPLATE PIXELLATED BY PA PICTURE DESK AT REQUEST OF NORTH YORKSHIRE POLICE The recovered vehicle being removed from the River Esk (Danny Lawson/PA) A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: “Localised conditions across our area are making driving hazardous.\n“Roads are particularly badly affected around the River Esk, to the north of the county, as we have seen with the tragic incident near Glaisdale.\n“There was another incident at nearby Houlsyke at 12.49pm when a car got stuck in flood water and another at Kirby Wiske in Hambleton at 2.35pm.\n“Thankfully, the occupants of both vehicles were brought to safety.\n“The key advice is to consider whether your journey is necessary.\n“Please avoid driving through any kind of standing or moving flood water if you possibly can.”\nWitnesses to the incident at Glaisdale are urged to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, option 4, quoting reference NYP-28122023-0146.",

Oggi è un punto di riferimento della nuova tecnologia: annunciato un nuovo superchip fatto in casa per intelligenza artificiale. Dopo un rialzo del 50% dall’inizio dell’anno, il titolo non è caro. Nuovo chip e nuove funzioni di Instagram Chi si ricorda più del Metaverso? Per chi possiede azioni Meta da lungo tempo, quel nome corrisponde a un incubo che nel novembre del 2022 (un anno e mezzo fa) aveva affossato le azioni fino a una quotazione di 90 dollari, il minimo degli ultimi otto anni. Sicuramente nella mente del fondatore e Ceo Mark Zuckerberg il Metaverso continua a essere un sogno da realizzare, ma nel frattempo ha saputo fare un’incredibile inversione a U e indirizzare tutte le energie dell’azienda sull’intelligenza artificiale. Mercoledì 10 aprile Meta ha presentato un nuovo chip per i carichi di lavoro dell'intelligenza artificiale, in particolare per alimentare i modelli pubblicitari di ranking e raccomandazioni dell'azienda. Il chip è la seconda generazione di un precedente chip chiamato MTIA, acronimo di Meta Training and Inference Accelerator. Il primo chip MTIA ha fatto il suo debutto nel 2023. Sempre mercoledì Meta ha annunciato che, grazie all’intelligenza artificiale, Instagram sta mettendo a punto alcune funzioni per offuscare messaggi contenenti nudità allo scopo di salvaguardare gli adolescenti e impedire che potenziali truffatori li raggiungano. Pronto un nuovo modello di AI capace di ragionare Infine, secondo un articolo di ieri del Financial Times, Meta è sul punto di rilasciare un nuovo modello di intelligenza artificiale che sarebbe in grado di ragionare e pianificare: “passi fondamentali per raggiungere una cognizione sovrumana nelle macchine”. Nell’immediato l’attenzione degli analisti è stata catturata dall’annuncio del nuovo chip, arrivato il giorno dopo analoghe comunicazioni da parte di Intel (NASDAQ: Mentre Nvidia rimane il protagonista dominante del mercato, i fornitori di cloud computing come Amazon (NASDAQ: In 18 mesi le azioni Meta sono salite del 490% Tempo fa Zuckerberg aveva annunciato che Meta arriverà ad avere 350.000 chip Nvidia H100 funzionanti nei suoi data center entro la fine del 2024. Per Meta, MTIA è un'integrazione, non una sostituzione, dei chip di Nvidia. La nuova versione di MTIA raddoppia la larghezza di banda di calcolo e di memoria rispetto alla versione originale del chip. Il nuovo chip sarà prodotto da Taiwan Semiconductor. Sulla spinta dell’impegno nell’intelligenza artificiale, Meta ha messo a segno nell’ultimo anno e mezzo uno dei più favolosi rialzi di Wall Street (+490%). Dall’inizio dell’anno il titolo è salito del 50% e lo scorso 8 aprile ha segnato il nuovo massimo storico a 531 dollari. Oggi su 59 analisti che coprono Meta ben 50 raccomandano di comprare le azioni, ma ormai le quotazioni hanno raggiunto il target price medio (530 dollari). Stime e multipli: perché le quotazioni possono salire ancora Il 23 aprile la società comunicherà i risultati del primo trimestre, con il consensus che si aspetta una crescita dei ricavi a 36,1 miliardi di dollari (+26% sullo stesso periodo del 2023) e il raddoppio dell’utile a 11,2 miliardi. L’intero esercizio 2024, secondo le previsioni degli analisti, dovrebbe chiudersi con un utile in crescita del 33% a 52 miliardi di dollari, pari al 33% dei ricavi. Con stime di questo tipo non si può dire che la quotazione attuale (520 dollari) sia elevata: oggi Meta capitalizza 1.330 miliardi di dollari, che equivale a 26 volte gli utili attesi per l’intero 2024.

Il chip è la seconda generazione di un precedente chip chiamato MTIA, acronimo di Meta Training and Inference Accelerator. Il primo chip MTIA ha fatto il suo debutto nel 2023. Sempre mercoledì Meta ha annunciato che, grazie all’intelligenza artificiale, Instagram sta mettendo a punto alcune funzioni per offuscare messaggi contenenti nudità allo scopo di salvaguardare gli adolescenti e impedire che potenziali truffatori li raggiungano. Pronto un nuovo modello di AI capace di ragionare Infine, secondo un articolo di ieri del Financial Times, Meta è sul punto di rilasciare un nuovo modello di intelligenza artificiale che sarebbe in grado di ragionare e pianificare: “passi fondamentali per raggiungere una cognizione sovrumana nelle macchine”. Nell’immediato l’attenzione degli analisti è stata catturata dall’annuncio del nuovo chip, arrivato il giorno dopo analoghe comunicazioni da parte di Intel (NASDAQ: [INTC](/equities/intel-corp)) e Alphabet (NASDAQ: [GOOGL](/equities/google-inc)). Mentre Nvidia rimane il protagonista dominante del mercato, i fornitori di cloud computing come Amazon (NASDAQ: [AMZN](/equities/amazon-com-inc)), Google e Meta stanno progettando sempre più spesso i propri chip per integrare le unità di elaborazione grafica (GPU) di Nvidia e, in alcuni casi, per fornire alternative meno costose. In 18 mesi le azioni Meta sono salite del 490% Tempo fa Zuckerberg aveva annunciato che Meta arriverà ad avere 350.000 chip Nvidia H100 funzionanti nei suoi data center entro la fine del 2024. Per Meta, MTIA è un'integrazione, non una sostituzione, dei chip di Nvidia. La nuova versione di MTIA raddoppia la larghezza di banda di calcolo e di memoria rispetto alla versione originale del chip. Il nuovo chip sarà prodotto da Taiwan Semiconductor. Sulla spinta dell’impegno nell’intelligenza artificiale, Meta ha messo a segno nell’ultimo anno e mezzo uno dei più favolosi rialzi di Wall Street (+490%). Dall’inizio dell’anno il titolo è salito del 50% e lo scorso 8 aprile ha segnato il nuovo massimo storico a 531 dollari. Oggi su 59 analisti che coprono Meta ben 50 raccomandano di comprare le azioni, ma ormai le quotazioni hanno raggiunto il target price medio (530 dollari). Stime e multipli: perché le quotazioni possono salire ancora Il 23 aprile la società comunicherà i risultati del primo trimestre, con il consensus che si aspetta una crescita dei ricavi a 36,1 miliardi di dollari (+26% sullo stesso periodo del 2023) e il raddoppio dell’utile a 11,2 miliardi. L’intero esercizio 2024, secondo le previsioni degli analisti, dovrebbe chiudersi con un utile in crescita del 33% a 52 miliardi di dollari, pari al 33% dei ricavi. Con stime di questo tipo non si può dire che la quotazione attuale (520 dollari) sia elevata: oggi Meta capitalizza 1.330 miliardi di dollari, che equivale a 26 volte gli utili attesi per l’intero 2024.

    "text": "In a pivotal moment that shaped his presidential campaign, John F. Kennedy delivered a powerful and eloquent speech before the Houston Ministerial Association on September 12, 1960. This speech, widely regarded as a defining moment in American political history, showcased Kennedy’s unwavering commitment to the separation of church and state and his belief in the fundamental principles of religious freedom. Kennedy’s address was a direct response to concerns raised by some religious leaders who questioned his ability to separate his personal Catholic faith from his political decision-making. In a nation where the majority of citizens identified as Protestant, Kennedy’s Catholicism was seen by some as a potential threat to the separation of church and state. With his characteristic charisma and eloquence, Kennedy confronted these concerns head-on. He began his speech by acknowledging the importance of religion in American society, stating that it was “the source of strength and guidance in our lives.” However, he emphasized that the role of government was not to establish a state religion or favor one faith over another. Kennedy’s speech was a masterclass in political rhetoric. He deftly navigated the complex intersection of religion and politics, assuring his audience that his personal religious beliefs would not influence his decisions as president. He drew upon the nation’s founding principles, citing the First Amendment’s guarantee of religious freedom, and emphasized that the United States was a nation where “religion is a private matter for each individual.” Kennedy’s speech resonated deeply with the American public, transcending religious and political divides. His unwavering commitment to religious freedom and his ability to articulate a clear separation between church and state solidified his position as a leader who respected and upheld the constitutional rights of all citizens. The Houston Ministerial Association speech remains a shining example of Kennedy’s political acumen and his dedication to the principles of religious freedom. It is a speech that continues to inspire and educate, serving as a reminder of the importance of upholding the separation of church and state in a diverse and pluralistic society.",
