Это вызвало негодование у жильцов — они попытались задержать оператора, однако тот повел себя неадекватно, проявил агрессию и скрылся с места происшествия.\n— Это реальное вторжение в личную жизнь. Мы боимся, что эти кадры могут оказаться в интернете, — заявила одна из жительниц дома.\nОтметим, что это далеко не первый случай в столице. Ранее горожане сообщали о том, что их жилье снимают с воздуха, якобы с целью поиска «пикантных» кадров и компрометирующего видео. Подобные действия грубо нарушают право на частную жизнь и вызывают справедливое беспокойство.\nЖители требуют от МВД Кыргызстана обратить внимание на участившиеся случаи несанкционированной съемки с дронов, особенно в жилых зонах.\nВы можете сообщить новость, отправив ее в WhatsApp и Telegram по номеру 0555312024.",

    "title": "Young American couple, killed by armed gangs in Haiti, devoted lives to missionary work | American Military News",
    "text": "A young American couple who devoted their lives to missionary work in Haiti were killed Thursday night, along with the Haitian director of their non-profit, after two armed groups attacked their mission in the country’s volatile capital. “I’m just at a total loss,” David Lloyd, 48, told the Miami Herald, confirming the deaths of his son Davy Lloyd, daughter-in-law Natalie Lloyd and director Jude Montis. “I’m just in total shock. I haven’t grieved. I haven’t done anything else. I haven’t eaten. I can’t think.” The three were killed by armed gunmen who attacked Missions In Hope, a U.S.-based non-profit near Bon Repos, a gang-controlled community just east of the capital. The details of what happened were still not clear Friday, said Lloyd, who had flown out of Port-au-Prince with his other son the day before the attack. But the non-profit was hit by two different armed groups during the day, he said. Davy Lloyd was trying to inform his dad about what was happening on the property when the three were killed and their bodies set on fire. Missions in Hope runs a school for 450 children, has a children’s home and a commercial bakery, where Lloyd said “we give bread to anyone who’s hungry.” “We haven’t had any problems,” he said. “We’ve operated school every day. We’ve had church on schedule. We got a commercial bakery that’s open every day. I’ve never had been asked for any money to operate or stay open. I’ve never had any issues.” On Thursday Davy, 23, and Natalie, 21, were ambushed by armed gunmen belonging to the Terre Nwa (Black Soil) gang. The ambush happened on a day on which many Haitians had anticipated a deployment of Kenyan police officers. Terre Nwa is led by one of the thousands of inmates who recently escaped after armed groups stormed the country’s two largest prisons on March 2. Based in the area of Sarthe, the Terre Nwa gang is led by a man who goes by the name “Jones,” according to a Haiti police source. Armed gang members came onto the mission’s property just as Natalie and Davy were coming out of church with several youths. “They drove him into the house, tied him up and beat him,” Lloyd said. “Then they proceeded to loot the whole house, everything they wanted and took my trucks and drove off with them.” After the gang left, the staff and children untied Davy and he headed to his parents’ house on the property to call his dad. On the way to the house, he and Natalie met up with Montis, the director who has been with the nonprofit for 20 years, and others who had stepped outside to see what had happened. “All of a sudden there was this immense panic. Everybody started running,” David Lloyd said. “The kids ran around back, put ladders up and climbed over the wall.” Suddenly the place was invaded with more men with guns, members of another gang in nearby Canaan, controlled by man identified as “Jeff.” “I was on the phone with my son when that was going down. He said, ‘Dad, we got a commotion again. I’ve got to go see what’s going on,” Lloyd said. Lloyd said he has heard after the second gang arrived a gang member was shot and mayhem broke out. Davy, Natalie and Jude were all barricaded inside his parents’ home on the property. “They eventually got into the house and killed all three of them and set their bodies on fire,” Lloyd said. He said he is trying to get the bodies to have them sent to a morgue. David Lloyd and his wife, Alicia Lloyd, founded Missions in Haiti in 2000. Davy grew up in Haiti, his father said. “Creole is his first language and Haiti has his heart.” David Lloyd recalled that when Davy left Haiti after high school for bible college in the U.S., “he told basically all the girls there, ‘Don’t even talk to me if you’re not willing to live in Haiti the rest of your life, cause that’s my home.” Natalie Baker, whose father is a state lawmaker in the House of Representatives in Missouri, was willing to spend her life in the Caribbean country. The two got married two years ago and moved back to Haiti full-time. Natalie’s father, state Rep. Ben Baker, a Republican, shared the news about the couple’s death on his Facebook page. “My heart is broken in a thousand pieces. I’ve never felt this kind of pain. Most of you know my daughter and son-in-law Davy and Natalie Lloyd are full time missionaries in Haiti. They were attacked by gangs this evening and were both killed,” Baker wrote. “They went to Heaven together. Please pray for my family we desperately need strength. And please pray for the Lloyd family. I have no other words for now.” The deaths have the missionary community reeling. Though some missionaries have left after the State Department warned U.S. citizens to leave the country, others have remained in Haiti, where an impending deployment of police officers from Kenya to help lead a multinational security support mission has been pushed back after an assessment team from Nairobi found critical equipment shortages. The assessment team, which has a meeting with the United Nations political office in Haiti on Friday, is scheduled to fly out on Saturday and head back to Nairobi.",

    "text": "(ANSA) – ROME, NOV 14 – “We had reported it several times and today the confirmation arrived: the Meloni government’s rules on hunting were in open violation of European rules and this could cost our country dearly. The European Commission has in fact communicated that it had sent a reasoned opinion to Italy for failing to comply with the Birds Directive and the Reach Regulation . The EU accuses the Meloni government of having granted the Regions the power to authorize the killing or capture of wildlife species. during the time of year and in areas such as protected areas where hunting is prohibited, in breach of the Birds Directive.” The parliamentarians of the 5 Star Movement, members of the Planet 2050 Committee, Sergio Costa, Alessandro Caramiello, Carmen Di Lauro, Ilaria Fontana and Gisella Naturale wrote this in a note.\n“In the same way – they add – the Commission underlines that the Italian legislation on hunting does not comply with the provisions of the modified Reach regulation on the use of lead in firearms. Therefore, the letter of formal notice sent by the EU was not enough in February, nor have our countless public complaints helped.”\n“The government – they continue – has continued on its path aimed at deregulating hunting, it has continued its journey of transforming Italy into the Far West. A crazy conduct, which puts our country on a collision course with the Commission, which now could decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union. And the sword of Damocles of the infringement procedure always hangs over our future.\nMeloni, Lollobrigida and the entire government, in short, expose Italy to an international fool and our citizens to sanctions that will weigh directly on their pockets”.

But after business boomed, Chappell's part of the Spirals family, Festler says. [Anthony Robledo](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7612431001/anthony-robledo/) An Oklahoma hot dog joint owner visibly wanted customers one day and he soon got more than he bargained for. During a slow shift on Dec. 20, a customer took a photo of Scott Festler standing by his restaurant entrance waiting for diners and shared it on social media. Festler would soon have no time to stand around as \" [Spirals: Hot Dogs & More](https://spiralshotdogs.com/),\" in Norman, Oklahoma, saw booming business once the post went viral. \"We immediately started doing double digits in sales,\" Festler told USA TODAY on Thursday. \"It happened really fast to me.\" The day the photo was taken, Festler found himself staring out the window upset his family business of four years wasn't booming as well as others ahead of Christmas. Festler said he had no idea why Spirals saw a sudden wave of new customers after Dec. 20 until the person responsible for posting the photo, Nick Chappell, later apologized and offered to take the post down. Festler wouldn't hear of it. \"You just wouldn't expect it. Social media is amazing. It's amazing that people get involved with it,\" he said. \"But more importantly, it's the stuff that you just don't think would work. That's what works.\" 'I will always love you': [See Dolly Parton grant Utah man's dying wish to meet her](/story/life/humankind/2023/12/26/dolly-parton-meets-longtime-fan/72033945007/) Customer knew he had to capture 'wholesome moment' Chappell visited the Norman area for his job as an Oklahoma Army National Guard. As part of their weekly hot dog Wednesday routine, Chappell and a his co-worker found Spirals on Google Maps and took a chance. Noticing Festler gazing, Chappell decided to capture the \"wholesome moment\" on Snapchat captioning \"He has been standing here waiting on customers to come in.\" \"A good buddy of mine named Chad said, 'Hey, man, you can either post this on Facebook or I'm going to post this on Facebook. Some way or another we're going to get this guy some customers,'\" Chappell said. In a Facebook post, Chappell gave an excellent recommendation of the restaurant, complimenting their food and \"off the charts\" service. He shared a photo of his dish, the menu and of Festler waiting for diners. Chappell was blown away by the success of the post, which has since had over 2,000 shares, and even more surprised to see over 70 guests at the diner during his next visit. \"I'm not a huge social media guy I typically don't share,\" Chappell said. \"I don't even know really the words to describe it as but it made me even that much happier that I did make a post.\" Owner adds new 'Thunderbird' item in customer's honor Festler is showing his gratitude by adding a new item in Chappell's honor. Having named hot dogs and bowls after family members, he was more than happy to do so. The \"Thunderbird\" is a hot link with bacon, cream cheese and jalapeños, Festler said. The meal gets its name from the Thunderbird Unit Patch for the 45th Infantry, which Chappell is a part of. The two reconnected at the restaurant on Thursday, where they both got emotional talking about the post's impact. Chappell received a certificate of appreciation during the unveiling of the \"Thunderbird\" and was told he is now forever part of the Spirals family. \"To know that it was a humble guy that just saw our need and did what he could. He doesn’t have a real following on social media, he hardly ever shares anything and to know that one post had so much power. It was super cool,\" Festler added.",

    "text": "ADVERTISEMENT Just as ‘House of the Dragon’ returned to our screens after its first season two years ago this June, the other major 2022 fantasy show ‘The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power’ is now back for its second offering.\nWhile the wait for the second ‘House of the Dragon’ season was an agonising for fans, the watching experience itself of the first ‘Rings of Power’ season that was unfortunately equally painful.\nRelated The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power - Is it worth watching the most expensive TV series ever? Why is 'House of the Dragon' getting review bombed by Saudi Arabia? Over eight episodes, the show lumbered through the history of Middle Earth in the Second Age, thousands of years before the events of the beloved original J.R.R. Tolkien trilogy.\nFor all the billions that Jeff Bezos was willing to throw at the project to bring the ‘Lord of the Rings’ intellectual property within Amazon’s coffers, little effort was made to craft an engaging dramatic story for viewers to care about.\nFrom a first glance at the opening episode of season 2, the same issue with the first prevails. Once again, clear dramatic arcs, empathetic characters, and sharp dialogue have been placed second to glitzy visuals and deep lore dives.\nRight from the off, we have a flashback on how Sauron ended up on that raft in the ocean at the beginning of the first season. It’s the sort of deep-dive question that only a fan would care to know about. The first season’s obsession with Sauron’s origin – a topic uninteresting to fans of the films and inconsistent to fans of the books – didn’t need these tiny details. Nor did it need to have a confusing cameo by Jack Lowden as Sauron to kick off the season with viewers questioning whether season one actor Charlie Vickers had been cancelled.\nCharlie Vickers as Sauron Amazon Prime Video We quickly come back to the present tense (thousands of years before Frodo) and Galadriel is arguing with Elrond about whether the rings that they forged with Sauron – before they knew he was a wrong’un – should still be used for their intended purpose of rectifying the trend of diminishing magic in Middle Earth.\nIt’s in these exchanges where my problem with the first episode comes into greatest clarity. The elves speak with certainty about the importance of doing whatever is necessary to save Middle Earth. To them, deliberating over whether these rings are their saviours or contain their doom is of grave importance.\nBut all of this presupposes the importance to us, the viewers of ‘Rings of Power’. It’s been two years since the overly complex barely interweaving strands of the first season’s plots calcified into forming the supposedly serious stakes: Orcs are rising, Mordor has been created, and Sauron is back.\nCould it be magic? The average viewer can barely remember the details of the plodding first season, beleaguered by characters asserting the importance of topics without selling it through their actions or personalities. As these glossy elves debate the virtues of these rings, they’ve assumed we care about the fate of Middle Earth at all.\nPeter Jackson’s original trilogy built a massive fanbase for Middle Earth on top of the legion of fantasy lovers familiar with Tolkien’s books. Most viewers will care about a Middle Earth, just not this one. Every character in this show speaks with ceremonial importance but there’s no levity, no grand heroics, and no personality for us to latch onto as we did with Jackson’s films.\nThe mistake ‘Rings of Power’ routinely makes is assuming that because viewers spent nine-plus hours in Jackson’s world, we should be as invested in Amazon’s one.\nRobert Aramayo as Elrond Amazon Prime Video Beyond the elves, the first episode also reacquainted us with the Harefoots and Gandalf – except he’s not Gandalf, but he clearly is – on their journey… somewhere. Even with the extended reminder at the beginning of the episode, the sheer number of season one’s plotlines all without clear narrative trajectory makes this hard to keep up with.\nOn the bright side, now Gandalf-not-Gandalf is fully talking and Daniel Weyman is doing his best Ian McKellen impression while the Harefoots continue to be cutesy, if superfluous, Hobbit stand-ins.\nIt does all look excellent at least. The roughly $150 million (€135 million) that each season of this show costs doesn’t go to waste. Location shooting and top-notch CGI make this look as much the high-budget take on Middle Earth Bezos hoped for. From the idyllic wanderings of Gandalf (sorry, the Stranger) in the countryside to the Orc scenes providing a level of grime and grit, this is a fully realised vision of the fantasy world’s Second Age.\nADVERTISEMENT Additionally, from the preview of the rest of season two, it looks like the show may gain some momentum. Big battles are coming for the fate of Middle Earth as Sauron grows in strength, giving rings out to any willing passer-by. We also will get to catch up with whatever is happening in Númenor and to the loveable dwarf couple ostracised from their kingdom.\nThe first season also improved as it went on, as the interminable place-setting was replaced by bombastic set pieces. If the show can manage to make us care by the time the same shift occurs over the next seven episodes, we might just get the exciting ‘Lord of the Rings’ show Bezos always fantasised about.\nShare this article Comments You might also like Now playing Next Culture news The Hunt for Gollum: Do we need another LOTR film?

    "text": "El Gobierno nacional solicitó acelerar la salida del embajador de EE. UU., Marc Ostfield, a través de una conferencia de prensa. El diputado Rodrigo Gamarra manifestó para La Nación/Nación Media que esto se elabora bajo un principio inviolable de nuestro país: la soberanía. “La reciente solicitud de la Cancillería y de la Presidencia de la República para el retiro inmediato del embajador norteamericano no es solo un acto protocolar, sino también una respuesta necesaria y justificada ante una serie de graves incidentes de intromisión en nuestros asuntos internos”, indicó. El parlamentario señaló que el embajador ha cruzado repetidamente los límites de lo que establece la Convención de Viena sobre Relaciones Diplomáticas, violando artículos que obligan a todo agente diplomático a respetar las leyes del país receptor y abstenerse de interferir en sus asuntos internos. “A lo largo de su gestión, ha irrumpido en políticas públicas, ingresado en oficinas estatales sin autorización, y presionado a nuestras autoridades judiciales para que se alineen con los intereses extranjeros, entre otras graves faltas”, sentenció.

No obstante, puntualizó que con el comunicado elaborado no se busca dañar las relaciones con EE. UU. “Este tipo de medidas son necesarias para evitar cualquier quiebre o inconveniente en esa relación. Este pedido tiene como objetivo preservar y fortalecer esos lazos de respeto mutuo, asegurando que nuestras naciones continúen colaborando sobre la base de la igualdad y la no injerencia”, subrayó. Resaltó cómo Paraguay observa al país norteamericano como un país hermano, aparte de valorar profundamente su relación con el pueblo estadounidense. “Es precisamente por eso que este tipo de acciones son esenciales para mantener la confianza y la cooperación entre ambos países”, afirmó.
