    "text": "CONLEY COMMENTARY (WSAU) – It is Good Friday, the day Jesus Christ went to the cross for you and for me.\nRadio commentator Paul Harvey used to tell a story similar to this. Today I am paraphrasing.\nA minister walked into church to give his Good Friday sermon. He arrived holding an old, rusty birdcage. The cage door was open. It was empty.\n“I want to tell you how I got this birdcage,” he told the congregation.\n“I was walking to church this morning, when I came across a boy in an alley just a few blocks from here. This birdcage was filled with a dozen or so field birds. I could tell he was up to some kind of mischief. So I asked him, ‘what do you have there?’ And he said ‘I caught these birds behind my house.’\n‘And what are you going to do with them?’\n‘Oh, I’m gonna shake this cage and scare them. Then I’m going to kill them. I’ll either throw rocks at them, or feed them to my cat.’\n‘And I asked the boy, how much do you want for them?’\n‘He said, ‘Mister, these birds are worthless. They aren’t colorful. They don’t sing. They’re just field birds.’\n‘How much? I asked again.’\n‘And the boy said, ‘$5… no $10.’ So I reached into my pocket and gave him a ten dollar bill. He took the money and left the birds and the birdcage with me. And when he was out of sight, I opened the cage and let the birds free.’\nJesus was walking. And he came upon the devil holding a cage. It was full of human souls, not much different than yours or mine.\nJesus asked, ‘what are you going to do with them?’ And the evil one said ‘I’m going to tormet them, and scare them, and watch them turn on one another. And them I’m going to kill them and take them into hell with me for all eternity.’\nAnd Jesus asked, ‘how much do you want for them?’\nSatan said, ‘They’re worthless. They sin, and disobey, and do evil over and over again. They can’t be taught. They’re wicked.’\nJesus asked again, ‘how much?’\nAnd the devil named the price: ‘All of your… blood.’\nToday is Good Friday. It is the day the Jesus Christ poured out his blood so that you, and I, might be freed from our sins.\nThanks be to God.\nChris Conley",

    "text": "EAST LANSING, Mich. — Year after year, the market for good hay in Michigan outstrips supply, leading to dependable prices for hay growers who put in the time it takes to manage this demanding crop. Recent market conditions let row crop growers see an opportunity to add a perennial hay rotation that is in demand and can provide its own nitrogen when alfalfa and clovers are included. Dairy, beef, sheep and goat producers and horse owners may want to grow their own forage so they have better control over supply and nutritional quality. However, hay is a challenging crop that is not for everyone. As with any other agricultural enterprise, there are many things to learn. [Michigan State University Extension](https://www.canr.msu.edu/outreach/) is once again holding [Hay Production 101](https://events.anr.msu.edu/2024HayProduction101/), an online short course to help farmers interested in learning how to grow hay. The main objective of our team of MSU Extension specialists and educators is to assist newcomers to the world of hay, but there is value here also for those looking to improve an existing hay operation. Management recommendations will focus on the greater Michigan and Great Lakes region. This is an online course taught as six sessions using Zoom every Tuesday and Thursday evening from 7 to 8:30 p.m. beginning Feb. 27 through March 14, 2024. Sessions may be attended in real time and will also be recorded for future viewing by registrants. There will be plenty of opportunities to ask questions and interact with instructors in each live session. Topics covered will include: - Industry Overview - Planning to Meet Your Farm Goals: Forage Species and Varieties - Soil Fertility and Health Management - Hayfield Establishment and Renovation - Harvest Management - Post-harvest Processing and Storage - Pest Management: Weeds, Insects and Diseases - Cost of Production and Marketing The cost of the course is $85. Pre-registration is required in order to receive the session links.

    "title": "‘It’s improved my life’: Members of LGBTQ-friendly Catholic church discuss their belonging in religion",
    "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV) - Pride Month begins this weekend, but there are many places that promote LGBTQ Equality all year round. Including a local Catholic Church in Kansas City that wants to turn their message of unity and equality into action during June. At a time when many churches report smaller turnout, membership at the Christ the King Independent Catholic Church is holding steady as they continue to promote being a welcoming place no matter who you choose to love. Growing up in a small town in rural Kansas, Jenri Conley says she struggled to feel accepted for being a lesbian. “I felt like a bad Catholic just because of who I am and have gone through periods feeling a lot of anxiety,” expressed Jenri Conley, who attends Christ the King. “Since coming here it’s improved my life so much.” This Pride Month, Father Taylor Tracy , who’s openly gay, and his clergy are determined to reach more people like Jenri. “It’s all about meeting people where they’re at,” Father Tracy explained. “So rather than try to fix people it’s all about journeying and healing with them alongside them. These are all our sheep; these are the blood of children of God that have been ostracized through no fault of their own.” Throughout June, Christ the King will have booths at as many events as possible. Their goal they say is to show everyone your orientation doesn’t define your relationship with God. “God loves each and every one of us unconditionally without reservations,” Conley said. “Without exceptions. I think it’s important to flourish who you are and not try to please other people.” “This isn’t a gay church; this is the church and it’s a place where you are welcome unconditionally,” Father Tracy added. “You can come and raise children and receive the sacraments. We shouldn’t wait until we’re in heaven to build that community.” This year Christ the King Independent Catholic Community has a congregation of 125 each week. In August, they’re adding a second mass every Sunday to keep up with the growth. Copyright 2024 KCTV. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "La deputata di Manicouagan, Marilène Gill, auspica una soluzione rapida e negoziata del conflitto tra il governo federale e il sindacato dei lavoratori delle poste (CUPW).\nSecondo lei, il governo federale deve dar prova di leadership per raggiungere un accordo soddisfacente per tutte le parti e che consenta la ripresa del servizio postale, in particolare nelle regioni della North Shore dove Canada Post ha il monopolio.\n“Sostengo i nostri lavoratori del settore postale che hanno deciso di avvalersi di un diritto fondamentale, quello della contrattazione collettiva, nonché del diritto di sciopero ad esso connesso”, commenta.\n“Spero quindi che le loro lamentele vengano ascoltate e che le loro azioni portino a una soluzione rapida, per il loro benessere, ma anche a beneficio delle nostre imprese e delle nostre comunità di Manicouagan, dove Canada Post detiene il monopolio del servizio postale”, spiega La signora Gill.\nIl membro ricorda di sfuggita che già, in tempi normali, Canada Post “non riesce a offrire un servizio conveniente, affidabile e regolare a comunità come quelle della Lower North Shore”. Questi ultimi “dipendono interamente dall’azienda statale, sia per la consegna della posta ordinaria, ma anche per i beni di prima necessità come cibo o medicinali”, aggiunge.\nPer la signora Gill, è chiaro che l’impatto di questa interruzione del servizio da parte dell’azienda statale ha un impatto molto diverso per Fermont o Chevery rispetto ai centri urbani.\n“Il governo federale deve rassicurare le popolazioni isolate e settentrionali e mitigare le conseguenze di queste rotture. È sua responsabilità! », conclude in un comunicato.\nCanada",

    "text": "OCCUPIED JERUSALEM — Khalil Sayegh lives in the United States and for days he anxiously awaited news of his family who had taken refuge in Gaza churches to escape the Hamas-Israel war.\nA few days before Christmas, he learned his father had died due to a lack of medical care, Sayegh said by telephone from Washington DC where he works as a political analyst.\n\"I was told by a relative... who had learned it from a priest,\" he said.\nThe news left him feeling shattered, he said, adding that he has yet to speak with other relatives stuck in Gaza which has been under heavy Israeli bombardment since Hamas' October 7 sudden attacks.\nMobile and Internet services, as well as electricity, have been largely disrupted in the Palestinian territory since the war broke out.\n\"Days go by without us having any news,\" said Sayegh, 29.\n\"We live with fear... not knowing if they are dead or alive, if they have food and water or if they are hungry.\"\nSayegh's family — his parents, two sisters and a brother — are among the 1.9 million people the United Nations estimates have been displaced in the territory of 2.4 million.\nHis parents and one sister took shelter at the Catholic Holy Family Church in Gaza City, while his younger brother stayed in Khan Yunis as he needs kidney dialysis.\nHis other sister fled to the nearby Saint Porphyrius Greek Orthodox Church with her husband and two children. While there she gave birth to a third child, a boy named Khader.\n\"I haven't even seen a picture of him. All I know is that he exists,\" said Sayegh.\nAbout 7,000 Christians lived in Gaza before Hamas took control of the Palestinian territory in 2007, according to the Gaza authorities. Now they number around 1,000.\nThe Hamas government says more than 20,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched air strikes and a ground offensive. Most of the dead are women and children.\nThe war has reduced much of Gaza to rubble and put out of action most of its hospitals, particularly in the north of the territory, the United Nations says.\nFood, medicine, water and fuel are hard to come by.\n'Pray for us'\nThe Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem reported that on December 16 two Christian women were \"murdered\" by an Israeli forces sniper inside the same church where Sayegh's family are sheltering.\nPope Francis deplored the deaths, which he said happened in a church complex \"where there are no terrorists but families, children, people who are sick and have disabilities\".\nBack in Washington, Gaza-born Sayegh said he has put on hold studies he was undertaking in the field of human rights.\n\"I just cannot function 100 per cent,\" he said.\n\"The only thing that keeps me going is to talk about what is happening and to remember that the people of Gaza have no voice of their own.\"\nSayegh is not the only person eager for news of loved ones trapped in Gaza.\nA Jerusalem-based nun, who declined to be identified, said she is only able to reach two other nuns sheltering at the Holy Family Church every three or four days.\n“They say they are well and ask us to pray for them,” she said.\nOn Monday, they told her that water supplies were cut and that none of the displaced had been able to shower for at least two weeks.\n“God be with them. Their situation is miserable.”\nFather Ibrahim Nino of the Latin Patriarchate in Jerusalem said the displaced at the church have enough food, water and electricity to last them days and must be frugal.\nBut regardless of the difficult situation, he said, they will celebrate Christmas mass.\nThis year, church leaders in Jerusalem and the city council of Bethlehem — home to the Church of the Nativity where Christians believe Christ was born — decided to dampen Christmas celebrations in solidarity with Gazans.\nAnd in a Christmas message, the patriarchs and heads of churches in Jerusalem lamented that “hope seems distant and beyond” reach for Gazans caught up in 11-weeks of deadly violence.\n“Christmas should be a time of hope and celebration,” said Sayegh. But “it’s really hard to celebrate or feel any joy when Muslims and Christians are being massacred in Gaza and innocent civilians are dying”.\n“I still rejoice in the fact that we know God is with us... He feels the pain of people, of all people.”",

The military says 34 of them are dead.\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive against Hamas has killed at least 34,596 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\njf/bc/imm",
