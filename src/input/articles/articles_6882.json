    "title": "Ashley Benson and Brandon Davis Are 'Ecstatic' Over Baby Girl | Us Weekly",
    "text": "[Ashley Benson](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/ashley-benson/) and [Brandon Davis](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/brandon-davis/) have quickly taken to their roles as parents to their newborn daughter. “Ashley and Brandon couldn’t be more ecstatic to have welcomed their baby girl,” a source exclusively tells Us Weekly. “Although this is their first, Ashley has taken to motherhood like a total pro, and Brandon is already making an incredible father.” Since welcoming their bundle of joy, Davis, 45, has been “waiting on Ashley and the baby hand and foot,” the insider adds. “Ashley thinks it’s so sweet to see him holding and taking care of their daughter.” Benson, 34, and Davis aren’t the only people who have been reveling in the newborn’s arrival. “[Brandon’s mom] Nancy [Davis] and [Ashley’s mom] Shannon [Harte] have both been spending plenty of time with the baby and they’re thrilled to have this precious little girl to dote on,” the source tells Us. “It’s a very special time for the whole family.” News broke that the couple, who wed in late 2023, had [welcomed their first child](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/ashley-benson-gives-birth-welcomes-1st-baby-with-brandon-davis/) on Thursday, February 29, after the [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13139849/Pregnant-Ashley-Benson-baby-bump-Brandon-Davis-breakfast-LA.html) published photos of Benson walking with her husband sans baby bump in Westwood, California. Benson wore a black cropped tank top, comfy black pants and a green striped button-up. Brandon, for his part, paired a black and orange sweater with black shorts and sneakers. Benson confirmed the news via her Instagram Story not long after by sharing a photo of herself holding her baby’s hand. She captioned the adorable snap with a pink heart emoji. The pair have yet to publicly confirm the name of their child. After sparking romance rumors in January 2023, Benson and Brandon made their relationship public that June after the [Pretty Little Liars](https://www.usmagazine.com/shows/pretty-little-liars/) alum shared [Us](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/ashley-benson-pregnant-expecting-1st-baby-with-brandon-davis/) confirmed in October 2023 that Benson was expecting her first child. “[She’s] so excited to be a mom, she’s been eating really well and taking care of her body,” a separate source shared. “Ashley’s family is also thrilled for her.” At the time, another source told Us that the pregnancy announcement “was not a surprise,” as Benson had “wanted to start a family with Brandon.” The insider explained, “It was something that was extremely important to him and was vocalized from the very beginning. She initially wasn’t expecting to have kids at this time in her life but that changed after falling so deeply in love with him.” Last month, an eyewitness shared exclusive details about Benson’s “beautiful” and “stunning” baby shower held at Kathy Hilton’s home. “Brandon was so loving towards Ashley. They mingled with a lot of their guests but hardly left each other’s sides the whole time,” the source told [Us](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/ashley-benson-has-stunning-baby-shower-with-husband-brandon-davis/). “[Their respective moms] Nancy and Shannon were chatting the whole time; [you] could hear them saying how excited they were for their granddaughter to arrive.” According to the insider, guests were treated to “little teddy bear cookies with ‘A❤️B’ written on them.” Attendees had “such a good time” listening to music and enjoying floral arrangements such as “gorgeous heart-shaped rose centerpieces.

    "text": "Dr. Manmohan Singh, former Prime Minister of India and the mind behind the country’s economic liberalisation, passed away at the age of 91. The man, who famously declared, “No power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come,” leaves behind a legacy of transformation that pulled India from the brink of economic collapse and placed it as a rising global power.\nIn July 1991, Indian economy was on the brink of collapse and was suffering from gravest financial crisis. During his maiden budget speech, Singh quoted Victor Hugo, announcing India’s path to economic liberalization. – “India is now wide awake. We shall prevail. We shall overcome.”\nA scholar who turned politician, Singh’s integrity and intellect earned him leadership of India’s Congress-led UPA government for two consecutive terms from 2004 to 2014. Despite of Singh introducing some landmark social welfare programs like MNREGA, the Right to Education Act, Aadhaar, and Direct Benefit Transfers, yet his tenure was not without controversy. He was labelled a “weak Prime Minister” by the critics amidst the corruption scandals, however, Singh stood firm, remarking in 2014 – “I honestly believe that history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media.”\nIn 1999, while reflecting to Indian politics, he had famously quoted Abraham Lincoln – “You can fool some people for all time, all people for some time, but not all people for all time.”",

    "text": "News Search | All News Topics > Healthcare Industry ; Press Releases by Industry Channel > [All Healthcare Industry Press Releases](/pr_archive) Cyberattack OAKLAND — California Attorney General Rob Bonta today joined a bipartisan, multistate coalition of 22 attorneys general in sending a letter to UnitedHealth Group, Inc. — the nation’s largest health insurer as well as physician group, and the parent company of Change Healthcare — urging them to take action to better protect providers, pharmacies, and patients impacted by the catastrophic outage of Change Healthcare. On February 21, 2024, Change Healthcare experienced a cyberattack by ALPHV/Blackcat, which crippled its platform. In the intervening weeks, providers, pharmacies, and facilities have reported catastrophic disruptions to care infrastructure, inability to verify coverage or obtain prior authorization, and inability to process claims or obtain reimbursements. Patients report delayed or denied access to prescription drugs, and scheduling appointments or procedures. The Change Healthcare outage profoundly disrupted patient care and has put some providers on the precipice of financial ruin. “From disrupting operations of hospitals and medical facilities to significant delays in patient care, cyberattacks on our healthcare infrastructure leads to significant harm to our patients,” said Attorney General Bonta. “Change Healthcare’s recent cyberattack laid out these vulnerabilities, and the full impact of the incident remains to be seen today. That’s why today, alongside attorneys general across this country, I am urging UnitedHealth Group to take comprehensive and immediate action to support patients and others who have been affected.” In the letter, the general call upon UnitedHealth Group to act swiftly to limit the harm to the states’ care providers and patients. Specifically, for example, they ask UnitedHealth Group to take the following steps: - Enhance and expand financial assistance, free of onerous terms, to all affected providers, facilities, and pharmacies. - Ensure your financial assistance programs are not providing more advantageous financial assistance to providers, practices, or facilities that are owned by UnitedHealth Group. - Shield the business information of providers and pharmacies from United’s other corporate lines of business. - Suspend requirements for prior authorizations, contemporaneous notifications of change of status, and other documentation requirements. - Provide a dedicated help line for providers, facilities, and pharmacies. - Provide a dedicated complaint resolution mechanism for state attorneys general and relevant state agencies. - Proactively inform providers, facilities, pharmacies, and industry groups associated with each, of the steps they can take to preserve claims and receive prompt reimbursement. - Expeditiously resolve the claims backlog and ensure prompt reimbursement of claims. - Ensure providers, facilities, pharmacies, regulators, affected patients, and the public are informed of what data was compromised and what steps, if any, are needed for providers and patients to mitigate future identity theft or systems risks. Attorney General Bonta is joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, and Washington in sending this letter.

    "text": "População de Fortaleza recebe atendimento médico no maior navio de guerra da América LatinaPacientes pré-agendados tiveram a oportunidade de embarcar e ser atendidos por médicos da Força Armada; Ação contou ainda com exposição de blindados e oficinas de primeiros socorros e saúde bucal Parte da população que utiliza o serviço público de saúde na Capital teve a oportunidade de passar por um atendimento diferenciado neste sábado, 20. Ação conjunta entre a Prefeitura de Fortaleza e a Marinha do Brasil promoveu dia de atendimentos de saúde (consultas e exames), a pacientes previamente agendados, no Navio Aeródromo-Multipropósito Atlântico, ancorado no Porto do Mucuripe. Trata-se do navio capitânia da Marinha brasileira. É a maior embarcação militar da América Latina. Os serviços variaram entre consultas em clínica médica, odontologia, pediatria, além de consultas especializadas. Os pacientes foram encaminhados pelas Unidades de Atenção Primária à Saúde (Uaps) e atendidos por médicos da própria Marinha no interior do navio. Eventuais medicamentos receitados e exames posteriores poderão ser recebidos e feitos nos postos de saúde e outros equipamentos da Capital.

[Assine](https://mais.opovo.com.br/) O POVO acompanhou os atendimentos realizados pela manhã e conversou com civis e militares que participaram. Roberto Rodolfo, 58 anos, aposentado e morador do Serviluz, no Cais do Porto, foi ao local para uma consulta odontológica. “Foi muito agradável. Fui bem atendido na entrada, e por uma excelente profissional médica. Vim para o dentista, mas depois fiz um pedido, aqui mesmo, para ser atendido por um clínico geral. Fui atendido e estão aqui os exames encaminhados para fazer”, disse. Seu Rodolfo, que se identificou ainda como “Testinha”, como é conhecido no Serviluz, disse que foi encaminhado para o atendimento no navio pelo posto de saúde do bairro. “A agente de saúde da minha rua me indicou para vir até aqui e para mim foi muito satisfatório”.

Todo esse atendimento tem suporte e apoio da secretaria, no sentido de facilitar que esses pacientes façam o atendimento (no navio) e não pare por aí. No caso do medicamento, podem receber nas nossas unidades”, disse. Nikolas Gomes, 18 anos, que recém cincluiu o Ensino Médio, disse que ficou sabendo da ação a partir de uma amiga da mãe. “Ela avisou minha mãe, que conseguiu agendar nossa consulta. O jovem relatou ter ficado um pouco “zonzo” com o balançar do navio, mas reforçou que a sensação amenizou com o tempo que passou dentro do local. “O navio é muito grande. É uma experiência muito boa e o atendimento foi bastante agradável”. Já Thomas Pereira, mecânico de refrigeração, foi com a mulher e a filha participar da ação. “Soube a partir de uma ligação da Prefeitura, que nos informou que ia ter esse atendimento e nossa pequenininha (filha) foi contemplada com a consulta. Viemos e ela gostou bastante”, contou, enquanto a filha tirava fotos com militares da Marinha. A experiência agradou e os participantes responderam se voltariam para uma nova oportunidade de consulta. “Com certeza, sim”, relatou um dos entrevistados. “Se tivesse pelo menos uma vez a cada seis meses, ou anualmente, seria ótimo”, pontuou um segundo entrevistado. O comandante do Navio-Aeródromo Multipropósito Atlântico, Capitão de Mar e Guerra Eugênio Campos Huguenin, explicou que a ação promovida em parceria com a Secretaria da Saúde de Fortaleza é parte de uma Ação Cívico-Social (Aciso) que contou ainda com doação de alimentos e doação de sangue, com militares voluntários no dia anterior. “É uma ação que é boa para os dois lados. Boa para a secretaria, que contribui para a redução de filas, e também para a gente, que aproximamos o militar da sociedade e mostramos um pouco do que a Marinha faz e contribui para a defesa do País”, destacou Huguenin. O ambiente de espera, logo na entrada do navio, contava ainda com exposição de veículos blindados, oficinas de primeiros socorros e saúde bucal, além de uma área de coffee break para o público. O comandante explicou que a preparação da área de espera também foi pensada com antecedência. “Quando o pessoal vem aqui, como tem uma certa espera. A gente pensou em colocar material para exposição, naquela intenção de mostrar para o público um pouco da nossa vida. E também a parte de saúde, com instruções de primeiros socorros e reanimação e também a parte de saúde dentária. As crianças gostam muito dessa parte, se aproximam, vêm, é uma forma da criança desde cedo estar atenta à saúde”, concluiu o militar. [Fale com a gente](https://www.opovo.com.br/falecomagente)",

    "text": "Pakistan’s second-largest city of Lahore was deluged with record-breaking rainfall yesterday, the national weather agency said, with hospitals flooded, power interrupted and streets in the metropolis submerged.\nThe eastern city was lashed by almost 360mm (14”) of rain in three hours, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said.\n“This was record-breaking rainfall,” the agency’s deputy director Farooq Dar told AFP.\nThe previous record dates to July 1980, when 332mm fell over three hours.\n“Look at all these buckets and how much water has accumulated. We’re exhausted from trying to remove the water,” Sadam, a 32-year-old shopkeeper, told AFP as he took stock of his considerable losses.\nThe PMD had forecast a wetter-than-usual monsoon season this year for Pakistan, one of the countries experts say is most vulnerable to extreme weather being spurred by climate change.\nOver the past three days, 24 people have been killed by rainfall in the country’s mountainous northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority said.\nIn Lahore, a city of 13mn in the eastern Punjab province, one person was killed by electrocution as a result of yesterday’s cloudburst, according to local police.\nThe city’s commissioner declared an emergency and said offices and schools would be shut for the day.\nYasir Ali, a 26-year-old resident, said it was a “sad day for the nation”.\n“For a poor person it is heartbreaking that he’s been unable to go to work today,” he told AFP.\nTwo government hospitals in Lahore reported flooding in their wards, and there were intermittent power outages continuing into the afternoon.\nRoads were also submerged, bringing traffic and businesses to a standstill.\nAhmed Khan, 48, who earns a daily wage, appealed to the government “to pay some attention here and resolve this water issue”.\nMaryam Sharif, the chief minister of Punjab province, posted on X that “the entire government machinery is in the field” to drain the water.\nThe summer monsoon brings to South Asia about 70-80% of the region’s annual rainfall between June and September.\nIt is vital for agriculture, but changing weather patterns that scientists attribute to climate change are putting both lives and livelihoods at risk.\nEarlier this year Pakistan – home to 240mn people – was hit by a succession of heatwaves and this April was the wettest since 1961.\nAt least 143 people died from lightning strikes and other storm-related incidents in April.\nIn neighbouring India, at least 160 people, most believed to be labourers and their families, have been killed by torrential rains causing landslides in the southern coastal state of Kerala.\nIn 2022, a third of Pakistan was submerged by unprecedented monsoon rains that displaced millions of people and cost $30bn, according to a World Bank estimate.\nGirls wade through a flooded street in Lahore. – AFP",
