    "title": "Volkswagen's rejection of Union proposals sparks workers' anger and strike threat",
    "text": "Volkswagen on Friday rejected as unrealistic a union proposal to make cost cuts at the carmaker's German operations without having to close factories, sparking anger from worker representatives as strikes loom.The crisis-wracked auto titan has been locked in bitter talks with unions since announcing in September that it was mulling the unprecedented step of shuttering plants in Germany.The powerful IG Metall union has indicated industrial action could start from December 1 if Volkswagen does not withdraw the drastic plans.(Also read: Volkswagen India receives $1.4 billion tax evasion notice from govt: Report)VW has been hit hard by high manufacturing costs at home, a stuttering shift to electric vehicles and tough competition in key market China.Ahead of the latest round of talks last week, the union and VW's works councils put forward a series of proposals they said would save 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion) in labour costs without the need for site closures.These included proposals for management and staff to waive bonuses. The union also said it could drop a demand for pay rises in exchange for working shorter hours at some factories.But Volkswagen said it had concluded that, while the measures could help in the short term, they would not lead \"to any long-term financial relief for the company in the coming years\".\"A sustainable saving of 1.5 billion euros cannot be determined even after intensive analysis,\" said the group, whose brands range from Audi to Skoda and Seat, in a statement.(Also read: Eying a Volkswagen Taigun? Also check out these five alternative SUVs)IG Metall described VW's response as \"extremely regrettable\", accusing it of \"ignoring the constructive proposals of the employee representatives\".VW was continuing to insist on \"extreme positions\", a union spokesman said, adding that the automaker \"has yet to answer the question of what steps it is willing to take to meet the employees halfway\".Worker representatives say at least three VW plants are at risk of closure in Germany and tens of thousands of jobs could go, with remaining employees facing hefty pay cuts.The two sides are set for fresh talks on December 9.",

    "text": "SANTA CLARA — Ricky Pearsall laced up his black and white Nike cleats. He wore a gray 49ers T-shirt that matched his sweatpants. He flipped his gray cap backward. A football spun in his hands. He high-fived one teammate, then another.\nRelated Articles San Francisco 49ers | Former SJSU lineman Wes Schweitzer is Jets’ foremost rock climber — at 325 pounds San Francisco 49ers | 49ers mailbag: Season-opening concerns linger over Pearsall, Williams San Francisco 49ers | Why some of 49ers’ most faithful fans are fuming over team’s new parking rules San Francisco 49ers | How to watch the 49ers vs. Jets on Monday Night Football even if there’s a blackout on DirecTV San Francisco 49ers | Luke McCaffrey looks to make his own name in the NFL apart from dad and brothers Each movement, every sight, every breath is surely not taken for granted.\n“It’s kind of been amazing just watching him,” said coach Kyle Shanahan, who spoke Thursday for the first time since Pearsall was shot in the chest Saturday by an attempted robber in San Francisco’s Union Square.\nPearsall watched Thursday’s practice like any kid wishing he could just play ball. Instead, he could only toss the ball in the air to himself, while showing no impairment from a bullet that, according to Shanahan, struck the rookie wide receiver just two inches below a chest tattoo of praying hands.\nPearsall has been a constant presence at 49ers headquarters since his one-night hospitalization. Rather than be a distraction ahead of Monday night’s season opener against the New York Jets, this year’s first-round draft pick is providing inspiration.\n“Thank God he’s even alive with us today. It was an insane situaion, and I’m so happy he’s here around the building with us,” linebacker Fred Warner said.\nPearsall is not allowed to play in at least the first four games while on the Reserve/Non-Football Injury List. However, in the immediate aftermath of being shot, Pearsall had other ideas.\n“I still think I can play against the Jets,” Pearsall told Shanahan in a FaceTime call him from his hospital bed Saturday afternoon.\n“I’m like, ‘Dude what are you talking about. There are other things (in life),’” Shanahan said. “When that adrenaline goes away, that (mental aspect) is a much bigger deal.”\nPearsall is walking around, attending meetings, and must wait a week before working up a sweat. Then he’ll ramp up his rehab to make his NFL debut as soon as next month.\nShanahan said he and the 49ers organization took about an hour to locate which hospital Pearsall was rushed to after the afternoon shooting. “By the time we got to him, it was good. He FaceTimed me and it was the first time I knew he was alright,” said Shanahan, who then relayed that positive prognosis to the rest of the 49ers as they arrived for a scheduled team party at the coach’s house.\nShanahan said he’s advised his team not to badger Pearsall in asking for details about the shooting, adding: “I told the team I don’t want to make him relive that 80 times. He knows how much everyone cares. He loves being around. It’s all up to him. Everyone is trying to give him space and let him work through that process. It’s a pretty big mental toll, too.”\nTEAM CAPTAINS\nDefensive end Nick Bosa half-jokingly called it “big-time news” that he and other 49ers captains will get reserved parking spots closer to the locker room.\nBosa and linebacker Fred Warner are the only defensive players who are captains, while the ball, er, the captain’s patch also got spread around to Brock Purdy, Kyle Juszczyk, Deebo Samuel and Trent Williams.\n“Being a captain on a team like this with unbelievable players who’ve done great things in this league, it’s an honor and I want to uphold it,” said Bosa, who was a captain in 2022 but not last season after his holdout lasted into Week 1 of the season.\nMcCAFFREY STILL LIMITED\nRunning back Christian McCaffrey looked fine in practice but remains limited by not just a calf but an Achilles issue, which is not a new injury, Shanahan said; Thursday marked the first day since last season in which the 49ers must provide an official injury and participation report. McCaffrey participated in Tuesday’s light, one-hour practice for his first team work since Aug. 4.\nNot practicing Thursday were defensive end Yetur Gross-Matos (knee) and linebacker Dee Winters (ankle), both of whom ran on the side. Others limited: wide receiver Jauan Jennings (ankle), running back Isaac Guerendo (groin), safety Talanoa Hufanga (knee) and guard Aaron Banks (pinky).\nQUARTERBACK ROTATION\nBrandon Allen beat out Josh Dobbs to serve as Brock Purdy’s immediate backup, at least for Monday’s opener, Shanahan announced. Allen did not play last season as the No. 3 quarterback behind Purdy and Sam Darnold, the latter of whom is now the Minnesota Vikings’ starter.\nRODGERS ON 49ERS\nAs Aaron Rodgers prepares to start against the 49ers for the 15th time in his 20-year career, the Chico native and Cal product claims he no longer harbors a grudge over not being drafted No. 1 in 2005 by his childhood team.\n“It’s all different people. I’ve outlasted a lot of people over there. A lot are still coaching around the league. It’s a great staff over there,” Rodgers told Jets’ reporters. “I’ve played against John Lynch, that’s how old I am. And obviously I’ve had battles against Kyle. And (defensive coordinator Nick) Sorensen, I think I’ve played against him too. There’s a lot of familiarity there.”\nActually, Rodgers was still backing up Brett Favre when the Packers went into Denver and beat Lynch’s Broncos in 2007. Sorensen indeed played against Rodgers in 2009, and it was Sorensen who made the tackle on the second-half kickoff for the Browns.\n“Obviously it’s fun to go back to the Bay Area. But it really is just another game,” Rodgers added. “If this had happened first or second year as a starter, it’s a different energy when all the guys you feel passed on you, you have some bitterness you hold onto. I don’t have any of that anymore.”\nRodgers also harbors no ill will toward new 49ers pass rusher Leonard Floyd, who was the one who sacked Rodgers on the play he sustained a torn Achilles in the Jets’ opener last year against the Buffalo Bills.",

    "title": "Beyond Meat founder and CEO: The arc of history is on our side",
    "text": "Beyond Meat founder and CEO: The arc of history is on our side\nCooking up change in a well-entrenched, well-capitalized industry isn't easy.\nSuch is the story of the ticker symbol BYND, formally known down supermarket aisles across America as Beyond Meat (\nBYND).\nWhile the price of Beyond Meat stock has changed over the years, its CEO and founder Ethan Brown hasn’t. The basketball-loving former fuel cell industry exec remains laser-focused on taking the company he founded in 2009 with his own savings to the next level.\n\"We believe the arc of history is on our side and that we're going to make this thing into the long-term success that we've been after,\" Brown said on the latest episode of Yahoo Finance's\nLead This Way (video above).\nBeyond Meat burst onto investors' radar on May 5, 2019, with a\nsizzling initial public offering on the Nasdaq.\nInvestors devoured shares of a company they saw as the leader in the budding plant-based food movement. The company priced its IPO at $25 a share, opened for trading at $46, and then surged to $65.75 by the close. The gain when that closing bell sounded: a tasty 163%.\nFrom there, it was a whirlwind of activity for Beyond Meat and Brown, with\nbig deals with global restaurant chains such as Yum! Brands-owned KFC and Dunkin’ Donuts ( YUM), expansion plans into the refrigerated food sections at Target ( TGT) and retailers overseas, and efforts underway to expand manufacturing capacity and create new plant-based items.\nBy July 2019, shares of Beyond Meat hit a peak of $234.90 a share.\nHowever, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic hammered the restaurant industry, and its financial toll sent people back to cheaper meat-based items at supermarkets. Beyond Meat’s impressive momentum stalled along with the rest of the plant-based food movement, including at rival Impossible Foods.\nAlong the way, attacks from entrenched parties in the meat industry and media on the healthiness of plant-based items hurt Beyond Meat’s standing with consumers. By November 2022, with losses eating into cash flow, the company was forced to lay off 19% of its workforce.\nThen in November of this year, Beyond Meat — which has cut prices to stimulate demand — said it would slash 19% of its non-production workforce after a softer-than-expected third quarter.\nThird quarter sales fell 8.7% from the prior year to $75.3 million. The company lost $57.5 million on an adjusted operating profit basis.\n\"You know that there's going to be resistance to change, and maybe early on we felt that when we first launched, and particularly after the IPO, that it was going to happen overnight,\" Brown told Yahoo Finance several months before the latest round of layoffs. \"That obviously has not proven to be the case.\"\n\"But the very reason that we started this company and the very reason that consumers are reaching for a product strengthens every single day, whether it's the health angle, whether it's climate, whether it's the energy and water use or animal welfare,\" Brown continued. \"All of those issues are intensifying, and we have a solution that is available to anyone who wants it.\"\nToday, Beyond Meat stock trades at $8.95 a share — well off its dizzying post-IPO heights. The company's market cap is $577.6 million compared to $18.46 billion for\nmeat king Tyson ( TSN), per Yahoo Finance comparison data.\n\"In terms of what’s driving the US softness, it’s more of the same: Consumers just continue to shy away from the category for a variety of reasons, including taste and perceived health benefits (or the lack thereof),\" JPMorgan packaged food analyst Ken Goldman said.\nGoldman rates Beyond Meat shares Underweight, the equivalent of a Sell rating.\nMeanwhile, Brown remains focused on defying the critics. Beyond Meat has recently opened a sprawling 288,000-square-foot headquarters in a former aircraft hangar in El Segundo, Calif., steps away from the HQ of Barbie\nmaker Mattel ( MAT). The location is outfitted with a state-of-the-art test kitchen and a generally open floor plan that may foster the next big thing in plant-based food.\nThe new facility even has a McDonald’s (\nMCD) themed test kitchen where the company focuses on cooking up potential new items for the Golden Arches.\nThe 6-foot-5 Brown has a corner office with his KPIs (key performance indicators) on the outside wall to encourage employee discussion. Brown often makes the rounds in the building to chat up employees with his trademark cool, welcoming vibe.\nBrown acknowledged that the road ahead won’t be easy and he isn't yet in the mindset to reflect on the path of the business to this point. But he will not be deterred in his personal mission to do good for the planet by leading with heart and hustle.\n\"I have to see [my mission] through to completion,\" Brown said. \"I think it'll be something [that] when it's said and done, I might look back. But right now I'm in the fight, so it's hard to see.\"\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Before then, these fax numbers will not be operational. We encourage taxpayers to wait until this procedure is available rather than mail their Forms 1139 and 1045 since mail processing is being impacted by the emergency.\nFile size limitations: A maximum of 100 pages can be initially faxed to either of the fax numbers listed above. If additional documentation is required to be attached or deemed to be necessary, taxpayers will be notified during the processing of the Form 1139 or Form 1045.\nHow does the process change from the normal hard copy mailing requirement?\nPreviously, these forms could be filed only via hard copy delivered through the USPS or by a private delivery service. There are well-established procedures for processing the hard copy forms in order to provide quick tentative refunds to taxpayers. A temporary procedure to accept these forms via fax permits us to make the relief in the CARES Act available to taxpayers before IRS processing centers are able to reopen. The procedures to process claims will remain the same - the only difference is to allow an additional method to file eligible refund claims.\nIf I previously mailed in my Form 1139 or Form 1045, can I now fax it to these numbers?\nYes, if you previously mailed a hard copy of either of these forms that is an eligible refund claim (because it contains changes permitted by the AMT and NOL provisions of the CARES Act identified above) after March 27, 2020, you can now submit that same claim to the fax numbers stated above starting on April 17.\nIs there an order of priority in processing Form 1139 and Form 1045 under this temporary fax procedure?\nAll claims (including those received before our processing centers were closed) will be processed in the order of receipt.\nWhat happens if a document faxed as instructed above is deemed an ineligible refund claim under this temporary fax procedure?\nIt will be processed after normal operations resume.\nSection 2303 of the CARES Act amended section 172(b)(1) to provide for a carryback of any net operating loss (NOL) arising in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2021, to each of the five taxable years preceding the taxable year in which the loss arises (carryback period). I am carrying back an NOL to a tax year in which I have a section 965(a) inclusion (section 965 year) and am now entitled to a refund for the section 965 year because my section 965 net tax liability is fully paid. May I use Form 1139 or Form 1045, as applicable, to apply for a refund for the section 965 year?\nYes, you may disregard the instructions for Form 1139 and Form 1045 which prohibit taxpayers from using these forms to apply for refunds for 965 years. The instructions to these forms will be updated to reflect this change.\nHowever, please be aware that because the CARES Act added section 172(b)(1)(D)(iv) to provide that a taxpayer who has a carryback to a section 965 year is deemed to have made a section 965(n) election that limits the amount of the loss that can be carried back to each such year, an NOL can be carried back only to reduce income in excess of the amount of the net section 965(a) inclusion. The IRS expects to issue additional instructions on filing requests for tentative refunds for taxpayers with outstanding section 965(h) net tax liabilities, so that these requests and liabilities can be identified, routed, and tracked appropriately, and so that payment schedules can be adjusted to avoid unintentional or erroneous acceleration of deferred section 965(h) installment payments, delays in refunds, or other processing complications.\nWill the IRS be establishing a similar procedure for Form 4466 “Corporation Application for Quick Refund of Overpayment of Estimated Tax”?\nNo, the Form 4466 must be filed in accordance with existing form instructions. If a Form 4466 is faxed to the fax number noted above, it will not be accepted for processing.\nWill this temporary faxing process become permanent?\nNo, accepting faxed versions of these forms that are normally delivered through the USPS or by a private delivery service is meant as a short-term measure to assist taxpayers in receiving refunds provided under the CARES Act as quickly as possible.\nWill the IRS be establishing a similar procedure for Form 1120X, Amended U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return?\nNo, the Form 1120X must be filed in accordance with existing form instructions. If a Form 1120X is faxed to the fax number noted above, it will not be accepted for processing.\nWhat will happen if I filed a Form 1120X that has not been processed and I used those numbers in my Form 1139 filing?\nYour Form 1139 must reflect your originally filed or previously processed amended return information. If your Form 1139 does not match your IRS account, the Form 1139 cannot be processed because the Form 1120X needs to be processed first. For example, if you gave a Form 1120X to your examination team, it has not been processed.\nDo not attempt to file an amended return at time of filing Form 1139. Amended returns will not be acted upon when filed with Form 1139 through the temporary fax procedures.\nThe current version of Form 1139 (2018) does not provide for tentative refunds for refundable prior year minimum tax credits. How should I complete the Form 1139 if I am only claiming tentative refunds of prior year minimum tax credits? How should I complete the 2018 Form 8827?\nThe following instructions apply for the 2018 Forms 1139 and 8827 to allow for the changes per CARES Act Section 2305(b).\nForm 1139\nInclude at the top of Form 1139, “Electing to Take 100% Refundable Credit Amount in 2018 - per CARES Act Section 2305(b)”.\nYou should complete Lines 1(d) and 29 of the Form 1139. Leave Lines 1a through 1c and 2 through 28 blank.\nForm 8827\nWhen completing Line 6 of the Worksheet for Calculating the Refundable Minimum Tax Credit Amount on 2018 Form 8827 replace “50%” in the instructions on Line 6 with “100%.”\nShould I file the application for a tentative refund and claim both the NOL carryback and 100% refundable minimum tax credit on the same 2018 Form 1139 and how?\nYes, you should use the same Form 1139 for both claims.\nComplete Lines 1a through 1c and 2 through 28 as appropriate, following the existing Form 1139 instructions to report your NOL carryback.\nEnter on Line 1(d), the minimum tax credit carryforward to 2019, as reported on the original Form 8827 Line 9. Disregard the instructions for Form 1139, Line 1(d) “Other”. Disregard the instructions for Form 1139, Line 29 “Overpayment of tax due to a claim of right adjustment under section 1341(b)(1).”\nComplete the 2018 Form 8827 as follows:\nInclude at the top of 2018 Form 8827, “Electing to Take 100% Refundable Credit Amount in 2018 - per CARES Act Section 2305(b).”\nWhen completing Line 6 of the Worksheet for Calculating the Refundable Minimum Tax Credit Amount of the 2018 Form 8827 replace “50%” in the instructions on Line 6 with “100%.”\nComplete the remainder of 2018 Form 8827 according to the instructions.\nIf you have a carryback of a net operating loss for the taxable year and are applying for a tentative carryback refund and a 100% refundable minimum tax credit tentative refund, ordering rules apply. You must take into account any adjustments made in applying for the tentative carryback adjustment before determining the amount of the overpayment attributable to the 100% refundable minimum tax credit refund. (Treas. Reg. §5.6411-1).\nCaution: adjustments to alternative minimum tax in the carryback years could affect the amount of the 100% refundable minimum tax credit allowed in 2018.\nWhat documents should I attach to 2018 Form 1139 for a tentative refund for a 100% refundable minimum tax credit or the NOL carryback?\nA. If you are only claiming a tentative refund for a net operating loss carryback, follow the existing instructions for Form 1139.\nB. If you are only claiming a refund for the minimum tax credit, you should attach (1) the first three pages of the originally filed or previously processed amended 2018 Form 1120, including Schedule J, (2) a copy of the originally filed 2018 Form 8827, (3) the first three pages of the revised 2018 Form 1120, reflecting the change with the 100% refundable minimum tax credit, and (4) the revised 2018 Form 8827.\nC. If you are claiming\nfax send and receive online both a refund for the minimum tax credit and the NOL carryback, follow the existing instructions for Form 1139 for the NOL carryback and the instructions in (B) above for the 100% refundable minimum tax credit refund. Do not attempt to file an amended return at time of filing Form 1139. Amended returns will not be acted upon when filed with Form 1139 through the temporary fax procedures.\nWhat will happen if the IRS needs additional information or has questions with my Form 1139?\nIf there is missing information or questions about your filing, you will be contacted by phone. It is important to ensure your name and phone number are accurately reflected on the Form 1139. The person listed will need to be able to provide the missing information and possibly authentication information.\nI am currently under examination. Can I give the Form 1139 to the examiner?\nNo, you should not give the Form 1139 to the examiner. You should file it via the normal process or via the temporary procedures outlined within.",

    "text": "Missing hiker found alive after being lost for 10 days in mountains SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, Calif. (KSBW) - A missing hiker was finally rescued after he was lost for 10 days in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California. The 34-year-old man was only going for a three-hour hike when he disappeared. “I didn’t bring anything because I thought I was doing a three-hour hike to go to work,” Lukas McClish, the rescued hiker, said. He was lost in the woods for nine nights and 10 days, shirtless with only a flashlight and folding scissors. It would be more than a week before the raggedy-looking hiker would be found. “So, I kind of just hiked. Each day, I go up a canyon, down a canyon to the next waterfall, sit down by the waterfall, drink water out of my boot,” Lukas McClish recalled. It was a Tuesday when Lukas McClish went for a hike in Boulder Creek and ended up getting lost. “I felt comfortable the whole time I was out there. I wasn’t worried about it,” Lukas McClish said. “I had a mountain lion that was following me, but it was cool. It kept its distances. I think it was just somebody watching over me.” The problem was that Lukas McClish didn’t tell anyone where he was going. By the time Father’s Day rolled around on Sunday, his family started worrying and filed a missing person’s report. The search was on then. “Some nights, although, I just had to trust God that he was going to be OK, and that was hard to do some nights when we would go to bed at night because I would worry about where he was, where he was sleeping and how cold he was and where he was if he was alive,” Diane McClish, the hiker’s mother, said. Lukas McClish drank from water from creeks, ate wild berries and slept on a wet bed of leaves all while yelling for help and thinking of his next meal. “‘Just help. Help, I’m over here.’ Or, ‘Is anybody out there?’” Lukas McClish remembered saying while he was lost. “I want a burrito or a taco bowl. That’s what I thought about every day when I, after the first five days, when I started to kind of realize that I might be in over my head.” But on Thursday afternoon, someone finally heard his cries for help. The Boulder Creek Fire Department deployed a drone and spotted his location. A K-9 tracked him down and Lukas McClish was escorted out of a remote canyon, finally reunited with family. “Met a lot of people because I had more people come to me and tell me how much they love my son and how they just hoped that we would find him,” Diane McClish said. “I didn’t realize that so many people in this town love Luke.” Fortunately, Lukas McClish had no major injuries.
