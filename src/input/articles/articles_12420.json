    "text": "Asian Regulators Are Not Just Airing Their Safety Concerns—They’re Sharing Them! Ladies and gentlemen, hold onto your hats—or better yet, your life vests—because the aviation world is getting a bit of an upgrade in the safety department! Yes, you heard it right. Regulators from five Southeast Asian countries— Indonesia , Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand—are embarking on a brand-new adventure: the Regional Aviation Safety Data and Information Sharing Initiative. Now, that’s a mouthful! I mean, why not just call it “Operation: Stay in the Air.”\nA Leap Towards the Skies of Safety 🍃✈️ What’s sparked this sudden spree of cooperation, you ask? Well, it seems like the collective realization that “safety first” might actually be worth taking seriously. You know what they say, “Better safe than sorry,” especially when you’re several miles above the ground, hurtling through the air at 500 miles per hour, right? So, these countries have decided that instead of each one flying solo (pun intended), they’d pool their resources and data to better identify safety hazards and trends. After all, if one country has a near miss, why not let the others know? Sharing is caring, especially when it involves aversion of imminent doom!\nThe Signing Ceremony: Give Us a Wave! 👋 On October 17, 2024, representatives from each country signed this historic agreement. Picture it: a group of aviation regulators gathered together like a gaggle of geese, bonding over their mutual goal of creating a safer aviation environment, all while deftly avoiding any discussions about what happened on those poorly reviewed airlines. Honestly, wouldn’t you pay to watch that? (Not that I advocate for disaster tourism, mind you!).\nThe graphic accompanying the article serves as a reminder that sometimes, when it comes to aviation safety, cooperation really does look quite dapper! Flanked by their national flags, they lined up for the cameras, smiling like they just won a ticket to the best theme park in the world. Except, this ride is a lot safer and involves a lot less screaming.\nWhat’s on the Agenda? 📋 So what exactly does “collectively identifying safety hazards” involve? Well, it’s like bringing your report card into a study group, showing everyone your areas of weakness, and hoping they don’t mention your penchant for failing gym class. These countries will analyze shared data to understand trends, mitigating measures, and best practices. Essentially, they’re saying, “Let’s not just share our snacks but also our boo-boos!”\nAnd let’s face it, in today’s globalized world, it makes perfect sense. If one airplane has a bird-strike and it’s not reported, the next plane could very well encounter a flock of angry pigeons—nobody wants that confrontation!\nTime to Buckle Up! 🛡️ Now, one might argue, “Why haven’t they done this sooner?” Well, let’s not start throwing shade; the aviation sector is notoriously slow to adopt changes. It’s like watching your dad try to figure out the latest smartphone—conflicted expressions and occasional mutterings about “back in my day.” But here we are, five countries coming together, eager to share their data, for the sake of flying safely!\nIt’s refreshing to see this commitment to aviation safety, considering the really tricky business of air travel. Where else can you drink a mojito while cruising through clouds at 38,000 feet? So, hats off to our brave aviation regulators—may your data be ever enlightening, and your skies be ever clear!\nLet’s Land This Plane 🚁 In a world that often feels divided, let’s celebrate this cross-border collaboration. It reminds us that for all our differences, when it comes to our safety—especially at 31,000 feet in the air—everyone wants the same outcome: a safe, smooth ride without any surprises.\nRemember, folks, when in doubt, look down the aisle, share your tales of aerial mishaps, and keep the laughter rolling. Because if we can’t find humor in near-fatal errors, what’s the point of all this?\nSo, here’s to the brave souls working behind the scenes—on the ground and in the sky—making aviation safer, one shared piece of data at a time! Cheers! 🍹✈️",

    "text": "财联社7月31日讯（编辑 马兰） 人工智能是本轮美股上涨的重要支撑力，然而市场一直对人工智能公司的盈利能力怀有不确定性，不少悲观人士更是认为市场正陷入巨大的AI泡沫之中。\n据业内人士透露，作为人工智能领军行业的OpenAI在今年实现了收入大幅增长的目标。今年前七个月，OpenAI的收入大约翻了一番，预计年收入将达到120亿美元。这意味着OpenAI每月的营收达到10亿美元左右。\n与此同时，消息人士还指出，OpenAI的旗舰产品ChatGPT每周约有7亿活跃用户，个人和企业用户都在广泛使用这一AI工具。\n市场曾爆料OpenAI在2024年的营收为37亿美元，净亏损50亿美元，但该公司其后并未证实具体的营收和亏损数字。尽管如此，今年120亿美元的年化收入仍代表着该公司在财务业绩上的巨大突破，也可能让投资者更具信心。\n吃钱的巨兽\nOpenAI收入的增长主要依赖于ChatGPT订阅业务，据估计该业务占到OpenAI总收入的70%。但另一方面，居高不下的运营成本依旧是困扰OpenAI发展的一大问题。\n有分析指出，OpenAI每1美元的收入将伴随着2.25美元的成本，粗略估计该公司今年的运营支出预计将超过280亿美元，主要与微软的云计算服务、星际之门数据中心项目及与CoreWeave的129亿美元五年期协议有关。\n除财务数字之外，OpenAI目前还面临着激烈的创新与人才之战。今年已经有多位OpenAI的人工智能研究员跳槽，其可能削弱OpenAI在技术上的领先程度，并增加该公司在人力上的成本。\n这意味着OpenAI仍需要继续筹集庞大的资金来维持其领先地位。据悉，OpenAI正在为今年3月宣布的400亿美元融资计划努力，本周一重新开启了融资进程，向新老投资者寻求资金。\n该轮融资由日本软银集团领投，并在第一阶段筹集了100亿美元，其中75亿美元来自于软银，剩余资金来自于其他投资者。OpenAI现在希望完成剩下的300亿美元融资，其中225亿美元将来自软银。\n但如果OpenAI未能在年底前履行重组实现对软银的承诺，软银的投资可能被削减至100亿美元。",

    "title": "A diabetes drug that helps slow the progression of Parkinson’s disease",
    "text": "France – A study has found that a diabetes drug may be able to slow the progression of Parkinson’s disease, which represents an “important step forward” for treating the disease.\nThe study revealed that the development of motor symptoms, such as tremors and slow movement, slowed down in patients who took the treatment called lixisenatide.\nThe drug belongs to a group of drugs called glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (or GLP-1R agonists) which work by mimicking the action of a natural gut hormone that is produced after eating.\nThis hormone stimulates the release of insulin from the pancreas, which helps the body’s cells absorb glucose, which is ultimately converted into energy.\nThere is a known link between Parkinson’s disease and type 2 diabetes, as research indicates that people with diabetes have a greater risk of developing Parkinson’s disease.\nAccording to previous research, people with Parkinson’s disease and those with type 2 diabetes often experience a faster progression of their symptoms.\nIt has also been reported that people with diabetes who are treated with medications have a lower risk of developing Parkinson’s disease.\nDr Richard Wise, Director of Clinical Development at Parkinson’s Therapy, said: ‘I am delighted to see the very positive and ground-breaking clinical outcome of the lixisenatide trial, which could have real meaning for people living with Parkinson’s disease.’\nThe LixiPark study included about 21 different research centers affiliated with the NS-Park network throughout France, and included about 156 participants who had recently been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. They were treated with either lixisenatide, which is licensed to treat diabetes, or a placebo along with the usual Parkinson’s medication.\nThe progression of motor symptoms slowed in those receiving lixisenatide treatment, while motor symptoms in participants in the placebo group continued to progress.\nResults were consistent at the end of the 12-month study and two months after treatment stopped. Researchers say deeper studies are now needed.\nProfessors Vasilios Meissner and Olivier Rascol, lead researchers on the study, said: “For 30 years, we have been trying to understand how to slow the decline associated with Parkinson’s disease over time. In this context, the positive results of the phase 2 trial of Lixipark, which showed reduced progression in motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease over the course of a year, constitute an important step forward in the future management of the disease. We look forward to confirming these encouraging results in the future, in order to translate these results into clinical practice.”\nMasood Hussain, professor of neuroscience at the University of Oxford, said: “The results of this trial are really encouraging for people with Parkinson’s disease. After a year, the patients who were taking the medication were significantly better off in their movements than those who were not taking the medication. However, the results do not provide conclusive evidence that the drug has a protective effect on the brain to effectively slow the progression of the disease.”\nHe pointed out that it is necessary to take into account side effects, as nausea occurred in 46% of those receiving lixisenatide, and vomiting occurred in 13%.\nSource: Independent\n#diabetes #drug #helps #slow #progression #Parkinsons #disease\n2024-04-04 22:34:52\nRelated posts:\n\"Warrix Sports\" takes over \"Stadium One\" to show football on the big screen. 5 Drinks for Penis Health: The Ultimate Guide for Men palpation found a lump in the neck - under the armpit just enlarged lymph nodes or lymphoma signs Helping Your Child Improve Concentration: Tips and Strategies for Parents Optimal Diet for Gallbladder Health: Reduce Meat Fat and Emphasize Vegetables and Lean Meat Latest Soccer Regulation Updates: Controversial Changes in Goalkeeper Behavior and Offside Rules Continuing Threat: Covid-19 Rages On in Europe with Over 1,000 Weekly Deaths Île-de-France this Friday, June 10, 2022: evolution of the health situation in the region",

CIUDAD DE MÉXICO.- Por medio de un comunicado, la Comisión Nacional de Derechos Humanos (CNDH) emitió este jueves una recomendación al Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado ( [ISSSTE](https://www.elimparcial.com/mexico/ISSSTE-registra-ahorro-de-300-mdp-tras-suspender-pensiones-de-personas-fallecidas-20231223-0029.html)) debido a negligencias en el tratamiento de un anciano que resultaron en secuelas neurológicas. La CNDH señaló que dos médicos del Hospital Regional (HR) de Puebla que atendieron al paciente no consideraron un estudio clínico completo ni una evaluación exhaustiva. Además, no establecieron un plan de tratamiento para las secuelas neurológicas ni brindaron atención médica integral para su enfermedad cerebrovascular. En su recomendación, la CNDH insta al ISSSTE a llevar a cabo una reparación integral del daño, previa gestión para inscribir al paciente en el Registro Nacional de Víctimas. También se exige atención por parte del servicio de Neurología y apoyo psicológico, así como colaboración en la presentación y seguimiento de un proceso administrativo contra los dos funcionarios públicos involucrados. Además, se requiere que el Instituto ofrezca un curso de capacitación sobre el derecho a la protección de la salud y el trato digno hacia los adultos mayores. El ISSSTE debe emitir una circular dirigida al personal de Neurología, indicando que en ausencia del médico asignado, cualquier personal médico disponible debe atender a los pacientes con citas programadas, sin importar si son sus pacientes regulares o no.",

    "text": "One of 2024's strongest meteor showers set to light up the sky this week Published | Last updated Featured Image Credit: Getty Stock Images We might only be three days into 2024, but one of the strongest meteor showers set to happen this entire year is already upon us. With up to 120 shooting stars being visible each hour, the Quadrantid [meteor](https://www.unilad.com/science) shower could prove to be a spectacle as it reaches its peak overnight tonight (January 3). Loading… The meteors appear to shoot from a region in [space](https://www.unilad.com/space) which is bounded by the constellations of Draco, Boötes and Hercules. The area used to be known as the constellation of Quadrans Muralis, hence the name 'Quadrantids', but like Pluto being stripped of its planetary title, the area is no longer recognized as a constellation. The Quadrantid meteor shower is only visible in the Northern Hemisphere due to its position in the sky, but those who are able to see the event will likely have the best chance of spotting meteors just before dawn on 4 January. The event actually began on 26 December and is set to continue until 16 January, but according to EarthSky the predicted peak is 7:53 a.m. EST tomorrow. This makes the hours between 4:53 a.m. EST and dawn the best time to catch a glimpse of some of the shooting stars in [North America](https://www.unilad.com/us-news). In western regions, the best chance to witness the event will be earlier at night. The meteor shower can be seen with the naked eye. Credit: Fatih Kurt/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Unfortunately, a bright last quarter moon set to rise tonight will make viewing the shower more difficult, but looking up at the sky from a dark place away from artificial lighting should hopefully make the fireballs easier to spot. Those wanting to see the shower are advised to be patient and observe the sky with a naked eye, as binoculars and telescopes can narrow the field of vision. If you're not able to get out to do some stargazing in person, the Virtual Telescope Project is hosting a [live stream of the event](https://www.virtualtelescope.eu/2022/12/30/the-2023-quadrantid-meteor-shower-online-observation-4-jan-2023). Meteor showers take place when Earth passes through the debris of a comet or asteroid, and pieces of the debris enter the Earth's atmosphere. The speed at which the debris travels causes it to burn up when it hits the atmosphere, resulting in the recognizable break streaks of light across the sky. The parent object of the Quadrantids is a rocky asteroid or 'dead comet' known as 2003 EH1, which was discovered in 2003. The shower is one of four major showers that take place each year with a sharp peak, including the Lyrids, Leonids, and Ursids.

Then, referees ruled that Argentina had been offside on the goal and it was disallowed. After another three minutes of added time following the long delay, Morocco claimed a 2-1 victory.\nArgentina’s soccer federation said it issued a formal protest to world governing body FIFA to “take the necessary regulatory measures for such a serious event.”\n“Paris 2024 is working with the relevant stakeholders to understand the causes and identify appropriate actions,” a spokesperson for Paris organizers said.\nBefore Wednesday’s match, Argentina men’s soccer coach Javier Mascherano said the team’s Olympic training base was robbed.\n“They went into training and they robbed us, in the Olympic Games,” Mascherano said. “We didn’t want to say anything after training, I don’t think it helps anything. But obviously it’s a bit disagreeable that these kinds of things happen.”\nMascherano said midfielder Thiago Almada’s watch was among the items taken.\nMeanwhile, there is no Olympic event for drag queens, but that didn’t stop the Paris organizers from recruiting one to carry the Olympic torch.\nWhy would anyone watch the woke Paris Olympics.\nPassing of the torch is ruined by gender politics. pic.twitter.com/Xc79lpbBWH\n— Citizen Free Press (@CitizenFreePres) July 25, 2024\nUrgent : Support Free Press Foundation",

    "text": "A startup run by Tim Stokely, founder of adult content social media site OnlyFans, has partnered with a cryptocurrency foundation to submit a late-stage plan to acquire short video app TikTok from Chinese owner ByteDance, the two said on Wednesday.\nThe intent to bid was sent this week to the White House by Zoop, billionaire Stokely's new company, and the Hbar Foundation, which manages the Hedera cryptocurrency network's treasury.\nWhile OnlyFans is known mainly for pornography, Zoop is mainstream and family-friendly, and gives back the majority of its revenue to those who post on the site, rewarding them for driving up user engagement.\n\"Our bid for TikTok isn't just about changing ownership, it's about creating a new paradigm where both creators and their communities benefit directly from the value they generate,\" Zoop co-founder RJ Phillips told Reuters.\nThe partners have been working with a consortium of investors, Phillips said. He declined to provide details on the bid or the investors backing it.\nOn Wednesday, Amazon also put in a last-minute offer to buy TikTok, the New York Times reported.\nU.S. President Donald Trump is expected on Wednesday to consider a proposal for TikTok to decide the fate of the app used by 170 million Americans. ByteDance faces an April 5 deadline to either sell TikTok or face a U.S. ban on national security grounds under a U.S. law that took effect on January 19.\nThe law, passed last year with broad bipartisan support, reflects concern in Washington that TikTok's ownership makes it beholden to the Chinese government and that Beijing could use the app to conduct influence operations against the United States.\nTikTok advocates argue that the ban unlawfully threatens to restrict Americans from accessing foreign media in violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech.\nTrump postponed enforcement of the law until April 5 after taking office in January to give himself time to shepherd a deal. He has said he could extend the deadline further if needed.\nThe talks on TikTok have coalesced around a planfor the biggest non-Chinese investors in ByteDance to raise their stakes and acquire the app's U.S. operations, Reuters has reported.\nTrump said last month his administration was in touch withfour different groupsabout a prospective TikTok deal, without identifying them.\nIn the closely watched sale of TikTok, the White House is playing the role of an investment bank, with U.S. Vice President JD Vance running the auction.\n(Reporting from Anna Tong in San Francisco; Editing by Kenneth Li and Richard Chang)\nOpen Modal × $(document).ready(function(){ var freeBoxShow = false; $(window).scroll(function() { var scrollPercent = 100 * $(window).scrollTop() / ($(document).height() - $(window).height()); window.setTimeout(function () { //scroll to page length 35% then show the pop-up if (scrollPercent >= 35 && !freeBoxShow) { freeBoxShow = true; $('#freeHTMLBoxBtn').click(); } }, 500); }); var freeModal = document.getElementById(\"freeModal\"); $(\"#freeHTMLBoxBtn\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"block\"; //$('body').addClass('free-modal-open'); }); $(\".free-close\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"none\"; //$('body').removeClass('free-modal-open'); }); var freeBox = '",
