    "title": "Stanislav Kondrashov Telf AG: on the prospects of the Australian iron ore industry | Markets | bigspringherald.com",
    "text": "For many years, Australia's Pilbara region has been a symbol of rapid growth and prosperity in the mining industry. Located in Western Australia, it has served as the country's main economic engine for decades, drawing on its rich iron ore reserves. Huge piles of crushed brown rock, up to 200,000 tons each, ready to be shipped to Asian steel mills were a common sight at the port of Parker Point. However, today, according to an expert in the field of metallurgy, Stanislav Kondrashov, the region is facing new challenges: the fading of the Chinese infrastructure boom and the need to transition to more environmentally friendly technologies.\nStanislav Kondrashov: fading Chinese demand for iron ore and its impact on the Pilbara economy\nChina, which consumes about 85% of Australia's iron ore, has a huge impact on the economy of the Pilbara, a region that has long been the main source of this raw material. However, recent trends in the Chinese economy and real estate sector are beginning to put pressure on this traditional export route.\nAccording to Stanislav Kondrashov from Telf AG, demand for steel in China has been stable and high for a long time, but now it is approaching its peak. China's steel production is expected to peak before the end of the current decade. This is largely due to a slowdown in the real estate sector, which is one of the largest consumers of steel in the country.\nThe crisis in China's real estate sector, which traditionally used much of its steel production, has led to a decrease in demand for steel. This in turn impacts Australian iron ore import requirements, inevitably leading to lower export earnings for the Pilbara.\nWith demand for iron ore falling in China, the Pilbara economy faces a number of challenges. Since the region is heavily dependent on iron ore exports, Stanislav Kondrashov from Telf AG is confident that it is necessary to look for alternative markets or develop other sectors of the economy to compensate for possible losses:\nTo overcome these challenges, the region will need to diversify its economic activities. This could include developing other sectors such as tourism or renewable energy, as well as finding new markets for iron ore exports outside China .\nStanislav Kondrashov: environmental challenges and innovations\nModern steel production, which has not changed since the 14th century, is a high-carbon process. In search of a solution to this problem, alternative technologies are being developed, such as electric arc furnaces and direct reduction of iron using natural gas. According to Stanislav Kondrashov, in the long term it is planned to use “green” hydrogen, which will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the steel production process.\nTypical Australian iron ore has an iron content of between 56% and 62%, making it less suitable for new technologies without further processing. This could increase costs by 25%, according to analysts at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. Such changes will inevitably impact the competitiveness of the Australian iron ore industry in the global market.\nIn the face of these challenges, the Australian iron ore industry must adapt, not only technologically but also strategically. This requires innovation, rethinking production processes and possibly diversifying markets. The road ahead is difficult, but it is precisely periods like these that often become an effective catalyst for major industrial and economic transformations, - Kondrashov says. Reimagining the future of Australia's iron ore industry is not just a necessity, but an opportunity for innovation and sustainable development. The Pilbara and the entire Australian iron ore industry now stand on the threshold of a new era that will determine their place in the global economy of the future.\nMedia Contact\nCompany Name: Telf AG\nContact Person: Media Relations\nEmail: Send Email\nCountry: Switzerland\nWebsite: https://telf.ch/\nData & News supplied by www.cloudquote.io\nStock quotes supplied by Barchart\nQuotes delayed at least 20 minutes.\nBy accessing this page, you agree to the following\nPrivacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .",

    "text": "Darnell Nurse has a surprising car collection. Nurse is a defenseman for the [Edmonton Oilers](/nhl/edmonton-oilers) after they selected him seventh overall at the 2013 NHL Draft. If he's not playing for the Oilers, Nurse plays for the Canadian national team on the international stage.\nThe Oilers star has been playing for the national team since his youth days, taking bronze medals at the U17 World Championship and IIHF U18 World Championship. He also helped Canada win gold at the Hlinka Gretzky Cup and the IIHF World Junior Championship.\nAt the senior level, Nurse has continued to make his country proud. He helped Canada finish fourth at the 2018 Ice Hockey World Championship. A year later, they improved their finish by taking home the silver medal.\nGiven Nurse's contributions to hockey, have you ever wondered what kind of cars an NHL star like him drives? Well, wonder no more. This article features Darnell Nurse's surprising $90K car collection, with photos.\nHe has [earned nearly $53 million](https://www.spotrac.com/nhl/player/_/id/13452/darnell-nurse#:~:text=2022%2D2029%20Extension,a%20cap%20hit%20of%20%249%2C250%2C000.) in his career after [Nurse signed an eight-year, $74 million contract extension with the Oilers](https://clutchpoints.com/oilers-news-star-defenseman-darnell-nurse-8-year-74-million-extension) in 2021. Thanks to a respectable career in the NHL, it isn't surprising that the Oilers player can afford to live in luxury. This includes owning some lavish rides.\nHowever, unlike other professional athletes, it seems that Nurse likes to keep his car collection small. Nurse only [owns a pair of rides](https://21motoring.com/darnell-nurse-car-collection-2023-cars-of-darnell-nurse/#more-56194). Nonetheless, both cars are considered dream cars by many people around the world.\n2. Mercedes-Benz C-Class\nThe cheapest car in Nurse's collection is the Mercedes-Benz C-Class. For this luxury sedan, the Canadian national team mainstay shelled out around $44,990.\nAlthough it's the less pricey car in her garage, there's no doubt that the Mercedes-Benz C-Class is one of the best sedans in the market. Staying true to the brand, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class finds a way to marry both style and performance. In fact, it's easily an icon of class and luxury that becomes an instant head turner on the streets.\nAside from a sporty look that catches anyone's attention on the streets, this top-of-the-line sedan also possesses a handful of interior amenities, including premium leather seats, a massive screen, and plenty of other advanced tech.\nThis should provide Nurse with some comfortable rides, especially coming after a tough training session or game. Furthermore, cruising around the city should get a lot better with the Mercedes-Benz C-Class.\nThe Mercedes-Benz C-Class gets its power from a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine. This allows it to produce 192 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. On the other hand, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class has no problems when it comes to speed. This premium sedan can also go as fast as 135 mph with the assistance of a nine-speed transmission.\nGiven the features of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, it's safe to say that this top-of-the line sedan still deserves a special place in his garage even if it's the less pricey vehicle.\n1. Ford Mustang\nThe most expensive car in Nurse's car collection is a Ford Mustang, which costs around $45,000. The Mustang is truly a powerful vehicle that easily stands out on the streets.\nIn fact, the Ice Hockey World Champion silver medalist certainly loves turning some heads when he takes out this muscle car for a spin thanks to its distinct roar that makes it one of the most coveted cars in the market. Moreover, any car collector will agree that the Mustang is worth every penny.\nIn terms of features, the Mustang boasts of a timeless exterior that never goes out of style. It's aggressiveness and sporty look is one of the main attractions of the Mustang.\nOn the other hand, any driver will surely have a pleasant driving experience with the Mustang as it certainly has no shortage of power. Moreover, its lavish interior should provide a driving experience to any rider like no other regular car. Overall, it's easy to see why the Oilers star just had to pick one up for himself.\nThe Mustang derives its power from a 5.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine. It produces 400 horsepower and 515 lb-ft of torque. Furthermore, equipped with a seven-speed automated manual transmission, it easily can reach a full speed of 165 mph.\nOn the other hand, it has no problems with acceleration. In fact, the Mustang is capable of going from 0 to 60 mph in just a little more than three seconds with ease.\nNevertheless, this is all the information that we have on Darnell Nurse's surprising $90K car collection.",

    "text": "Ottawa’s drastic immigration cuts have sent shockwaves across Canada even though a growing number of Canadians are saying the country has accepted too many newcomers amid a stagnant economy and rising cost of living. Over the past year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government has signalled the need to rein in the surge of international students and temporary foreign workers, but the sharp reduction in permanent immigration was a first after years of steady increases by successive governments since the early 1990s. The pulling back of the welcome mat has surprised many observers from advocates to the business sector, immigration lawyers and politicians, adding further uncertainty in an already volatile system for migrants and over what impacts the cuts would have on the labour market, economy and demographics in both short and long terms. “In the tumultuous times as we emerged from the pandemic between addressing labour needs and maintaining population growth, we didn’t get the balance quite right,” Trudeau told reporters in unveiling [the new immigration plan](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/notices/supplementary-immigration-levels-2025-2027.html) on Thursday. “Immigration is essential for Canada’s future, but it must be controlled and it must be sustainable. With today’s annual immigration plan, that is precisely what we’re doing.” Under the plan, Canada will reduce its annual intake of permanent residents by 21 per cent to 395,000 next year, 380,000 in 2026 and 365,000 in 2027 — following similar trends in other major immigration countries such as the U.K. and Australia. The announcement came just days after a long-term tracking poll by Environics Institute [found 58 per cent of Canadians said there’s too much immigration](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/clear-majority-of-canadians-now-say-theres-too-much-immigration/article_4d60afbe-8c8e-11ef-9ad4-df0258692913.html) — the first time in a quarter-century that a clear majority of respondents share that view. The share of skilled and economic permanent residents will be about 60 per cent, followed by those in family reunification (24 per cent) and the rest, about 16 per cent, will be from the humanitarian and refugee stream. Canada’s temporary population including international students and foreign workers will also be slashed by 445,901 in 2025, 445,662 in 2026 but increased modestly by 17,439 in 2027. Canada’s population is inching toward 42 million by year end, up from 38 million in 2019, [growth primarily attributed to immigration](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/canada-is-getting-bigger-are-we-setting-the-country-and-its-newest-citizens-up-for/article_ea2d0580-9f24-5aca-83ad-24c06e6c126a.html), which was [key to Ottawa’s economic recovery strategy after the pandemic](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/canada-plans-record-levels-of-immigration-in-roadmap-to-post-covid-19-economic-recovery/article_9855e6fd-26f1-513f-9d60-c37cdb3480ce.html). Over the five-year period, the annual targets for new permanent residents rose to 485,000 from 330,800. The plan is expected to result in a population decline of 0.2 per cent in each of the next two years before returning to a population growth of 0.8 per cent in 2027, by which time about 670,000 fewer housing units would be required, said Immigration Minister Marc Miller. Diana Palmerin-Velasco, a director of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said the business community understands the need for a sustainable immigration system but is concerned about the plan’s implications on the labour market. “It seems that the government might be overreacting,” she said. “It’s not just 100,000 fewer permanent residents. We are also expecting to see 400,000 fewer temporary residents. We are talking about 500,000 people.” The cuts to permanent resident levels are affecting all immigration programs. The federal economic immigration class — where applicants are primarily from abroad — is the hardest hit, with its permanent resident spots cut by 60 per cent next year. The provincial immigration programs that allow provinces to hand-pick skilled newcomers to fill regional gaps will be cut to 55,000 from 120,000. The cuts to the provincial programs will impede Ontario’s ability to bring in as many skilled trades workers to build more housing, transit and expand highways, said David Piccini, minister of labour, immigration, training and skills development. “They’ve created a problem. They’re attempting to fix it,” he said, referring to the federal government. “What I do fundamentally disagree with is doing it on the backs of our provincial nominee program, which is Ontario’s strongest tool to bring in skilled trades women and men, and in health-care professions like nurses” and personal support workers. Since it was elected in 2015, the government had raised annual permanent resident targets from 272,000 to 485,000 this year, with the biggest jump in 2021 to 401,000 when the border reopened after the pandemic and Ottawa resorted to immigration as an economic stimulant. Rules were relaxed to welcome more international students and temporary foreign workers to fill immediate labour shortages, with job vacancies reaching one million in 2022. As hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians sought temporary refuge from the Russian invasion, Canada saw its temporary resident population skyrocket from 924,850 to over three million, or 7.2 per cent of the overall population today. Since last November, Ottawa started imposing new rules on study and work permits in an attempt to rein in the number of international students and foreign workers. It has capped the number of new study permits issued and set a target of reducing the temporary residents’ share of the overall population to five per cent over three years. “Today’s immigration flip-flop is a massive admission of failure by Justin Trudeau,” said Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. “Trudeau has suddenly admitted that radical, uncontrolled immigration and policies related to it are partly to blame for joblessness, housing and health-care crises.” Scotiabank economist Rebekah Young said the drastic cuts to both permanent and temporary immigration are going to have a near-term macro impact on the economy, and there will be trade-offs. “They are a source of labour supply and they provide economic activity through the workforce, but they also consume,” said Young. “We’re likely left with lower GDP, but not necessarily a stronger trajectory for the growth outlook.” While a tighter labour market may provide incentives for businesses to invest in technology, research and capital, it would also be disruptive to the economy, she said. On Thursday, Miller said the department will prioritize the transition of temporary residents in Canada by allocating 40 per cent of the permanent spots in 2025 to migrants already studying and working here. There will also be a smaller-scale regularization plan to grant legal status to undocumented migrants. “These people are a young labour pool. They are skilled. They’re here,” he told reporters. “They’ve begun the process of integration and it doesn’t place the additional demands on the housing, health-care and social services that we see with someone that comes directly from another country.” Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said the cuts are troubling to employers and small businesses. “A restaurant owner who can’t find a cook ready and willing to work in their community will not have work for the Canadians who may work in the front of the house,” he said. “We need to rethink many of these recent changes and be ready to turn the dial back up.” In an open letter, a coalition of more than 100 community groups expressed disappointment in the reduction in temporary and permanent immigration. “This government was elected on a pro-immigration platform and promised permanent resident status for migrant workers, students and undocumented people at the start of the current mandate,” it said. “Not delivering on them will be remembered at the ballot box.” The cuts mean migrants will be forced to remain temporary or become undocumented, and pushed further into exploitative jobs and conditions, said Syed Hussan of the Migrant Rights Network. The Canadian Immigration Lawyers Association called the pullback a “dark day” for Canada, warning of economic, fiscal and social damage. “We still have an aging population, low birth rate, and pressing economic and fiscal pressures,” said Barbara Jo Caruso, its co-president. “Canada’s fundamental need for immigration has not changed.” Diana Gallego, president of the Canadian Council for Refugees, said behind the numbers slashed from the humanitarian component of the levels are 14,000 real people struggling under persecution or in conflict zones around the world. “Canada has betrayed the world’s refugees,” she said.
