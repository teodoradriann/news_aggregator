    "title": "Risks Still Elevated At These Prices As Studio Mir Co., LTD (KOSDAQ:408900) Shares Dive 32%",
    "text": "South Korea- /\nEntertainment- /\n- KOSDAQ:A408900\nRisks Still Elevated At These Prices As Studio Mir Co., LTD (KOSDAQ:408900) Shares Dive 32%\nThe Studio Mir Co., LTD (KOSDAQ:408900) share price has softened a substantial 32% over the previous 30 days, handing back much of the gains the stock has made lately. The recent drop completes a disastrous twelve months for shareholders, who are sitting on a 69% loss during that time.\nAlthough its price has dipped substantially, given around half the companies in Korea's Entertainment industry have price-to-sales ratios (or \"P/S\") below 1.5x, you may still consider Studio Mir as a stock to avoid entirely with its 4.8x P/S ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/S.\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n Check out our latest analysis for Studio Mir\nWhat Does Studio Mir's Recent Performance Look Like?\nAs an illustration, revenue has deteriorated at Studio Mir over the last year, which is not ideal at all. It might be that many expect the company to still outplay most other companies over the coming period, which has kept the P/S from collapsing. However, if this isn't the case, investors might get caught out paying too much for the stock.\nWant the full picture on earnings, revenue and cash flow for the company? Then ourfree report on Studio Mirwill help you shine a light on its historical performance.\nWhat Are Revenue Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/S?\nThe only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/S as steep as Studio Mir's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the industry decidedly.\nTaking a look back first, the company's revenue growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 24%. Regardless, revenue has managed to lift by a handy 22% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the earlier period of growth. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would be roughly satisfied with the medium-term rates of revenue growth.\nComparing the recent medium-term revenue trends against the industry's one-year growth forecast of 16% shows it's noticeably less attractive.\nWith this information, we find it concerning that Studio Mir is trading at a P/S higher than the industry. Apparently many investors in the company are way more bullish than recent times would indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock at any price. Only the boldest would assume these prices are sustainable as a continuation of recent revenue trends is likely to weigh heavily on the share price eventually.\nThe Bottom Line On Studio Mir's P/S\nEven after such a strong price drop, Studio Mir's P/S still exceeds the industry median significantly. We'd say the price-to-sales ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.\nThe fact that Studio Mir currently trades on a higher P/S relative to the industry is an oddity, since its recent three-year growth is lower than the wider industry forecast. Right now we aren't comfortable with the high P/S as this revenue performance isn't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. Unless there is a significant improvement in the company's medium-term performance, it will be difficult to prevent the P/S ratio from declining to a more reasonable level.\nDon't forget that there may be other risks. For instance, we've identified 3 warning signs for Studio Mir (1 is potentially serious) you should be aware of.\nIf companies with solid past earnings growth is up your alley, you may wish to see this free collection of other companies with strong earnings growth and low P/E ratios.\nNew: Manage All Your Stock Portfolios in One Place\nWe've created the ultimate portfolio companion for stock investors, and it's free.\n• Connect an unlimited number of Portfolios and see your total in one currency\n• Be alerted to new Warning Signs or Risks via email or mobile\n• Track the Fair Value of your stocks\nTry a Demo Portfolio for Free\nHave feedback on this article?

    "text": "The empowerment of women is set to strengthen our democracy Summary - The participation of women in electoral exercises has risen impressively and could outstrip that of men within this decade. Women represent half the world’s population and are still largely excluded from political decision making. In India’s Lok Sabha elections, the number of women contestants seats increased from 3% of all parliamentary candidates in 1957 to 6% in 2009 and further to 9% in 2019, the last such polls held. The representation of women in the Lok Sabha, meanwhile, has increased from 4.5% in 1957 to 10.9% in 2009 and further to 14.4% in 2019. The numbers make it clear that political representation in the country is dominated by men. It will take a lot more effort to increase the participation of women, which is a very important aspect of women’s empowerment in general.

    "text": "Fantastic weekend weather, slightly cooler temperatures next week BATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - Today’s Outlook: Much of the same remains today as we start off our weekend with another cool morning in the low to mid 60s. Once again, expect temperatures to quickly warm to the low 90s by the afternoon underneath clear sunny skies. Today’s high should top out right around the 90 degrees. Temperatures should fall nicely into the low to mid 80s for LSU v. Ole Miss kickoff in Tiger Stadium. Clear skies remain and throughout the game allowing for temperatures will make their way down into the 70s, making for a cool and comfortable evening. The next fall front Daytime highs are still warm in the low 90s through Monday, which is above normal for this time of year. Another cold front looks to arrive on Tuesday, helping to usher in another round of dry and cool air from the north. High temperatures fall below normal, possibly as low as the upper 70s, and mornings as cool as the low 50s. Extended Outlook The stretch of pleasant sunny and dry days remains through the next work week. Afternoon temperatures stay in the low 90s through Monday ahead of our next fall front to help cool us down slightly below normal for the middle latter part of next week. Rain chances don’t come back into the forecast until beyond the next seven days into next weekend and early next week. [Click here](mailto:typo@wafb.com) to report a typo.

    "text": "The North Carolina Tar Heels rolled past the San Diego State Aztecs in their First Four matchup on Tuesday night, with the final score settling in at 95-68. However, just because they won doesn't mean that Jay Bilas feels any differently about North Carolina's inclusion in the 2025 NCAA Tournament.\nThe Tar Heels were among the most controversial picks for the bracket this year, as folks felt they were undeserving of earning a bid for the tournament. Their athletic director, Bubba Cunningham, (who is also the chairman of the NCAA Tournament selection committee) addressed the decision after facing backlash from fans.\n\"The last four teams that were out ... it was a tough call,\" Cunningham said. \"The next team out was West Virginia, and they had an outstanding year and, unfortunately, knowing Tucker DeVries was hurt, player availability is something that we talk about quite a bit. Indiana was close, Ohio State was close, Boise (State) was close.\"\nFor one game at least, the Tar Heels looked like they belonged in the tournament. In Bilas' eyes, though, one win doesn't justify their inclusion in the bracket of 64 teams, especially when considering several other worthy teams were passed over in favor of North Carolina.\n\"What happens in the tournament doesn't validate your inclusion, and it doesn't say that if a No. 1 seed loses in the first or second round that they didn't belong in the tournament or didn't deserve their No. 1 seed, it's based on your body of work,\" Bilas said on \"First Take.\"\n\"What happens in the tournament doesn't validate your inclusion.\"\n— First Take (@FirstTake)[@JayBilas]and[@MadDogUnleashed]on if UNC proved that they belong in the NCAA tournament after their win against San Diego State.[pic.twitter.com/Y3jUgJrWn4][March 19, 2025]\nChances are the Tar Heels won't care too much what people are saying about them, so long as they keep on winning. They will have another shot to prove they belong in the NCAA Tournament when they take on the Ole Miss Rebels in their Round of 64 matchup on Friday, March 21 at 4:05 p.m. EST.\nMore must-reads:\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.
