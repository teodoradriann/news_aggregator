    "title": "Cruise ship rescues 68 migrants drifting off Spain’s Canary Islands",
    "text": "By Sharon Braithwaite, CNN (CNN) — A luxury cruise ship rescued 68 migrants drifting off the Spanish Canary Islands on Wednesday, Spain’s maritime rescue agency said in a statement on X. The bulk carrier Philipp Oldendorff spotted a canoe-shaped boat adrift with people on board roughly 440 nautical miles, or about 815 km, south of Tenerife, and provided first aid to those affected while passenger ship Insignia was sent to the area, the Salvamento Maritimo statement said. The Insignia, owned by Oceania Cruises, rescued a total of 68 people and recovered three bodies, the agency said, adding that it could not recover the remains of two people due to poor weather conditions. On Thursday, Insignia’s crew reported that one of the rescued migrants was in critical condition and needed to be evacuated. He died before a search and rescue helicopter could reach him, the agency said. The 62 men, three women and three minors rescued were from sub-Sahara Africa, according to the Insignia’s report to the agency. “Safety of life at sea is of paramount importance for all seafarers,” an Oceania Cruises spokesperson told CNN via email. “We can confirm that Insignia rescued 68 people from a vessel in distress between Cape Verde and Tenerife and bought them onboard for medical assistance and provided food, drinks, clothing and a safe place to rest. We have coordinated next steps with authorities in Tenerife, and they will be taking over the care of the rescued people,” the spokesperson added. The 670-guest Insignia is currently sailing its 180-day Around-The-World cruise. Data from Spain’s Interior ministry show a drastic increase of the number of migrants arriving by sea, especially to the Canary Islands. According to Spain’s Interior ministry, between January 1 and June 15, 23,037 migrants have arrived in Spain by sea, a 122.6% increase compared to the same period last year. Of those, 18,977 have arrived to the Canary Islands by sea — an increase of 220.9% compared to the same period last year. Earlier this month Spanish NGO Caminando Fronteras said that at least 5,000 migrants have died trying to reach Spain this year between January and May, an average of 33 people per day.

    "text": "Alemania.- La gimnasta checa Natalie Stichova, de 23 años, murió trágicamente en un accidente mientras intentaba hacerse un “selfie” en una montaña de 80 metros de altura en Baviera, Alemania. El incidente ocurrió el 15 de agosto, pero la terrible noticia has trascendido ahora.\nNatalie Stichova estaba visitando el Castillo de Neuschwanstein, situado en la montaña Tegelberg, con su familia. En un intento por capturar el momento realizando una de sus acrobacias, la joven perdió el equilibrio y cayó al vacío. Aunque los servicios de emergencia la rescataron con vida, las graves lesiones cerebrales que sufrió resultaron ser irreversibles, y su fallecimiento se confirmó el martes 27 de agosto.\nEl club Sokol Pribram Sports Gymnastics, donde Stichova entrenaba, ha emitido un comunicado lamentando profundamente la pérdida de la gimnasta. «Natalie repartió sonrisas a lo largo de su corta vida y así la recordaremos por siempre. Extendemos nuestro más sentido pésame a su familia y amigos cercanos, enviándoles fuerza y apoyo en estos momentos tan difíciles», señala el comunicado.\nLa madre de Natalie, profundamente afectada por la tragedia, expresó su dolor en las redes sociales con un emotivo mensaje: «Ella era increíble, todos la queríamos mucho y nunca dejaremos de quererla. Estoy orgullosa de que fueras mi hija, la niña de mis sueños. Me enseñaste tanto. Ojalá pudieras enseñarme más».",

    "text": "A bill that would establish a long-term care (LTC) insurance plan at the federal level has been reintroduced in the House of Representatives . Its chief sponsor has received bipartisan support and is hitting the road to communicate its potential benefits to constituents.\nLast month, Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.) reintroduced the Well-Being Insurance for Seniors to be at Home (WISH) Act, which would amend Social Security to provide long-term care benefits for program participants. The bill’s co-sponsor is Rep. John Moolenaar (R-Mich.).\nIn an effort to get the word out, Suozzi held an event in Washington, D.C. , earlier this month to describe the plan to constituents.\nThe event included “over 100 healthcare experts, insurers, elder advocates, caregiver organizations and policymakers from across the aisle to address America’s looming long-term care crisis,” Suozzi’s office said.\n“There’s a storm coming,” Suozzi explained in a prepared statement. “Every day, 10,000 Americans turn 65, and in five years, 6,500 Americans will reach 80 every single day.\n“Our nursing homes and Medicaid system cannot deal with this. We don’t have enough nursing home beds, we can’t afford it, and seniors would prefer to age at home .”\nThe act would seek to create a new public-private partnership between the federal government and the insurance industry, according to the text of the bill . It would establish “a monthly federal benefit for Americans who become disabled in old age, after a 1- to 5-year elimination period based on income,” Suozzi’s office said.\nWithin that period, potential beneficiaries would be required to rely on private insurance programs or “personal resources” with a two-pronged goal: to provide coverage for those with the greatest determined need, and to “create new incentives for private insurers to offer affordable long-term care products.”\nThe legislation would “establish a federal catastrophic long-term care insurance program, designed to help disabled seniors age with dignity in their own homes — while reinvigorating the private long-term care insurance market,” Suozzi’s office said.\nSo far, Suozzi and Moolenaar are the only sponsors in the House. But Moolenaar described what led to his support for the measure.\n“What I like about the WISH Act is that it really tries to engage a lot of stakeholders,” he said. “To me, that’s a win-win because we want to make sure our seniors are getting the best care possible. We want to make sure people don’t have to choose between poverty and losing all their life savings and they can’t qualify for different care.\n“We want to make sure that individuals who don’t have families who can take care of them have a place and can be provided for,” he added. “This really is common sense, it’s bipartisan, it’s something that encourages people to do the right thing.”\nAccording to Suozzi’s office, the organizations that have voiced support for the bill thus far include the National Council on Aging , the American College of Physicians , American Geriatrics Society , the National Alliance for Caregiving and Genworth Financial .\nSuozzi previously introduced a version of the WISH Act in mid-2021, but the bill never garnered a co-sponsor and did not progress beyond committee referrals during that session.",

    "title": "El Grupo Banco Mundial se propone ampliar los servicios de salud a 1500 millones de personas",
    "text": "Se busca lograr mayor asequibilidad y ampliar la cobertura geográfica y el alcance de los servicios CIUDAD DE WASHINGTON, 18 de abril de 2024. El Grupo Banco Mundial anunció hoy un ambicioso plan para ayudar a los países a brindar servicios de salud asequibles y de calidad a 1500 millones de personas para 2030. Esto forma parte de un esfuerzo global más amplio dirigido a ofrecer un estándar básico de atención en todas las etapas de la vida: infancia, niñez, adolescencia y adultez. Durante décadas, el Grupo Banco Mundial ha contribuido a proporcionar servicios de salud a mujeres y niños en más de 100 países. Ahora, gracias a un esfuerzo particularmente orientado a lograr mayor rapidez, trabajar mejor con los asociados y atraer al sector privado, esta institución de 80 años de antigüedad puede buscar mayor escala y mayor impacto. La estrategia que se aplicará para llegar a 1500 millones de personas se basa en tres elementos fundamentales: - Ampliar el foco más allá de la salud maternoinfantil para brindar cobertura a lo largo de toda la vida de una persona e incluir también las enfermedades no transmisibles. - Extender las operaciones hacia zonas de difícil acceso, como aldeas, ciudades y países remotos. - Trabajar con los Gobiernos para reducir los aranceles innecesarios y otros obstáculos financieros a la atención de la salud. Para alcanzar este objetivo, se contabilizarán únicamente las personas que hayan sido atendidas y tratadas por un trabajador de la salud a través de una visita presencial o una teleconsulta. “Proporcionar a las personas un estándar básico de atención durante toda su vida es fundamental para el desarrollo”, dijo Ajay Banga, presidente del Grupo Banco Mundial. “Esta aspiración no podrá hacerse realidad con un esfuerzo individual. Se necesitarán socios, una coalición de los sectores público y privado que trabaje en conjunto para ampliar el acceso a los servicios de atención de la salud”. En la actualidad, unos 2000 millones de personas enfrentan graves dificultades financieras cuando deben pagar servicios de salud. Una serie de desafíos interrelacionados, como el cambio climático, las pandemias, los conflictos, el envejecimiento de la sociedad y un déficit proyectado de 10 millones de trabajadores de la salud para 2030 exacerban el ciclo de la pobreza y la desigualdad. El Grupo Banco Mundial combinará financiamiento, conocimientos y alianzas para abordar este desafío. Y podrá hacer uso de todos los elementos que conforman su capacidad financiera en función de las necesidades y de la etapa de desarrollo específicas de cada país para llegar a 1500 millones de personas. En el caso de los países más necesitados, la ayuda financiera de la Asociación Internacional de Fomento permitirá llevar trabajadores de la salud a comunidades que de otro modo no tendrían acceso a los servicios. En los países de ingreso mediano, el Banco Internacional de Reconstrucción y Fomento suministrará financiamiento para incentivar las inversiones públicas en salud y la promulgación de normas que favorezcan los avances. Con certidumbre regulatoria y una gestión institucional confiable, se abre la puerta a un mayor volumen de inversiones del sector privado, en especial en la producción local de medicamentos y equipos de protección. Será fundamental que el Grupo del Banco Mundial establezca alianzas sólidas para lograr resultados en el área de la salud, puesto que no alcanzará su objetivo si no trabaja codo a codo —más rápido y mejor— con las organizaciones no gubernamentales, el sector privado y la sociedad civil. El Grupo Banco Mundial celebra el anuncio de que Japón pondrá en marcha un Centro de Conocimientos sobre la Cobertura Universal de Salud dirigido a mejorar la capacidad de los ministerios de Salud y Finanzas, iniciativa que cuenta con el apoyo del Banco y de la Organización Mundial de la Salud. El objetivo de brindar servicios de salud asequibles y de calidad a 1500 millones de personas para 2030 es uno de los ejemplos más recientes del compromiso del Grupo Banco Mundial de orientarse más a lograr impacto y el subproducto de un esfuerzo concertado por construir un Banco mejor.
