And the last thing that I want to do is come on here and fuel that more and just talk about it really, because it’s just not my coping mechanism.\n4 Molly-Mae Hague addresses her breakup with Tommy Fury in video on YouTube on August 29, 2024. YouTube/MollyMae “My coping mechanism for the last couple of weeks has been talking to the people that I love and are so close to me and have been so incredible through this time — and then going on here and sort of just pushing forward.”\nHague emphasized that she won’t “spill the tea” and reveal what happened.\nExplore More NHL star, brother struck and killed by car in NJ while riding bikes a day before sister's wedding Yankees stars, wives take in US Open action on night off Rutgers coach gets shade for running up score in blowout win “I don’t really ever plan on talking about the last couple of weeks,” she said. “It’s just not something I feel comfortable with … It is not drama, it is not tea, it is not a publicity stunt.

    "text": "Some Florida fuel terminals and a major refined products pipeline expect to restore operations over the weekend thanks to minimal damage from Hurricane Milton, but a return to normal in Port Tampa is being hampered by power outages. Kinder Morgan's Orlando terminal is operational but the company is still assessing its Tampa area terminals and the Central Florida Pipeline (CFPL) after Hurricane Milton made landfall as a category 3 storm late Wednesday, a spokesperson said at 3pm ET Friday. Kinder plans to have its Tampa fuels rack and 16-inch CFPL pipeline online by late Saturday and the 10-inch CFPL pipeline online by the end of the weekend. The company's three Tampa bulk terminals are likely to remain offline Friday due to widespread power outages and damage to the surrounding area. The CFPL pipeline transports gasoline, diesel, ethanol and jet fuel to Orlando, including to Orlando International Airport, and is connected to Kinder's Tampa refined products terminal that has 1.8mn bls of storage. Nearly half of Florida's supply of petroleum and refined products passes through Port Tampa Bay, the majority via waterborne cargo from the US Gulf coast. Port Tampa Bay is still assessing its land and seaside operations, port officials said this morning. It [re-opened for limited operations late Thursday](https://direct.argusmedia.com/newsandanalysis/article/2617565) having avoided widespread flooding, though power outages in the area remain an issue. Global Partners' Tampa terminal is without power and running on generators, the company said today. Employees are cleaning up minor damage and Global expects the facility to be \"fully operational soon\". Buckeye Partners' Jacksonville and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, terminals are fully operational and the company is working to restore operations at its two Tampa terminals, a Buckeye spokesperson said today. Chevron is repairing damage at its Tampa terminal, but did not give a time line for a return to normal operations. The company's Port Everglades and Panama City terminals are online and selling fuels, the company said today. Citgo expects its Tampa terminal to restore operations by mid-to-late next week, the company said today. The St Petersburg-Clearwater International airport (PIE) west of Port Tampa is expected to open at 4pm ET Friday according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport further south is expected to reopen early Saturday morning. Miami airport is open and Orlando International resumed commercial flights today. Prices for Florida CBOB delivered at Tampa and Port Everglades fell by 1.87¢/USG to $2.15/USG today. Cash differentials were stable in the Florida gasoline cargo markets at Argus Gulf coast Colonial CBOB +10¢/USG. Prices for Florida ULSD delivered to Port Everglades fell by 0.44¢/USG to $2.39/USG today.

    "text": "Exécution publique d’un prisonnier à Najafabad au bout de 8 ans de détention pour avoir tué un agent répressif en 2004 Sept exécutions mercredi Dans un acte odieux, le régime répressif en Iran a pendu en public un prisonnier ce jeudi 28 décembre à Najafabad accusé d’avoir tué un agent des forces répressives il y a près de 19 ans. Selon les médias officiels, le condamné et deux autres personnes accusées d’avoir tué cet agent dans un affrontement en 2004, avait été arrêtés en 2015. Après huit années de détention, il a été exécuté en public à Najafabad aujourd’hui. En outre, le mercredi 27 décembre, sept prisonniers ont été envoyés à la potence. Trois d’entre eux ont été identifiés comme étant Esmaïl Ghader-Magham (Barahoui), Ahmad Gorgij, et un autre parmi les compatriotes baloutches. Au même moment, Mohammad Hessari a été exécuté à la prison de Birjand, ainsi qu’Akbar Qareghozlou, Ehsan Hamidi et Ali Akbar à la prison de Qezelhessar. Le mardi 26 décembre, le condamné Mohammad Reza Mehraban a été pendu à la prison centrale de Sanandaj, et le 23 décembre, quatre prisonniers ont été exécutés à la prison centrale d’Ispahan. Les noms de deux d’entre eux avaient été annoncés dans un communiqué précédent, et les deux autres prisonniers s’appellent Shir Ali Saïd et Saman Mogoï. La montée des exécutions, notamment publiques, sert au régime des mollahs de moyen d’instiller la peur pour prévenir tout soulèvement potentiel. Garder le silence face à ces crimes inhumains va à l’encontre des principes bien établis des droits humains. La Résistance iranienne appelle les Nations unies, l’Union européenne et les organisations internationales concernées à prendre des mesures urgentes pour sauver la vie des condamnés à mort. Le guide suprême des mollahs Ali Khamenei, son président Ebrahim Raïssi et les autres dirigeants de ce régime doivent être tenus pour responsables de quatre décennies de crimes contre l’humanité et de génocide.

    "text": "HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (CBS12) — Police issued a warrant Thursday for a Hollywood man accused of animal cruelty he claims is part of his religious beliefs, records show. The investigation began in early December last year when the Hollywood Police Department responded to a complaint about dog fighting at the adjacent home of 38-year-old Jonathan Corraliza, according to the arrest warrant. The neighbor said this was an ongoing issue, and they had video to prove it, the warrant stated. An HPD officer arrived at the neighbor's home off Coolidge Street, and they showed him a two-minute video of three larger dogs attacking a small, gray pit bull puppy at a neighboring property, according to HPD. The officer watched as the three dogs bit and pulled at the puppy’s skin, dragging it around the yard. It was clear from the video the puppy was seriously injured, the warrant stated. He went to the house depicted in the neighbor’s video and saw for himself several dogs enclosed in the back yard, including a small, gray pit bull puppy that looked wounded from afar, police said. See also: [The Race For Annexation: Officials defend their motives](https://cbs12.com/news/cbs12-news-i-team/the-race-for-annexation-officials-defend-their-motives-charlie-hollings-coalition-against-lori-laverriere-palm-beach-gardens-florida) While the officer investigated, the dogs’ owner, Corraliza, arrived at the house. The officer was able to get a closer look at the dog, which had cornered itself in the fenced-in yard. He noted severe gashes causing the dog’s neck and ears to bleed, the warrant stated. The officer questioned Corraliza about the dog’s health, and Corraliza acknowledged he would take it to a veterinarian to have its wounds treated, according to the incident report. That evening, Hollywood Code Compliance Officer Joshua Ricky visited Corraliza’s house on 1507 Coolidge St. to offer services for the injured puppy, but no one answered, so he left a note at the address, the report stated. Two days later, police received another call from a neighbor worried about the health of a puppy at the same address. Rickey and other officers arrived at the house and found the same dog lying maimed and weak in the back yard with several injuries on its body, the report stated. “It appeared to Officer Rickey that without intervention, the dog was likely to succumb to her injuries,” HPD reported. Officers couldn’t touch the dog without it crying out in pain, they said. They took the puppy to the VCA Hollywood Animal Hospital on Hollywood Boulevard, all the while trying in vain to contact Corraliza. It wasn’t until the next evening on Dec. 10 when Corraliza called Rickey and said he did in fact take the dog to a veterinarian in Miami who said that it needed to be euthanized, according to the warrant. But he instead brought the puppy back to his house without treating it, Corraliza is reported to have said. Rickey pressed him on the name of the mentioned vet, but Corraliza reportedly hung up on him. Moments later, Rickey received a text from that same number stating that due to Corraliza’s religious beliefs in Santeria, he was “intentionally not providing medical attention to the dog and instead would heal the dog himself,” the report stated. If the dog wasn’t taken to the hospital when it was, it would have likely died of its many wounds and other ailments, including anemia, dehydration and hookworm infection, the veterinary hospital staff reportedly informed the officers. After the call with Rickey, Corraliza disappeared, according to a HPD media release. He was last seen in the Orlando area. Corraliza was charged with aggravated animal cruelty, and HPD urges the public to help locate him. If seen, they recommend contacting the department at 954-764-4357(HELP) or 954-967-4567. Tipsters can e-mail or text to hollywoodpdtips@hollywoodfl.org. Information can also be given to Broward Crime Stoppers at 954- 493-8477(TIPS) or browardcrimestoppers.org. The city was granted permission to remove the dog from the owner’s custody and transfer it to Paws2Care Coalition.",

    "title": "Estudiantes de arquitectura inventan un refugio para los sin techo inspirado en los viejos trolebuses estadounidenses",
    "text": "Para sustituir las tiendas de lona de las aldeas SOS de Denver, unos estudiantes de arquitectura han ideado unas pequeñas tiendas plegables de madera y lona aislante.\nEn un esfuerzo por ofrecer soluciones innovadoras y prácticas al creciente problema de las personas sin hogar, especialmente durante los meses más fríos, estudiantes de arquitectura de la Universidad de Colorado en Denver han desarrollado un nuevo tipo de alojamiento temporal inspirado en los históricos vagones Conestoga. Este proyecto, denominado «Conestoga Hut«, no solo busca reemplazar las tradicionales tiendas de lona con algo más duradero y protector, sino también ofrecer una solución económica para las personas en situación de calle.\nLa inspiración detrás de la Conestoga Hut\nLos estudiantes se inspiraron en los vagones Conestoga, utilizados durante la conquista del oeste americano, para diseñar estas pequeñas cabañas. Estas estructuras no solo proporcionan un recordatorio histórico sino que también ofrecen una solución práctica y eficiente para el alojamiento temporal. Cada cabaña está equipada con una puerta y una ventana con cerradura, además de suelos, paredes y techos aislados, lo que las convierte en una especie de «mini casa» para una sola persona. Su diseño modular permite un fácil montaje, desmontaje y transporte, convirtiéndolas en una alternativa asequible para albergar a personas sin hogar, con un costo aproximado de 2500€ por unidad, significativamente más bajo que las «tiny houses» o casas diminutas, que pueden costar alrededor de 10000€.\nOrigen y desarrollo del proyecto\nEl proyecto tomó vida en diciembre de 2020, como parte de un programa destinado a ayudar a las personas sin hogar. La iniciativa surgió cuando McSwain, uno de los líderes del proyecto, se acercó a la empresa CVC para construir mejores refugios en los sitios designados para el programa SOS. Inspirándose en un pueblo de Huts Conestoga ya en funcionamiento en Portland, el equipo propuso la idea a la ciudad de Denver, que aceptó el proyecto. Utilizando un enfoque de «paquete plano», las estructuras se diseñan para ser fácilmente transportables y montables, reduciendo así los costos y el impacto ambiental.\nLa importancia del código abierto\nMcSwain anunció que el proyecto se ofrecería en código abierto, permitiendo que cualquier organización acceda a los diseños y los utilice para construir más refugios. Esta decisión no solo facilita la reproducción del proyecto sino que también invita a futuros estudiantes de arquitectura a contribuir y mejorar el diseño.\nDesafíos y próximos pasos\nAunque la presentación oficial del proyecto fue bien recibida, surgieron preocupaciones sobre la resistencia de las estructuras a los fuertes vientos de Colorado y la temperatura interna durante extremos climáticos. El equipo de Freedom By Design está trabajando en estas mejoras antes de la aprobación final de CVC. La ciudad de Denver, mostrando su apoyo, ha extendido un contrato con la colaborativa de Colorado Village (CVC) y ha asignado 3.9 millones de dólares para instalar las cabañas en cuatro campamentos SOS.\nUn proyecto de amor y esperanza\nLos líderes del equipo, incluida Andrea Orejas, estudiante de posgrado en arquitectura, describen el proyecto como un «trabajo de amor» destinado a servir a la comunidad de Denver. Con la expectativa de superar los desafíos actuales y la aprobación pendiente de CVC, el equipo espera ver sus estructuras brindando refugio y seguridad a aquellos que más lo necesitan en un futuro cercano.\nEste proyecto no solo representa una solución práctica y económica para el alojamiento temporal de personas sin hogar, sino que también refleja el compromiso de los estudiantes con su comunidad y la innovación en el campo de la arquitectura. Con la posibilidad de adaptación y mejora continua, la «Conestoga Hut» promete ser un modelo a seguir en la búsqueda de soluciones habitacionales inclusivas y accesibles.\nVía\nColorado Village Collaborative",

    "text": "Arkansas Takes Bold Step Against PBM Ownership of Pharmacies\nLucas YoungUpdated: 04-16-2025 06:15 PM\nArkansas Enacts Landmark Law Against PBM Ownership\nIn a momentous decision benefiting patients and community pharmacies, a progressive law has been signed in Arkansas, marking an unprecedented shift in state pharmacy regulations. The recent legislation prohibits pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning or operating pharmacies within the state, effectively protecting public health and enhancing access to vital pharmacy care for Arkansans.\nThe Implications of HB 1150\nWith the approval of HB 1150, Arkansas has made a significant policy change that will reshape how pharmacies operate in the state starting January 1, 2026. This new law emerged from dedicated advocacy by organizations like the Arkansas Pharmacists Association (APA) and the National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA), both of which emphasized the negative impact of PBM ownership on community pharmacies.\nThe APA, representing the interests of Arkansas pharmacists, has tirelessly championed HB 1150's passage, highlighting the urgent need for reforms in the pharmacy landscape. Their efforts align with those of the NCPA, which has consistently sought to curb the anticompetitive practices associated with vertically integrated PBMs that often lead to patient harm and increased prescription drug prices.\nUnderstanding PBMs and Their Impact on Pharmacy Care\nPharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, have faced scrutiny for creating hurdles in patient care through abusive practices. These include imposing restrictive contract terms on independent pharmacies, clawbacks that undermine reimbursements, and controlling patient access, which stifles competition and hinders pharmacists' ability to provide high-quality service. The passage of HB 1150 aims to dismantle these barriers, paving the way for better patient outcomes.\n“This legislation marks a pivotal moment for pharmacies and patients alike,” said John Vinson, CEO of the APA. He emphasized that the bipartisan support for HB 1150 reflects a collective commitment to safeguard public health, ensuring that pharmacies affiliated with PBMs no longer exploit their position at the detriment of patients.\nNationwide Support for Reform\nFollowing Arkansas's lead, similar legislative actions concerning PBM ownership have emerged in states like Indiana, New York, Texas, and Vermont. Moreover, a bipartisan coalition of state attorneys general has voiced support for stringent reforms, urging federal lawmakers to adopt policies that prevent PBMs from owning or operating pharmacies. A recent bipartisan bill introduced in Congress highlights a growing recognition of the need to address the issues related to PBM ownership.\nAnne Cassity, NCPA’s Senior Vice President of Government Affairs, commented on the legislation's potential impact, stating, “The introduction of HB 1150 represents a vital step toward transparency and fair practices in pharmacy care. This structural change aims to eliminate the inherent conflicts of interest exploited by PBMs, benefiting patients and pharmacists across the nation.”\nThe Long Road to Pharmacy Reform\nThe path to instituting such measures has not been without challenges. Both the APA and NCPA have encountered resistance from powerful PBM entities resistant to substantive reforms. However, the overwhelming support for HB 1150 underscores a collective commitment among pharmacists, advocates, and legislators to change the status quo. The hope is that similar victories will soon be celebrated nationwide.\nFuture of Pharmacy Ownership in the U.S.\nThe passing of HB 1150 in Arkansas initiates a new chapter in the ongoing fight for pharmacy independence and patient access to care. By prohibiting PBM ownership, the state is setting a precedent that signals a shifting paradigm in healthcare where patient welfare is paramount.\nThis legislation not only aims to protect Arkansans but also serves as a compelling example for other states grappling with similar issues. The impacts of this law will reverberate throughout the healthcare system, enhancing the collaborative roles of pharmacists in integrated healthcare and potentially inspiring broader change across the nation.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat does HB 1150 entail?\nHB 1150 prohibits PBMs from owning pharmacies in Arkansas, aiming to enhance patient access to quality pharmacy care.\nWhy is this legislation important for pharmacy care?\nThe law aims to eliminate conflicts of interest arising from PBM ownership that negatively impacts prices and patient care.\nHow does this affect other states?\nArkansas's law could influence similar legislation in other states seeking to manage PBM practices and protect community pharmacies.\nWho supported the passage of HB 1150?\nThe APA and NCPA strongly advocated for this legislation, along with numerous community pharmacists and supportive legislators.\nWhat future changes can be expected in pharmacy regulations?\nWith the passage of HB 1150, other states may consider similar reforms, potentially leading to a nationwide shift in pharmacy practices and ownership regulations.\nAbout The Author\nContact Lucas Young privately here.

    "title": "Somos un pueblo grosero y salvaje",
    "text": "Somos un pueblo grosero y salvaje BarcelonaEl barón de Holbach (1723-1789) es un autor bastante leído actualmente, con retraso, porque revienta las religiones, la teología, Jesucristo, la intolerancia, la Iglesia católica, y muchas más cosas, cuando todo esto ya está casi resuelto , o situado donde toca. La editorial Laetoli –¡es el nombre de un yacimiento arqueológico de Tanzania!– ha publicado todos los libros irreverentes de este ilustrado, hombre de gran fortuna, y uno de los personajes mayores de los salones de las grandes damas parisinas del siglo ; pero en catalán todavía no tenemos ningún título. Hay un libro suyo que se encuentra en Abebooks.com en lengua hispánica (Madrid, 1812, y siguientes) que en francés se llamaba La morale universelle ou las devoirs del hombre fondés sur sa nature (Amsterdam, 1776), uno de los pocos del barón en el que no se mete ni con el Espíritu Santo ni con los clérigos, que todavía tiene vigencia. El volumen II de este libro lleva un capítulo titulado (traducimos): “De los deberes de los sabios, de la gente de letras y de los artistas”, en el que alaba a la gente que se dedica responsablemente a estas cosas, hombres y mujeres, y en dice elogios que hoy pueden parecernos prehistóricos: “En cualquier tiempo y en todos los países los talentos del espíritu y los hombres y mujeres que poseían han merecido el aprecio y la consideración de sus conciudadanos, y se les ha situado en un rango honorable y distinguido”. Si pensamos en nuestro país, y otros, parece claro que ahora ya no hay nadie que ostente ese sitio honorable –futbolistas aparte–, cuando, de hecho, nosotros tuvimos hasta no hace mucha gente muy notable, considerados “ autoridad”. Verdaguer, Català, Maragall, Carner, Riba –entre los letrados–; Urgell, Manolo, Casas, Mir y otros muchos –entre los artistas–; Pedro y Pons, Puigvert, Barraquer, Broggi y muchos más –entre los médicos–; Vicens Vives o Batllori entre los historiadores, y un grupo más, fueron considerados patriotas y hombres y mujeres venerados y respetables. Pero D'Holbach insinúa, en ese mismo capítulo, que en muchas culturas, de repente se instala un raro tipo de misticismo que eclipsa la gloria que los mejores hombres y mujeres de un país habían tenido tiempo atrás . Dice: “A veces hay pueblos groseros y salvajes que son guiados por el entusiasmo, sea porque se les ha querido engañar, sea porque se les ha considerado incapaces de ser conducidos por la razón. Por consiguiente, la ciencia de las costumbres y la política que escaqueaban a los sabios y antes a los eclesiásticos, ha sido sustituida por las fábulas”. Cataluña debe volver a rendir honor a la enorme serie de ciudadanos que hoy, como siempre en nuestra historia, despuntan en todos los campos de la ciencia, las letras y las artes. Están; pero ya no son respetados como merecerían, venerados menos.",
