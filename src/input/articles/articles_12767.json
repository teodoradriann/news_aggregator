    "text": "Sponsored Belong about 1 hour ago • 1 min What’s going on here? Boeing's West Coast factory workers voted 96% in favor of striking, putting a significant halt on the production of the company's top-selling jet during crucial times. What does this mean? Boeing's troubles seem to be far from over. The workers' decision to strike comes as Boeing strives to ramp up airplane production following a recent safety crisis. This disruption could lead to delays and financial setbacks for the aerospace giant, which has already been navigating turbulent skies. The strike threatens Boeing's ability to meet increasing demand for its leading jet models, potentially shaking investor confidence and disrupting supply chains. Why should I care? For markets: Navigating the turbulence. The strike could spell trouble for Boeing's [stock](/glossary/stock) price and investor sentiment. As production stalls, delivery schedules might suffer, impacting [revenue](/glossary/revenue) projections. Investors should brace for potential [volatility](/glossary/volatility) and monitor Boeing's negotiations closely, as prolonged strikes could exacerbate financial pressures and ripple through supplier networks. The bigger picture: Strategic setbacks at a critical juncture. Boeing's situation reflects broader challenges in the industrial sector, where labor disputes can severely disrupt operations. The aerospace industry is still recovering from past difficulties, and additional setbacks could hamper efforts towards stabilization and growth. On a macro scale, such industrial actions highlight the importance of robust labor relations and contingency planning in maintaining production continuity. Did you find this insightful?

    "title": "Musk Adds Microsoft to OpenAI Lawsuit, Accusing Them of an AI Monopoly - Business Insider",
    "text": "Advertisement Elon Musk has added Microsoft as a defendant in a lawsuit against OpenAI. The suit, which also adds Reid Hoffman as a defendant, accuses the companies of forming a monopoly. Musk claims OpenAI is trying to \"starve\" rivals of AI talent by offering \"lavish compensation.\" Elon Musk has amended a lawsuit against OpenAI to name Microsoft as a defendant, calling their partnership a \"de facto merger\" and accusing them of anticompetitive practices.\nThe revised lawsuit, filed Thursday, also names Reid Hoffman, a Microsoft board member and former OpenAI board member, as a defendant. And it names Musk's xAI startup and Shivon Zilis, the mother of three of his children, as plaintiffs. Zilis was previously an OpenAI board member and is now an executive at Neuralink, Musk's brain-implant company.\nAdvertisement The complaint accuses OpenAI and Microsoft of creating an artificial-intelligence monopoly and engaging in \"intensified\" anticompetitive practices, citing \"lavish compensation\" offers as one example.\nLawyers for Musk say in the amended complaint, filed at a federal court in Northern California: \"OpenAI has attempted to starve competitors of AI talent by aggressively recruiting employees with offers of lavish compensation, and is on track to spend $1.5 billion on personnel for just 1,500 employees.\"\nBloomberg previously reported that some OpenAI employees were making up to $800,000 a year, which can include bonuses and stock awards. It also said that most OpenAI engineering roles paid between $200,000 and $370,000, citing a review of job postings.\nAdvertisement Musk's lawyers say that the defendants \"possess a nearly 70% share of the generative AI market, constituting a monopoly, or, in the alternative, an attempt or conspiracy to monopolize the generative AI market.\"\nThe suit describes Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI as a \"de facto merger\" and says: \"Microsoft is now OpenAI, and OpenAI, Microsoft.\" It refers to a New York Times report from last month, which said Microsoft AI's chief, Mustafa Suleyman, was among a group of Microsoft employees who work from OpenAI's San Francisco office.\nThe amended lawsuit is the latest escalation between longtime rivals Musk and Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI. Musk first sued OpenAI and its cofounders Altman and Greg Brockman in March, accusing the company of jeopardizing its nonprofit mission by partnering with Microsoft, which has invested more than $13 billion into the startup. OpenAI responded to the suit by calling it \"incoherent\" and \"contradictory.\"\nAdvertisement Musk, who helped create OpenAI in 2015, then dropped his lawsuit without explanation. He filed the latest suit in August , arguing that OpenAI had abandoned its founding mission to develop AI that is beneficial for humanity because it's putting commercial interests first and claiming that he was \"deceived\" into cofounding the company. OpenAI said in September that it's moving to a for-profit governance structure .\nThe current lawsuit claims that OpenAI acted in an anticompetitive manner by asking investors in its most recent funding round not to invest in competitors, including Musk's xAI. The suit references an October report from the Financial Times, which said this was one of the terms asked of prospective investors for the $6.6 billion funding round that closed last month.\nAs part of that round, SoftBank committed $500 million to OpenAI. Navneet Govil, the chief financial officer of SoftBank's Vision Funds, previously told Business Insider that SoftBank still had the ability to invest in other AI companies. Govil told BI's Hasan Chowdhury: \"Our view is if it's a disruptive company and the addressable market is large, there's room for more than one player.\"\nMicrosoft, OpenAI, and Hoffman didn't immediately respond to requests for comment made outside normal working hours. In September, Hoffman called Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI a case of \"sour grapes.\"",

La decisión responde al número creciente de casos; así como la posibilidad de contagio en las zonas fuera de este territorio. Aunque, al momento no hay un diagnóstico crítico para el país, es importante tomar las prevenciones y mantenerse informado sobre la situación mediante los medios oficiales. En México, el primer aviso epidemiológico que se tuvo sobre la entonces [viruela del mono](https://lasillarota.com/nacion/2024/8/14/brote-de-mpox-viruela-del-mono-amenaza-nuevamente-mexico-497106.html) ocurrió en mayo de 2022. Justo el mundo atravesaba la pandemia por covid-19 cuando comenzaron a brotar los primeros casos de este otro virus. El primer caso confirmado en el país se dio el 28 de mayo del año 2022. Para diciembre del mismo año la Secretaría de Salud reportó 11 defunciones por viruela del mono y 3,455 casos confirmados. De acuerdo con las cifras, desde la confirmación del primer caso, en mayo 2022 al 6 de marzo de 2023, se tenía un registro de 3,928 contagios. Te podría interesar Viruela del mono en Hidalgo En el estado de Hidalgo se alertó sobre el primer caso de viruela del mono en septiembre de 2022. El entonces secretario de Salud de Hidalgo, Alejandro Efraín Benítez Herrera, señaló fue el 28 de agosto de 2022 cuando un paciente sin antecedentes de viaje acudió a recibir atención médica por presentar posible sintomatología de la enfermedad. Para el corte del 14 de noviembre de 2022, la Secretaría de Salud reportó 16 casos de viruela del mono, todos de tipo ambulatorio, es decir, sin necesidad de ser hospitalizada. Te podría interesar Para el año siguiente 2023, el Instituto de Diagnóstico y Referencia Epidemiológicos (InDRE) notificó que los casos de viruela del mono se distribuían en los 32 estados con mayor incidencia en estos 15: - Ciudad de México, 2,029 contagios - Jalisco, 402; - Estado de México, 361; - Quintana Roo, 238; - Yucatán, 169; - Nuevo León,125; - Puebla, 68; - Veracruz, 64; - Tabasco, 57; - Chiapas, 52; - Baja California, 32; - Tamaulipas, 31; - Querétaro, 30; - Hidalgo, 26; - Morelos, 25 ¿De dónde viene la viruela del mono? La mpox, antes viruela del mono es una zoonosis viral; es decir, una enfermedad transmitida al ser humano por contagio directo con un animal enfermo. Es una enfermedad infecciosa, causada por un virus miembro del género Orthopoxvirus, de la familia Poxviridae, semejante al de la viruela humana. Se le atribuye ese nombre porque la enfermedad se detectó por primera vez en colonias de monos criados para investigación en 1958. ¿Cuáles son los síntomas? Uno de los síntomas más visibles en la viruela del mono son las erupciones cutáneas o lesiones mucosas en la cara, las manos, los pies, el pecho, la boca o cerca de los genitales o el ano, que pueden durar de 2 a 4 semanas, acompañadas de otros síntomas como: - Fiebre (38 grados Celsius) - Dolor de cabeza - Agotamiento - Dolores musculares - Inflamación de los ganglios linfáticos (están en el cuello, axilas, pecho, abdomen e ingles) - Agotamiento ¿Cómo se transmite? La viruela símica puede transmitirse a los seres humanos por contacto físico con personas infectadas, es decir, con sus lesiones, flujos corporales, gotitas respiratorias. También por contacto con objetos contaminados de una persona contagiada (ropa, ropa de cama, toallas, etc.). O al tener contacto con animales infectados, ratas, ratones, hamsters, ardillas. ¿Cuál es el panorama actual en México? Actualmente la declaratoria de emergencia sanitaria es en la República Democrática del Congo donde registran más de 14,000 y al menos 524 muertes, de acuerdo con datos de la OMS en lo que va de este 2024. En México, a la fecha no se han reportado nuevos casos de mpox, por lo que se mantienen las medidas preventivas y el contacto con las autoridades de salud para actuar en caso de ser necesario. jgp",

Hurricane Milton made landfall around 8:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 9, near Siesta Key, Florida, as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 120 mph, causing storm surge, flooding, and wind damage. It then trekked across Central Florida where portions of Orange, Seminole, and Volusia counties, as well as others, saw flooded roads and homes, trees down, and power outages. Before Milton made landfall, more than 120 tornado warnings were issued across Florida, the record for the most tornado warnings issued in the state within 24 hours, according to the National Weather Service. The NWS is now surveying those areas hit hardest to determine those tornadoes&apos; strengths and sizes. Warnings are issued when there is a radar-indicated tornado or when a spotter sees a funnel cloud or tornado on the ground.",

    "text": "Everyone is hopping in on the March Madness bracket-making fun, and by everyone, I mean everyone . Celebrity brackets have been a hot commodity the last several years, and that’s no different this time around. The latest to hop on the trend was hip-hop star Flavor Flav. The Grammy Award winner and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee has a very favorable bracket for Kentucky, even going as far as to pick the Cats to make their first-ever Final Four appearance. In his bracket, he has Kentucky, North Carolina, Michigan and LSU in Tampa, with Kentucky falling to the eventual champion Tigers. On Kentucky’s path to Tampa, Flavor Flav has the Cats beating 13-seed Liberty, 5-seed Kansas State, 1-seed USC and 3-seed Oklahoma. If you’re a betting man, Kentucky should probably win those first two games, and they’ve already beaten the Sooners this season. That Sweet 16 matchup against the Trojans is the trickiest one, especially with that game being out in Spokane where it could almost even be a home game for them. In a one-game scenario though, why not Kentucky, right? Kentucky getting to a Final Four for the first time ever in just one year under Kenny Brooks would be pretty sweet. As Flavor Flav would say… yeah, boy ! The post Flavor Flav picks Kentucky WBB to make its first-ever Final Four appeared first on On3 .",

    "text": "Desarrollan un rayo tractor en miniatura para la manipulación de partículas biológicas Investigadores del Instituto Tecnológico de Massachusetts (MIT) han logrado un avance revolucionario en el campo de la biotecnología al crear un rayo tractor en miniatura diseñado para manipular partículas biológicas. Este innovador dispositivo tiene el potencial de transformar el estudio del ADN, la clasificación de células y la investigación de enfermedades, proporcionando una herramienta más eficiente y accesible para la manipulación biológica. El dispositivo, que es lo suficientemente pequeño como para caber en la palma de una mano, utiliza un haz de luz emitido por un chip fotónico de silicio para mover y manipular partículas biológicas a una distancia de varios milímetros de la superficie del chip. Este rayo tractor en miniatura tiene la capacidad de penetrar a través de cubreobjetos de vidrio, lo que permite mantener las muestras biológicas en un entorno estéril, un factor crucial para los experimentos científicos. A diferencia de las pinzas ópticas convencionales, que requieren equipos voluminosos como microscopios, este dispositivo basado en chip ofrece una alternativa más compacta y de alto rendimiento. Las pinzas ópticas tradicionales utilizan luz para atrapar y manipular partículas, pero su tamaño y configuración limitan su accesibilidad. Este nuevo avance permite una manipulación precisa de células y otras partículas biológicas en un formato mucho más pequeño y fácil de fabricar en masa. Hasta ahora, las pinzas ópticas basadas en chips presentaban una limitación significativa: solo podían manipular partículas que estaban en contacto cercano con la superficie del chip, lo que presentaba problemas como la contaminación del dispositivo y el estrés en las células manipuladas. Sin embargo, los científicos del MIT han logrado superar esta barrera utilizando una tecnología llamada matriz óptica en fase integrada, que permite manipular células a más de cien veces la distancia previamente posible, manteniendo intacta la calidad de las muestras biológicas. La profesora Jelena Notaros, una de las principales investigadoras del proyecto y miembro del Laboratorio de Investigación de Electrónica del MIT, expresó su entusiasmo por las posibilidades que este avance abre para la biotecnología. Según Notaros, la capacidad de atrapar y manipular células a mayores distancias representa una innovación en las pinzas ópticas basadas en chips. Este desarrollo promete mejorar los experimentos biológicos estándar al permitir una manipulación más precisa y sin comprometer la integridad de las muestras. \"Este trabajo abre nuevas posibilidades para las pinzas ópticas basadas en chips al permitir atrapar y pinzar células a distancias mucho mayores que las demostradas anteriormente. Es emocionante pensar en las diferentes aplicaciones que podría permitir esta tecnología\", destacó Notaros. Este avance tiene el potencial de ser ampliamente utilizado en una variedad de aplicaciones científicas y médicas. Desde la clasificación y manipulación de células individuales hasta el análisis detallado del ADN y la investigación de enfermedades, este rayo tractor en miniatura podría ser clave para acelerar el desarrollo de tratamientos médicos y diagnósticos más avanzados. Además, su diseño compacto y eficiente podría hacer que esta tecnología sea accesible para una gama más amplia de laboratorios en todo el mundo. Los detalles completos de esta investigación pionera han sido publicados en la revista [Nature Communications. ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52273-x)La publicación destaca cómo este dispositivo no solo representa un avance en la tecnología de manipulación óptica, sino que también puede marcar un punto de inflexión en la forma en que los científicos abordan experimentos biológicos complejos. Este rayo tractor en miniatura del MIT podría ser el precursor de una nueva generación de herramientas de manipulación biológica, permitiendo a los científicos trabajar con una mayor precisión y eficiencia. Con su capacidad para realizar tareas que antes requerían equipos más grandes y complicados, este dispositivo promete hacer que la investigación biológica sea más rápida, precisa y accesible. @mundiario",
