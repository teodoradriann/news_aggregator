Averaging 9.5 points per game, he has showcased his scoring ability, including impressive performances that rank him among the top rookie scorers.\n- Knecht averages 9.5 points, 3.0 rebounds, and 0.9 assists with a shooting percentage of 46.4%.\n- He scored a career-high 37 points with nine three-pointers against the Utah Jazz.\n- Knecht has scored in double digits in seven of his last nine games, averaging 14.3 points during this period.\n- The Lakers are relying on Knecht's offensive capabilities as they navigate injuries to key players like LeBron James and Rui Hachimura.\nAs the playoffs approach, Knecht's role is expected to expand further, substantiating his value as both a scorer and a team player.

    "text": "Microsoft has started showing full-screen ads to Windows 10 users to promote Windows 11 and Copilot+.\nHere’s what we know These ads highlight new features and warn that support for Windows 10 will end in October 2025. Users are encouraged to upgrade to Windows 11 or purchase security updates to protect their computers. Microsoft says the new Copilot+ computers are significantly faster than older Windows PCs, making them an attractive upgrade option.\nCurrently, around 70% of Windows users are still using Windows 10, so the company is doubling its efforts to get them to upgrade to Windows 11 before support expires. If users decide to stay on Windows 10 after October 2025, they will have to pay for advanced security updates. Businesses will pay $61 per computer the first year, and that amount will double each subsequent year. Microsoft has not yet announced the cost for individuals, but promises to provide this information later.\nSource : Windows Latest\nHere are two PAA-related questions⁢ based on⁢ the provided podcast synopsis: ## Upgrading to Windows 11: A Necessary Step or Aggressive Marketing?\n**Host:** Welcome to World Today News!

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",
