    "text": "Wilmington, NC based Bryter Restoration of Wilmington is reaching out to local homeowners to share some tips that can help them prepare for the winter months. The locally owned business is dedicated to providing the community high quality services. This includes 24-hour availability for quality water damage restoration services in Wilmington and all surrounding areas of New Hanover, Brunswick and Pender Counties.\nBryter Restoration says, “Winter and the holiday season that comes along with it can be very beautiful, but like everything else in life, there are things you are going to have to look out for during winter months. For homeowners, a key concern is going to be preventing unexpected damage to their home from a burst water pipe or a leaky roof. Should something go wrong during the holiday season, it's going to put a damper on the mood and ruin what should otherwise be a fun time. The good thing is that there are preventative measures any homeowner can take.”\nBefore considering any specific actions, the company says maintaining an adequate temperature inside the home can go a long way in preventing unnecessary damage. Bryter Restoration recommends keeping the temperature in the house above freezing, especially in areas where pipes are located. This can be done by maintaining a constant indoor temperature or using additional heating devices (like space heaters).\nIn fact, burst pipes are one of the biggest risks homes face during the winter season. As the temperature drops, the risk of burst water pipes increases. When water freezes, it expands, putting pressure on pipes and potentially causing them to burst. A burst water pipe can lead to flooding, water damage and a completely unnecessary headache.\nHomeowners looking to prevent this should take care to insulate critical areas, as this provides protection against the freezing and expansion of water within the pipes. Bryter Restoration of Wilmington shares that homeowners should pay extra attention to colder rooms and areas such as the attic, basement and so on. They should do the same for certain outdoor spaces, such as garages.\nThe company recommends the use of polyethylene pipe lagging material, a flexible foam specifically designed for water pipe insulation. This insulation should be slid onto the pipes, covering them completely, with no gaps left at bends, fittings or valves.\nThe company also shares that homeowners should disconnect and drain outdoor hoses — and shut off the water supply to outdoor taps. This prevents water from freezing and expanding within the pipes, reducing the risk of bursts. However, even with careful preparation, the worst can still happen. Should there be an unpreventable burst water pipe, homeowners should immediately turn off the water supply at the main stopcock, shut off the central heating and then open taps to drain the system.\nHomeowners will also want to possibly get their roofs inspected, which can be a critically important step when preparing a house for winter. Winter storms, including heavy rain and especially hail, can end up wreaking havoc on a roof, so it is important that they take the initiative to repair any damage before their roof is exposed to the worst of winter weather. Homeowners who cannot access their roof can and should have it inspected by a contractor. Contractors will also be able to take care of any minor repairs that are needed. While this might be an unexpected expense, it will be far more affordable than dealing with any damages caused by a leaky roof over the winter.\nBryter Restoration was formed after many years of water damage restoration work in the Carolinas . The members of the team have undertaken numerous projects following storms and hurricanes over the last 15 years, and they boast decades of combined experience serving the families of Wilmington and the Carolinas. In addition to providing their services to the city of Wilmington, Bryter Restoration of Wilmington’s service areas also include the surrounding cities, such as Wrightsville Beach, Myrtle Beach, Moorehead City, Carolina Beach and more.\nAnyone looking for water damage cleanup services in Wilmington or who simply wants to learn more about the services provided by Bryter Restoration of Wilmington should visit the company’s website to get started. The company encourages interested parties to directly get in touch via email or phone.

    "text": "{p}On Jan. 1, 2024, the sale of flavored tobacco will be prohibited in the city of Columbus.{/p}{p}Last year, Columbus City Council voted to approve a city-wide ban on the sale of flavored and menthol tobacco products.{ }{/p}{p}City leaders have said they're trying to combat a 'public health crisis\\\" among the black community and teenagers.{/p}{p}\\\"We know that flavored tobacco specifically targets youth and people of color,\\\" Luke Jacobs, the Public Health Administrator for Environmental Health with Columbus Public Health, said. \\\"This is trying to right those in-corrections that have disproportionally impacted our community.\\\"{/p}{p}{sd-embed class=\\\"sd-embedded-media\\\" data-embed-file=\\\"1740388359221162436\\\" data-embed-type=\\\"twitter\\\" contenteditable=\\\"false\\\"}{/sd-embed}{/p}{p}But as the new year approaches, Columbus businesses expressed concerns about the impact the ban would have on them.{/p}{p}\\\"We’re going to be looking at a pay cut for everyone in the company,\\\"{ }Emma Mynatt, a manager at Waterbeds 'n' Stuff, said. \\\"We probably make about $200-$300 a day per location from those flavored products. By losing them, our personal income will decrease, and it might result in a lot of people losing their jobs as well if we aren’t able to pay all of our employees.\\\"{/p}{p}Waterbeds 'n' Stuff has 13 locations in Ohio, three of them within Columbus City limits.{ }{br}{/p}{p}Mynatt said her biggest concern is that the flavored tobacco ban doesn't impact other cities neighboring Columbus.{/p}{p}\\\"They'll just go to other stores,\\\" Mynatt said. \\\"If they want to buy a nicotine product and they need other items too, they will most likely go to a different location and buy those items at one place, which would decrease our profit here.\\\"{/p}{p}{sd-embed class=\\\"sd-embedded-media\\\"

    "text": "hier.\nDas ist kaum zu fassen\nSwitch 2: Wie bitte? Das kann nicht ernst gemeint sein - Nintendo-Fans sind entsetzt von \"Erfindung\"\n14.08.2025, 09:07 Uhr Was zur Hölle ist das denn bitte? Über die Switch 2 wurde ja schon viel diskutiert. Sei es wegen der hohen Preise, unverständlicher Nintendo-Entscheidungen oder der Spielflaute nach Mario Kart World und Donkey Kong Bananza. Jetzt kommt aber echt die Krönung - das kann doch nicht ernst gemeint sein. Oder?\nDie Switch 2 raubt Nintendo-Fans den Atem\nErneut sind Nintendo-Fans fassungslos. Schon vor einigen Tagen sorgte die Ankündigung einer neuen Switch 2 inklusive erster Bilder für Staunen. Und dann kam es nur kurz darauf noch besser. Schon in weniger als zwei Monaten erscheint eine neue Nintendo-\"Konsole\" - aber es ist keine Switch 2. Nun sind Nintendo-Fans erneut entsetzt und man kann es ihnen wirklich nicht verübeln. Was ist jetzt passiert?\nNeue Erfindung für Switch 2 ist kaum zu fassen\nEins nach dem anderen. Die Switch 2 ist wie schon die Switch 1 dank der abnehmbaren Joy-Con-Controller besonders vielseitig nutzbar. Bei der neuen Switch verbaut Nintendo Magnete in den Controllern statt simplen Schienen aus Metall wie bei der alten Switch. Ein echter Fortschritt in Sachen Nutzbarkeit. Und offenbar auch eine willkommene Einladung für völlig verrückte Ideen.\nZu diesem Schluss muss man kommen, wenn man sich die neueste Erfindung für die Switch 2 anschaut.\nSwitch-2-News direkt aufs Smartphone\nWer keine Neuigkeiten zur Switch 2 verpassen will, sollte unserem WhatsApp-Kanal zur neuen Nintendo-Konsole folgen. Einfach auf den Link klicken und kostenlos abonnieren.\nSwitch-2-Erfindung: Das kann doch nicht ernst gemeint sein\nWas stört beim Switch-2-Spielen am meisten? Die kurze Akkulaufzeit? Zu hohes Gewicht? Lange Ladezeiten? Ein gewiefter Nintendo-Fan wurde offenbar von einem völlig anderen Problem geplagt und hat sich eine völlig absurde Lösung ausgedacht.\nEin kurzes Video zeigt seine Erfindung für die Switch 2 namens \"GamiFries\". Was ist das denn? Dabei handelt es sich um einen roten Behälter für ... Pommes. Echt jetzt? Ja. Die Besonderheit: Die Pommes-Halterung kann man zwischen zwei Joy-Con-Controller der Switch 2 stecken. Oder, wem das noch nicht bekloppt genug ist: zwischen das Mittelteil der Switch 2 mit dem Bildschirm und einen Joy-Con-Controller. Wie die \"geniale\" Erfindung in Aktion aussieht, sieht man in dem Video. In den Kommentaren halten Nintendo-Fans ihre Meinung nicht zurück. Wie gut (oder schlecht) kommt das Switch-2-Gadget an?\n- Nintendo Switch 2 + Pokémon-Legenden Z-A\n:509,99 Euro bei Amazon.de - Nintendo Switch 2 + Pokémon-Legenden Z-A:\n509,99 Euro bei MediaMarkt.de\nDas sagen Nintendo-Fans zu der absurden Switch-2-Erfindung\nIn den Kommentaren unter dem Video feiern viele Fans die völlig verrückte Idee zwar. Doch so richtig Bock hat wohl kaum einer, das absurde Gadget für die Switch 2 wirklich zu nutzen. Viele sind entsetzt von der Idee, beim Zocken fettige Pommes zu essen und danach mit ölverschmierten Joy-Cons spielen zu müssen. Ob Nintendo bei der ganzen Nummer nur ruhig zuschaut und die Füße stillhält oder lässt die Mario-Firma die berühmt-berüchtigten Anwälte von der Leine und kassiert die Erfindung ein? Das kann nur die Zukunft zeigen.",

    "text": "More than 55,000 Canada Post workers have been on strike for two weeks and now some are temporarily losing their jobs.\nOn Monday, the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) said in a bulletin to members that Canada Post has temporarily laid off postal employees as the strike approaches its third week and into Black Friday weekend- one of the busiest online shopping events of the year.\nThe union is calling the layoffs a “scare tactic” as the two parties fail to come to an agreement.\nRead More\nBargaining talks between Canada Post and CUPW are suspended, strike continues On Wednesday, striking workers organized a rally at the mail facility in Scarborough, Ont.\n“Canada Post management talks about the urgency of reaching a deal while they still sit in their offices or at home collecting their six figure salaries and bonuses,” the CUPW wrote in a statement on Nov. 27.\nCanada Post spokesperson Lisa Lui said that the Crown corporation has had to make adjustments to their operations during the national labour disruption, in a statement to CBC News.\nWhile the Canada Labour Code states that employers are forbidden from laying off striking workers, Lui says that the collective agreements are no longer in effect and the employment conditions of Canada Post workers have now changed as a result of the strike.\nOn Monday, Canada Post said it was down nearly 11 million parcels since the strike began.\n“The impacts continue to be felt across the country, hitting small businesses, charities and remote communities the most,” Liu said in a statement.\nAs the strike continues to delay mail deliveries ahead of the holidays, Canadians express where they stand online.\n“While I am annoyed that I can’t send mail right now, let me be very clear, I do not for one second blame Canada Post workers or their union. This is on @canadapostcorp for trying to be shady, greedy, exploitative, unethical & unfair,” one person wrote on X.\nAnother said, “Everyone saying we don’t need Canada Post obviously doesn’t live in a rural area that couriers don’t come to.”\nWhile one person on X added some light to the situation: “If this Canada Post strike ends my 36 year streak of getting a letter response from Santa, I’m going to absolutely snap.”\nEarlier this week, bargaining talks between the union and corporation were suspended as no productive agreements were being made.",
