    "title": "El fuerte descargo de Juez contra el Gobierno por los incendios en Córdoba - LA NACION",
    "text": "Luego de que el senador de La Libertad Avanza (LLA) Ezequiel Atauche indicara que el bloque oficialista se iba a abstener en el voto porque “el proyecto no contempla partidas asignadas” , el legislador de Frente Pro Luis Juez apuntó este jueves contra el gobierno de Javier Milei en medio del debate por el proyecto de ley que declara la emergencia ambiental, económica y habitacional por 180 días en la provincia de Córdoba tras los incendios que azotan la provincia gobernada por Martín Llaryora . Aunque dijo estar de acuerdo con la lucha contra el fuego, la declaración de Atauche causó sorpresa en la Cámara alta, ya que, hasta ese entonces, se creía que la iniciativa presentada por Juez y apoyada por los otros dos senadores de Córdoba, Carmen Alvarez Rivero (Pro) y Alejandra Vigo (Unidad Federal), sería aprobada por unanimidad .\nInmediatamente después de los dichos del libertario, Vigo afirmó: “Si hay un tema que no podemos politizar es este” . En ese marco, planteó que “hubiera sido interesante que la bancada oficialista se hubiera excusado antes” , en alusión a que el anuncio se hizo sobre el cierre del tratamiento. Guadalupe Tagliaferri (Pro-Capital) se sumó a las críticas contra el bloque libertario: “Lamento la doble vara del oficialismo. Acabamos de aprobar un proyecto que no tiene asignación presupuestaria alguna”, subrayó la senadora, en referencia a la ley que amplía el uso del Registro Nacional de Datos Genéticos para la investigación de todos los delitos penales.\nY añadió: “Por eso le recomendaría al jefe de la bancada oficialista, que busque otro argumento y que digan que para aquellos proyectos que no le interesan, la excusa va a ser que no tiene asignación presupuestaria” .",

    "text": "Crustless Nut Free Sandwiches for On-the-Go StudentsCrustless Nut Free Sandwiches for On-the-Go Students\nApril 23, 2025\nSponsored by SunButter\nCampus dining establishments have to meet students where they are, which could be anywhere. Portable, on-the-go meals and snacks are more in demand now than ever, as busy students seek delicious foods that they can toss into their backpacks and eat at their convenience. If the food brings on a certain nostalgia, all the better.\nThe challenge for college and university foodservice is that some legacy favorites need to be updated to accommodate the growing number of students with food allergies. According to Food Allergy Resource & Education (FARE), approximately 33 million people in the U.S. have food allergies, including 27 million adults over 18. Nine major food allergens—milk, egg, peanut, tree nuts, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish, and sesame—are responsible for at least 90 percent of the serious food allergy reactions in the U.S., according to FARE, which cited the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and others.\nWhile there is evidence that children outgrow allergies to milk, egg, wheat, and soy, allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, and shellfish are generally lifelong. So while the quintessential peanut butter and jelly sandwich is the perfect snack and meal for many students, there is a growing segment of students who cannot eat one, and will probably not sit next to their friends enjoying a PB&J.\nAs these young adults attend college, they expect a safe, inclusive environment, especially at meal and snack occasions. College and university foodservice establishments have made offering a variety of allergy-friendly foods a top priority, according to the National Association of College & University Food Services (NACUFS) report, “Campus Dining: 2030 and Beyond.” Flexibility and the ability to adapt to a changing student population are important components of success for C&U foodservice. As students become more vocal about their dietary needs, operators are updating their menus to ensure safety and inclusivity.\nOne solution is SunButter Jammies™ Sunflower Butter and Jelly Sandwiches. A nutrient-rich alternative to peanut butter, sunflower butter has a rich nutty taste without the nuts and is packed with plant-based protein. Students can fuel up and go nut-free with Sunflower Seed Butter and Grape or Strawberry Jelly sandwiches in the convenient crustless format that they loved as kids and still crave.\nFor the current generation of students seeking better-for-you foods that also taste good, SunButter Jammies™ are a delicious clean label option with no artificial flavors, sweeteners, preservatives, GMOs, or high-fructose corn syrup.\nSunButter Jammies™ are ready to go wherever students want to enjoy them. Individually wrapped in a thaw and eat format, they’re perfect for grab and go, vending, campus stores, catering, athletic events, and snacking anywhere.\nFor more information on SunButter Jammies™ Sunflower Butter and Jelly sandwiches, visit here.\nYou May Also Like",

    "title": "Getinge ending production of cardiopulmonary surgical perfusion systems",
    "text": "Getinge ending production of cardiopulmonary surgical perfusion systems\nSwedish company Getinge says it is moving ahead with plans to phase out its cardiopulmonary surgical perfusion product portfolio by the end of 2025. This will free up money for expanded investment in its extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) offerings, although they are currently facing quality control issues.\nThe company plans to end production of its HL 40 Heart-Lung Machine and HCU 40 HCU 40 heater-cooler unit and related disposable products.\nOne of the main reasons for ending production is the fact that these products were not included in the lucrative U.S. market since 2015, when Getinge signed a consent decree with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to temporarily suspend production of of the devices at its manufacturing site in New Hampshire because of quality production management issues. However, devices never returned to the U.S. market and the same unresolved consent decree are still causing issues with regulatory bodies.\nGetinge said it is abandoning the market because of a continual decline in market share since the end of its U.S. sales. In 2018, the company said it had about 15% of this market and in 2023 this had declined to about 7%. Also, with more cardiac surgeries now being interventional, the company said prospects for future market growth is limited.\n\"We are proud of our legacy and the products we have, but unfortunately we have been challenged gradually over the past 10 years with a steadily decreasing market share and eroding margins,\" explained Getinge CEO Mathias Perjos during the company's Q4 2024 earnings report, presented Jan. 28.\nIssues with the company's production quality are not limited to the U.S. On March 1, 2024, TÜV SÜD, the European Union's body for certification services, temporarily suspended Getinge's CE mark certificate for the Cardiosave and required the company to take corrective actions.\nThe exit of Getinge from the cardiopulmonary bypass equipment (CBPE) sector will likely benefit dominant players such as LivaNova, which already had about 50.3% of the market share as of 2024, according to GlobalData, a data and analytics company. But GlobalData said Getinge only accounted for about 1.9% of the market share.\nDespite FDA action sales have not slowed for ECMO or IABP\nWhile Getinge said it plans top put more investment into its IABP and ECMO systems that do continue to do well in the market, these products are facing quality control issues with regulatory agencies.\nThe FDA worked with the U.S. Department of Justice to place Getinge manufacturing sites under consent decree in 2015 and added the IABP manufacturing site in 2022. These actions allow additional FDA oversight, an independent auditor, inspections, and updates on progress made toward addressing quality and safety concerns. As of May 2024, the FDA said the cardiopulmonary bypass and IABP facilities have not met the requirements to have the consent decree lifted.\nThe FDA sent a letter to providers on May 9, 2024, instructing them to transition from using the Getinge Cardiosave IABP and Cardiohelp ECMO systems to other vendors, unless they could not find an alternative. The FDA move was because of the ongoing quality-related deficiencies in Getinge's manufacturing.\nAt the time the letter was sent, Getinge said it had over 60% of the U.S. market share for these types of products. So despite the letter, Perjos said there was no impact on its sales in 2024. He said U.S. sales of these products made up about 7% of total Getinge revenues prior to the FDA letter and it was still at 7% at the end of 2024.\nPerjos said disposables make up the bulk of the revenue for this market segment, so the vendor did not see a transition by hospitals to other competitor systems, which Getinge said was a little surprising.\n\"This has proved that the products are in demand and that we have high customer loyalty,\" Perjos said during the earnings call.\nAfter the letter was released, Getinge stopped all promotional activities for Cardiohelp and Cardiosave in the U.S. until its quality improvements have been addressed and approved by the FDA. The company said it is making progress related to the FDA field actions for the Cardiosave IABP system. The company said the cost to fix the issues will be about $279 million, with work that will extend into 2026 and 2027.\nPerjos also said Getinge has next-generation versions of the Cardiosave and Cardiohelp systems in the pipeline, so it is committed to continuing these product lines.\nFDA compliance issues have been ongoing\nThe issues identified in 2015 had not been resolved by 2019, which led the FDA to sent a warning letter to Getinge. Inspections of its facilities between November 2021 and January 2022 found they were still not in compliance.\nThe company said its costs for the IABP improvement activities from 2018 to 2022 amounted to about $470 million.\nGetinge planning to invest more in transplant and ECMO\nPerjos said this will allow resources to be reallocation to more financially attractive areas, including extracorporeal life support (ECLS), or better known in the U.S. as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The company is also putting more resources into transplant care.\nAs part of this move, Getinge acquired Paragonix Technologies Inc. in 2024, which saw impressive growth in the past quarter. Its KidneyVault portable renal perfusion system addresses the largest organ transplant market in terms of volume, and received FDA 510(k) clearance. The Paragonix product portfolio now encompasses all major organ categories, which includes about 50% off the market share for heart transplant.\nIncreasing competition in the U.S. ECMO market\nGetinge has seen increased competition in the U.S. market that Perjos confirmed is making some headway. He said this confirms ECMO is an area of growth in the U.S. market\nFor example, Medtronic launched its Vitalflow ECMO system in September 2024.",

    "text": "The Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) , trade union affiliated to Communist Party of India (Marxist), has demanded that Urban Company should ensure minimum wages for domestic workers it’s offering to clients to avoid their exploitation.\nThe new service for domestic “maids” offered by the Urban Company which “promises” to make available domestic services within 15 minutes for ₹49 per hour is yet another example of the continuing exploitation and dehumanisation of paid domestic workers in our country, the CITU said in a statement.\nExpressing apprehension, the trade union said that it is well known that such platforms charge a commission to the workers, which successively increases over time, leading to severe exploitation of such ‘gig’ workers.\n“It is therefore unlikely that workers will get even the amount that has been advertised as the cost to the customer, which in any case is far below the minimum wages of at least ₹100 per hour that CITU has been demanding for some time now,” the CITU stated.\nAlso read CITU urges Tamil Nadu Govt to intervene in Samsung Chennai strike\nTrade unions to meet on Tuesday over move to implement pro-employer labour codes\nRelated Stories Trade unions to meet on Tuesday over move to implement pro-employer labour codes Trade Unions are oUnion Ministry of Labour and Employment sources had earlier said that all the states and Union Territories are expected to complete harmonised draft rules under four labour codes for its implementation READ NOW The issue of safety at the customers’ homes is critical especially when several other women providing beauty and other services by such platforms have complained of sexual harassment, the trade union statement read.\nIt should be noted that these companies continue to flout the law of the land and refuse to implement the POSH Act by falsely claiming to be ‘aggregators’ and not employers, it charged.\n“We strongly condemn the pejorative term “maid” that has been used by the Urban Company. It shows its arrogance and wilful ignorance of the long–drawn struggles, both national and international, of domestic workers, against stigmatisation and for their dignity and status as workers,” CITU insisted.\nThe trade union stated that it is ironical that the service has been launched just when the Supreme Court has recently, suo moto commented on the vulnerability of domestic workers and the non-regulation of this crucial sector that employs lakhs of workers, primarily women.\nWe call upon the Government of India to take heed of this order and take steps to enact a comprehensive law that will regulate the working conditions of domestic workers and accord them their legitimate rights as workers, it observed.",

Más de 100 estudiantes bilingües comenzarán sus clases en la preparatoria Malcolm X Shabazz High School en este otoño, una cantidad mayor de matrícula a la que era esperada.\nDesde que comenzó la pandemia de COVID-19 en 2020, la cantidad de estudiantes de inglés en el distrito ha crecido, siendo una tendencia similar a la de las escuelas de todo el país. Este año, 11,072 estudiantes de inglés se han matriculado en las escuelas públicas de Newark, 822 más que el año pasado.\nSe calcula que más de 39,000 estudiantes regresaron a las aulas de clase en Newark el 3 de septiembre.\nA medida que crece el número de estudiantes de inglés en el distrito, los funcionarios escolares luchan contra la escasez de maestros bilingües que puedan comunicarse en diferentes idiomas. Los directivos del distrito escolar informan que están trabajando para cubrir puestos difíciles de encontrar, como los de profesores bilingües y de educación especial en todas las escuelas.\nLos alumnos de inglés del distrito incluyen una mezcla de estudiantes nacidos en el país y en el extranjero. La mayoría habla español o portugués, aunque algunos hablan árabe, francés, creole haitiano u otros idiomas. Para el año 2025, 1 de cada 4 niños en las aulas de todo el país aprenderá inglés, según la Asociación Nacional de Educación .\nEl año pasado, 10,250 estudiantes de inglés se matricularon en el distrito, según los datos del otoño de 2023-24 . Desde el año escolar 2020-21, los estudiantes de inglés en el distrito han crecido un 7%, del 17.1% al 24.2% el año pasado, según el informe de desempeño escolar de 2023-24 de Nueva Jersey. Los líderes de distrito han asignado $4.2 millones adicionales en el presupuesto del presente año escolar para apoyar la expansión de programas bilingües en todas las escuelas.\nEn Shabazz, el programa bilingüe ofrecerá a los estudiantes en los grados 9 y 10 que aprenden inglés la opción de recibir los servicios más cerca de casa en este otoño. El distrito planeó inscribir a 48 estudiantes en los grados noveno y décimo en el programa bilingüe, pero ha inscrito a 92 alumnos de grado 9 y 35 del grado 10 hasta el 20 de agosto, según dijo el Superintendente Roger León el martes. Cuatro maestros impartirán educación bilingüe en la preparatoria, según Paul Brubaker, director de la oficina de comunicaciones del distrito.\n“Sabemos que en este momento hay un exceso de alumnos matriculados, el número real de estudiantes bilingües que estábamos planeando, dado el estatus de los estudiantes bilingües en todo el distrito, es más alto”, afirmó León sobre el programa bilingüe en Shabazz durante la reunión de la junta escolar el martes.\nLos miembros de la junta escolar también han expresado su preocupación por la integración de nuevos estudiantes y culturas en Shabazz.\nDurante la reunión del martes, la integrante de la junta escolar, Dawn Haynes, preguntó si hubo un plan para integrar a los nuevos estudiantes en Shabazz y asegurar que todos los alumnos tengan acceso a los recursos, tanto para los nuevos como para los que retornan. Específicamente, Haynes preguntó cómo se incorporarían las recomendaciones del informe Creed Strategies, una revisión de la dinámica cultural en los Estudios Globales de Newark que también incluía recomendaciones para evaluar los efectos de la anti negritud en las escuelas .\nLeón dijo que la directora de educación bilingüe del distrito, Marisol Díaz, está liderando ese trabajo y se ha reunido con los directores y el equipo administrativo de Shabazz para “discutir diferencias culturales muy importantes” mientras se preparan para los estudiantes el próximo mes. Las expectativas para todos los estudiantes se fijarán durante la orientación de los estudiantes la próxima semana, agregó León.\nLeón también mencionó el martes que el distrito recibió solicitudes de transferencia de estudiantes de los grados 11 y 12 en programas bilingües en las escuelas de preparatoria Barringer y East Side “para que puedan estar más cerca de casa”.\n“Tenemos estudiantes que tienen que tomar múltiples autobuses para llegar a la escuela y ahora los estudiantes bilingües del área South Ward ya no tienen que hacer eso”, dijo León durante la reunión del martes.\nEn el área North Ward de Newark, 14 escuelas primarias y dos secundarias ofrecen programas de educación bilingüe en el distrito, los más altos de cualquier vecindario, según datos del distrito. El año escolar pasado, cinco escuelas primarias en el South Ward ofrecieron programas bilingües.\nEl año escolar pasado, las escuelas de secundaria Eastside y Barringer vieron la mayor matrícula de estudiantes bilingües en sus escuelas, con “el mayor número de vacantes bilingües y ESL” entre los maestros de Barringer, según explicó Vereliz Santana, integrante de la junta, durante la reunión de la junta escolar en enero . Durante esa reunión, Vereliz también dijo que el nuevo programa en Shabazz aliviaría algunas de las presiones de personal en Barringer y East Side, ambas escuelas en el North Ward.\nEn los grados de primaria, estudiantes bilingües como Angie, una alumna del tercer grado que habla español y está en ascenso en la escuela Dr. William H. Horton del North Ward, dijo que le gusta el aprendizaje en dos idiomas. Explicó que su maestra del año pasado, a quien llamó Sra. F. porque no podía pronunciar su nombre, se comunicaba con ella usando una aplicación de traductor en su teléfono.\n“Ella le hablaba al teléfono y luego el teléfono decía cosas en español”, dijo Angie en español durante el evento de regreso a la escuela del distrito en la escuela Hawkins Street Elementary School.\nImelda García, madre de Angie, dijo que su hija está aprendiendo inglés rápidamente y está orgullosa del progreso que ha logrado hasta ahora. Durante el evento, García y Angie estaban esperando su transporte para viajar a casa, fuera de la escuela Hawkins Street, después de recoger cuadernos, lápices y otros materiales escolares gratuitos en preparación para el nuevo año escolar.\nTraducido por Bernardo de la Cruz\nEsta traducción fue proporcionada por New Jersey Hispano, en asociación con el Centro de Medios Cooperativos de la Universidad Estatal de Montclair, y cuenta con el apoyo financiero del Consorcio de Información Cívica de NJ.
