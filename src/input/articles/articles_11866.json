    "text": "310th SW cyber security civilian wins AFRC award for contributions to the ISR community Published Jan. 5, 2024 By Airman 1st Class Aaron Ketcham 310th Space Wing SCHRIEVER SPACE FORCE BASE, Colo. -- As the only space wing within the Air Force Reserve Command, the 310th Space Wing is continuously working to find innovative ways to improve support of space operations. 310th intelligence reconnaissance surveillance airmen face their own set of challenges within this endeavor. Erick Herzberg, the 310th SW information systems and security officer, has been pivotal in these efforts, creating qualitive solutions to these challenges by bringing new capabilities to the 310th ISR Airmen. Access to software that provides critical training opportunities and mission ready capabilities has not always been a guarantee for intel personnel within the wing, said Lt. Col. Nickolas Demakakos, senior intelligence officer, 310th Space Wing. 310th ISR Airmen are currently integrating with their active-duty counter parts within the Space Force to further inject themselves within space operations, but also relies on access to their software systems. “We had to beg to borrow time on their systems,” said Demakakos. “These were necessary capabilities that we needed for training and readiness and didn’t have unlimited access to. Mr. Herzberg is currently working on a three-network solution to implement a space modeling simulation and visualization software saving the wing roughly $150,000 in installations cost,” said Demakakos. “Not only will this save the wing money, but it delivers capability that has been missing for years.” In June, for his contributions to the 310th ISR mission, Herzberg has awarded the Air Force Reserve Command Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance contributor of the year award for 2023. “It was a surprise,” said Herzberg. “For me it’s not really about the award or accomplishments, but how I can best support the wing.” Herzberg was instrumental in communication efforts for ISR, implementing protocols that established a secure communications network across Vandenberg, Schriever, Peterson and Buckley, creating continuity between the bases that had previously been unavailable, said Demakakos. “Eric has been invaluable helping achieve our communication strategy for ISR within the wing,” said Demakakos. “Thanks to his efforts we’re now able to ensure connectivity and communicate in ways that we were unable to do before.”",

    "text": "[Passer au contenu principal](#main)\nAshley Moyer-Gleich, la 1re femme arbitre en séries de la NBA depuis 12 ans\nAshley Moyer-Gleich a vérifié ses courriels juste avant de se rendre à l'aéroport samedi, en vue d'un voyage qu'elle pensait être son dernier en lien au travail avant plusieurs mois.\nC'est alors que la nouvelle est arrivée : elle a encore des matchs à son horaire.\nMoyer-Gleich deviendra bientôt la deuxième femme de l'histoire de la NBA à arbitrer durant un match éliminatoire - et la première depuis 12 ans.\nElle est parmi les 36 arbitres nommés jeudi par le circuit en vue du premier tour des séries, qui débutera ce week-end.\n« C'est surréaliste, a déclaré Moyer-Gleich. Ça l'est vraiment. »\nElle rejoint Violet Palmer en tant que seule femme sélectionnée par la NBA pour les séries. Palmer a oeuvré lors de neuf matches entre 2006 et 2012.\nMoyer-Gleich, une ancienne joueuse de Division II à l'Université de Millersville, dans sa Pennsylvanie natale, a été promue au rang d'officielle de la NBA à temps plein en novembre 2018.\nElle a a pris part à plus de 200 matchs de saison régulière en six saisons. Elle, Marat Kogut et J.T. Orr feront leurs débuts en séries cette année.\n« J'ai obtenu quatre matchs où j'étais réserviste l'an dernier alors évidemment, mon objectif était de l'être à nouveau, juste pour soutenir la croissance que j'ai eue dans ma carrière, a dit Moyer-Gleich.\n« Et là j'ai vu mon nom sur la liste des officiels en activité. Ma mère était avec moi, elle est venue avec moi (à deux récents) matches, pour un petit voyage. Ouvrir ce courriel-là et l'avoir à mes côtés pour partager la nouvelle, c'était vraiment incroyable. »\nLa liste complète des arbitres au premier tour : Ray Acosta, Brent Barnaky, Curtis Blair, Tony Brothers, Nick Buchert, James Capers, Sean Corbin, Kevin Cutler, Marc Davis, JB DeRosa, Mitchell Ervin, Tyler Ford, Brian Forte, Scott Foster, Pat Fraher, Jacyn Goble, John Goble, David Guthrie, Bill Kennedy, Courtney Kirkland, Karl Lane, Mark Lindsay, Ed Malloy, Gediminas Petraitis, Kevin Scott, Aaron Smith, Ben Taylor, Dedric Taylor, Josh Tiven, Justin Van Duyne, James Williams, Sean Wright, Zach Zarba, Kogut, Orr et Moyer-Gleich.\n« Félicitations à ces 36 officiels pour l'honneur prestigieux et bien mérité d'officier lors des séries de la NBA, a déclaré le président des opérations de la ligue, Byron Spruell. Nous apprécions le professionnalisme, le dévouement et le travail d'équipe dont notre personnel d'arbitrage fait preuve quotidiennement, tout au long de la saison. »\nLa ligue réduit la liste des officiels pour chaque ronde, culminant généralement avec 12 personnes pour la finale de la NBA. Ces arbitres reçoivent des vestes d'échauffement blanches pour les matchs de la finale, une tradition depuis des années.\nMoyer-Gleich n'est pas encore là, mais elle est sur le point de s'en rapprocher.\n« Tout comme les séries sont convoitées, la veste blanche est encore plus convoitée, a t-elle confié. Évidemment, c'est une aspiration et c'est un objectif à long terme. Et j'espère que je pourrai continuer sur la même trajectoire, continuer à accroître mes responsabilités sur le terrain, peut-être passer d'arbitre à chef d'équipe à un moment donné, puis, avec un peu de chance, atteindre la finale – c'est la quintessence de ce qu'on fait.\n« Et que je sois la première ou non, je pense que le simple fait qu'une femme réussisse et obtienne cette opportunité-là, ça serait gigantesque. »",

    "text": "At the outset, Ratnalacheruru, a village near Mangalagiri in Guntur district, seems like a quiet place. It is 12 p.m., and except for occasional whistles from pressure cookers and chattering of men and women, the village seems to be wrapped in an all-encompassing silence. However, as one goes further inside the road that connects the National Highway-16 and the village, one can hear a faint hum of the looms and tunes of an old familiar song.\nFollowing the song takes one to the ‘bazaar’, a cluster of four to five worksheds. There are around 15 such sheds in Ratnalacheruvu. While the number of looms in every shed is not the same, every shed has more than 10 units.\nThe sheds, made by placing wooden logs loosely together, are a source of livelihood for many weavers who do not own a loom. The master weavers provide them with raw materials, and the weavers have to give the finished project in a time-bound manner.\nPlaying old S.P. Balasubrahmanyam songs loudly in the background so that the music does not drown in the chugging hum of the 23 looms, 60-year-old Venkateswara Rao and other weavers work with intense concentration. Heads bent over the pit loom, the weavers pulled the thread of the loom, giving life to the fabric.\nUnique ‘Nizam’ border Mangalagiri sarees are pure cotton fabrics, with the zari sourced from Surat in Gujarat. They are characterised by a lack of designs or ‘buttis’ on the body. The ‘Nizam’ border is unique to Mangalagiri sarees.\nMangalagiri’s connection with weaving goes back a long way. In her thesis, submitted to the University of Hyderabad for a Doctorate of Philosophy in History, P. Swarnalatha explains how important weaving was in the 18th century and why looms were confined to a few regions, including Mangalagiri.\nThe thesis, ‘The World of the Weaver in the Northern Coromandel, 1750-1850,’ was later converted into a book.\nIn it, she says: “During 1750-1850, the weaving industry constituted the most important occupation next to agriculture. The spatial location of all these communities and the distribution of weaving villages was conditioned by many factors like the availability of raw materials, proximity to the centres of raw materials, accessibility to nearby market centres and port towns, means of transport, and ecological factors.”\nLives weaved around Krishna river The deep black soils and medium black soils along the coast of the Pranahita, Godavari, and Krishna rivers support cotton crops extensively in the region, explaining the boom of the textile business in Mangalagiri and other areas.\nMangalagiri, however, has been seeing a decline in the weavers’ number for a long time. Venkateswara Rao is one of the few people still in the traditional weaving business. Many weavers have left to work as farm labourers, coolies, construction workers and other odd jobs.\nAccording to the information provided by Udaya Kumar, Assistant Director, Handlooms and Textiles, Guntur and Palnadu districts, there are 2,500 weavers and around 6,000 people in Mangalagiri Assembly constituency, represented by Human Resources Minister Nara Lokesh, involved in the ancillary activities such as dyeing, sizing of a saree, prin winding, warping, etc. The number of looms in the constituency stands at around 1,500.\n“There used to be 10,000 looms earlier in the constituency. In the past 25-30 years, so much has changed,” says Venkateswara Rao, adding that no youngster wants to be in this profession. However, his son is a weaver since Venkateswara Rao did not have enough income to educate his two sons. His younger son works at a gold shop.\nVenkateswara Rao has been working on a blue-coloured cotton saree since 8 a.m., the time he usually comes to work here. If he works continuously from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., he can weave five cotton sarees in a week. There is no concept of Sundays for him. They take a day off work only on the new moon day. Depending on the time spent, he can make a saree in a day or two.\nDespite his weariness and frustration from inadequate wages, he does not let the same affect the saree. “I have been in the business of weaving for the past 40 years. I studied till Class V and have known no other work except this. If only I had known, I would not be doing the work,” Venkateswara Rao says, sitting on the ground with his legs suspended in a pit dug out to put the loom.\nWhen asked about the reason, he says that apart from insufficient wages, the profession has little to offer them, forcing many weavers, most of whom belong to the Padmashali community, to look for other livelihood options. He is not eligible for financial aid under many schemes except for an old-age pension. “None of us from the worksheds received the aid under the YSR Nethanna Nestham because only those who owned a loom were eligible for it,” Venkateswara Rao says.\nKeeping tradition alive Ratnalacheruvu is one of the few villages, apart from Atmakuru, Kanagala, Ilavaram, Bhattiprolu, etc., all located around Mangalagiri, where the traditional weaving is still alive, despite the tough competition from powerlooms.\nThe reasons for the decline are multifarious. One of them is that the earnings are not sufficient to sustain themselves. “Even rag pickers must be earning more than us. They say we are artists, and they talk of respecting the weavers, but it is just fluff. Nothing has been done for the weaver community so far,” he says.\nThese days, for five sarees done in a week, Venkateswara Rao gets ₹3,150, depending on the type of saree. If it is a pattu saree (silk), the wages are higher as they require more time and labour. Out of ₹12,000-13,000 he gets in a month, ₹3,000 is spent on rent, around ₹400 on the current bills, and the same amount on getting medicines.\nThe situation was not always so bad. The earliest reference to Mangalagiri sarees tells us about the kind of patronage the traditional weaving process enjoyed in the old days. According to the information provided in the application seeking a grant of Geographical Indication (GI) tag for Mangalagiri sarees, the traditional weaving here has its roots way back in the 16th century.\nThe applicants say that there was a time when pilgrims visiting the Panakala Narasimha Swamy temple in Mangalagiri had to definitely buy a saree from a local weaver, explains Macherla Mohan Rao, founder president of the State Handloom Weavers’ Federation, that handlooms lost their value when the central government started encouraging the import of raw materials for linen and polyester in 1985.\n“The fabric made out of imported raw materials was made available in domestic markets at cheap rates. That was the beginning of the decrease in the demand for handloom products. Later, over the years, the situation was exacerbated with the advent of powerlooms,” he explains.\nThe Central government introduced the concept of power-operated machines for the first time in Virudhunagar in Tamil Nadu. The concept has now reached Mangalagiri, Venkatagiri and Chirala, replacing the hard work of weavers with machines. With powerlooms duplicating the same fabric at a cheaper cost, consumers tend to buy them, leaving handloom weavers without market, Mr. Mohan Rao says.\nSri Leela, a weaver in another nearby shed, says despite working for years, they do not have a house of their own. Unlike her male counterparts, she takes 15 days to weave five sarees since she has household chores. For five sarees, most of them pattu, she is paid around ₹5,000.\n‘Education, a distant dream’ “We do not have enough to eat three meals a day. Educating children is a distant dream for us. Sitting on a pit loom for hours together takes a toll on our bodies. Still, we cannot afford hospital bills too, so we visit registered medical practitioners (RMPs) and take over-the-counter medicines for pain relief,” she adds.\nUnlike other weaves, Mangalagiri sarees can be woven on a pit loom alone, according to the information in the GI tag application. Weaving on a pit loom renders the fabric toughness and durability, the two things the saree is known for. A Nizam border is best woven on a pit loom since it requires the application of pressure to weave the edge of a saree without gaps and frays. All the looms in the sheds are pit looms, and with them comes the physical inconvenience.\nThe sadder part is that she has never worn a Mangalagiri saree herself. This is not just about Sri Leela alone but also about weavers in general. The products of their labour not reaching them frustrate them, but they have to do it anyway for their livelihood, they say.\nA woman sorting the threads of yarn before proceeding to weave a saree on a handloom in Mangalagiri, Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh. | Photo Credit: G.N. Rao\n“While we get ₹500 per saree, the products we create are sold at ₹1,800 each. We can never afford to buy them. When the master weaver spots damage, which is not rare, the saree comes back to us. But, we have to pay the full amount for the damaged product too,” explains G. Nagamalleswari while spinning a yarn at her home in Atmakuru village.\nHer husband G. Thirupattaiah weaves the sarees while Nagamalleswari helps him with the process, such as getting the yarn ready and dyeing it, among other things. Unlike Sri Leela and Venkateswara Rao, the couple owns a house and a pit loom. Their sons, too, are not in the profession. The couple received financial aid under the YSR Nethanna Nestham.\nIn search of greener pastures Nagamalleswari points out how many of her acquaintances had left for agriculture work. “Both of us could not go because we suffer from severe backache. Once you get habituated to weaving, you cannot do any other work,” she says.\nVenkateswara Rao sums up their predicament in one line. “Mangalagiri is nothing but ‘peru goppa, ooru dibba’ (Except for the big name, there is nothing really great here),” he says, even as he expressed gratitude to Minister Nara Lokesh for distributing ₹25,000 to all weavers in the constituency after the Budameru floods destroyed the looms and increasing the old-age pension from ₹3,000 to ₹4,000.\nIn February, Heritage Foods Ltd Executive Director Nara Brahmani launched ‘Weavershala’, a Tata Company by Taneira, in Mangalagiri, to upskill weavers.\nAt present, there are 20 looms with advanced technologies. The seats are designed to reduce pressure on the spinal cord.\nMr. Mohan Rao said while the intent was right, such power-operated handlooms, or semi-powerlooms would bring doom on the traditional weaving.\nHe added that the governments introduced powerlooms in the name of ‘drudgery reduction’ and welfare of weavers by saying that powerlooms would reduce the inconvenience associated with pit looms.\n“But, if they cared about weavers, they would have asked textile engineers to work out ways to reduce pressure on the pedestal instead of replacing the whole loom with a powerloom,” he says, lamenting that the successive governments failed in conducting elections for cooperative societies from 2013 in both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.\nIf the government really wants to help traditional weavers, it should encourage traditional weaving methods, stop the influx of power-operated machines, and educate people about the difference between handloom and powerloom products.\nPublished - November 29, 2024 11:06 pm IST\nRead Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",
