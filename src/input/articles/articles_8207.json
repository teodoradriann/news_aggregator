    "text": "Mt. Crescent readying for opening day after delays from Mother Nature OMAHA, Neb. (WOWT) - The weather has been above normal for a number of weeks and the [Mt. Crescent Ski Area](https://skicrescent.com/) has had to push back it’s opening day. Warmer weather means it’s taking longer for its snow machines to do their job. 6 News got a glimpse of the work underway at the ski resort. Snow is in progress at Mt. Crescent Ski Area, as crews were working hard to make sure their whole chunk of land snow is covered in icy slush. progress at mount crescent ski area “It’s taking us a little longer,” said Dan Borgalia said. “We’re pumping out as much water as we can.” Borgalia is in charge of making the snow for the county-owned attraction. He told 6 News the weather needs to be about 20 degrees outside for the machines to make snow. “We got a pump house here that’s pumping out about 380 PSI of water that can make about 1,800 gallons of water a minute,” Borgalia said. “That water can pump [tubes] here and into the snow machines then [snow] comes out in the cold air.” Without the cold air, the snow machines are just making rain and instead of covering the area with snow, creating a muddy mess. “Last season, we were able to open right before the holidays as it was freezing cold,” said Kylie Jacott with Pottawattamie Conservation. “This year temperatures are the complete opposite of that.” Jacott said situations like these aren’t really a surprise. She and her team are doing what they can to make sure to provide everyone with a full winter season. “Mother nature really has to be on our side cause we need that optimum temperature to get those water droplets to mix with the air and make that perfect snow,” Borgalia said. Mt. Crescent originally planned to potentially open Dec. 30th. Now, they’re looking to possibly open on Jan. 3. Despite the delays, they still expect to provide an 8-to-10-week season. The lodge is open Thursday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. for pass holders to pick up their pass before the season begins. Copyright 2023 WOWT. All rights reserved.",

    "text": "Rafael Nadal has suffered a thigh injury to put his participation at the Paris Olympics in doubt, his coach Carlos Moya said on Thursday. The 14-time French Open champion is scheduled to play in the singles and in the men’s doubles alongside rising star and fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz at Roland Garros. “He had some discomfort yesterday (Wednesday) morning,” Moya told Spanish radio. “In the afternoon he was more limited and before it got worse he decided to stop.” The 38-year-old Nadal did not train on Thursday, which Moya said was “the most responsible thing to do”. “Don’t force it at the moment and see if he recovers well,” he added. “We will see what condition he’s in tomorrow and Saturday.” Nadal returned to tennis this year after a lengthy absence with a hip injury, reaching his first ATP final since winning the 2022 French Open in Bastad last weekend before losing to Portugal’s Nuno Borges. He is scheduled to face Hungarian Marton Fucsovics in the singles first round on Sunday, the day after partnering Alcaraz in the doubles. If Nadal defeats Fucsovics, he would set up a possible second-round meeting with old rival Novak Djokovic. “I can’t guarantee anything, neither that he won’t play or he will play,” said Moya. “At the moment he needs to rest, undergo treatment. “He is obviously very excited to play these Olympics. It has been something marked on his calendar for years. “He is a born competitor and wants to play singles and doubles. He’s very excited about the doubles with Alcaraz. It will be the first time they have played together and it will be something historic for Spanish tennis.” Nadal is a two-time Olympic champion, having won singles gold in Beijing in 2008, and doubles gold at the 2016 Rio Games alongside Marc Lopez.",

Hamada Hassan told CBS News that no one had enough space in their home to host everyone, so they set up tables outside. It only continued to grow from there.

Ahmed Ekram, an organizer said this year 10,000 meals were served, Gulf News reported, citing local media. Some in attendance didn't eat, but went to simply enjoy the camaraderie, CBS News reported. Local donations fund the costs of the event, which over the years has seen politicians, celebrities, and diplomats in attendance. “We do not care about the cost, as all the residents of the neighborhood participate in financing the table in order to bring joy and happiness to the people of the region and other neighboring areas,\" Ahmed Khalaf, one of the organizers of the 2023 event told [Arab News](https://www.arabnews.com/node/2284791/middle-east) at the time.",

    "title": "Opinion: Christ put his trust in women, why won’t more LDS men?",
    "text": "Though my great-grandpa lived to be 102 years old, I don’t have any memories of him. But President Russell M. Nelson likely does. Probably a lot of the members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles do. My great-grandpa, Joseph Anderson, was secretary to the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from 1922 to 1970. In 1970, then-President Joseph Fielding Smith called him to be an assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Six years later, Papa, as we call him, became a member of the Quorum of the Seventy. He was a general authority (emeritus) until the day he died. As a devout Mormon youth, I wished I could ask Papa how he felt OK eating out every Sunday at Sizzler —supposedly breaking the Sabbath while being a general authority. As an adult, I wish I could ask him how felt about the changes, large and small, within the church in his lifetime. Was he surprised by the end of the priesthood and temple ban on Black members? What did he think of the many different efforts of Mormon feminists that he saw come and go? Women, for decades, have been vocalizing changes the church could make to improve conditions for female members. Of course, not all women are uncomfortable with the power imbalance within the current church organization. However, it is important to note that equality is not a feeling. Just because someone doesn’t feel uncomfortable doesn’t mean there is equality or that they have a say in the matter. Whenever I talk on social media about sexism within the church, the most common response I get from men — sometimes women — is, “What specifically do you want to be changed?” What it usually boils down to is, because they haven’t sincerely listened to women who speak out on this topic or put much serious thought into the matter, the only change they expect me to say is women receiving ordination to the priesthood. They see this option as simply unimaginable so they don’t expect the conversation to go much further. The practice of dismissing women’s concerns is not new to our church. Brigham Young said, “... if you see females huddling together, veto the concern.” However, Christ set a different example that I believe all members, female and male, would benefit from considering. It is especially fitting because a prime example of how Christ regarded women took place on that first Easter morning. In John 20:11-18 , we read an account of the resurrected savior appearing first to Mary Magdalene. In Luke 24:1-10 , we learn that he also appeared to two other women, Joanna and Mary — the mother of James — before appearing to any of his ordained male apostles. The resurrected Lord, our savior Jesus Christ, chose women as his first witnesses and trusted messengers of the news of his resurrection. Shockingly, the male apostles did not believe the women as “their words seemed to them as idle tales.” However, these women, ordained or not, were chosen by Jesus himself for possibly the most important calling in Christianity. Shockingly, this calling and responsibility had nothing to do with children. While the whole “men need the priesthood to keep them on the straight and narrow” trope makes me want to scream from the city walls of Zarahemla, the lesson I’m choosing to focus on is that Jesus chose women regardless of formal titles (though I’m not opposed to women having them and think they hold value.) He trusted women. He believed in and valued women for all their unique and different abilities — including those that don’t involve children. The called, set-apart, anointed, ordained men did not. They did not respect the great and sacred responsibility Jesus placed upon these women to be his first witnesses. I believe that we see this same pattern of behavior today. Significantly more women, ordained or not, should be speaking at General Conference . All members, men and women, should have the opportunity to learn from just as many women as men. If not, we are living beneath more than 50% of our privileges. If women really are the more spiritual sex, as benevolent patriarchy asserts them to be, then shouldn’t we be the ones teaching and guiding the members at a 10-to-1 ratio? Or am I misunderstanding boy-math? Young women should be allowed to pass the sacrament. Again, Jesus chose women to share the news of his resurrection. Surely he would be OK with women sharing the bread and water that is in remembrance of his sacrifice. It almost feels a little more authentic, if I’m being honest. Include women in all levels of Sunday school leadership. Appoint female ward mission leaders. Stop telling young women that they aren’t needed on missions. Include women in the interviewing and vetting process of looking for new Stake Presidents. Allow women to make callings within their stewardship without male approval. Empower the Relief Society to return to its former autonomy. Let women resume giving blessings. Correct Brigham Young’s edits to Eliza R. Snow’s notes from the organization of the Relief Society by Joseph Smith. Have female leaders sit on the stand in sacrament meetings for all the same reasons men do. Call women to be ward clerks. Organize top ward leadership’s responsibilities so they are equally invested in the female youth as they are the male youth. Take to heart Brigham Young University’s own research and level out the balance of women and men in church councils from the ward level up to the general church councils. Teach and expect men to carry their equal share of the mental and physical load of being a parent, as I’m sure Heavenly Father does. Respect, revere, and seek Heavenly Mother in the same way we do Heavenly Father. Again, while some of these ideas may be new to general membership, they are not new to our leaders. Women have been vocalizing these for a very long time. While we do believe that Christ is the head of the church, daily direction is left to the discernment and understanding of a group of humans. The Bible and Book of Mormon are full of accounts of the male leaders getting things wrong. Even the very apostles who walked with our savior on this Earth got things very wrong. Why would today’s leaders be any different? Are we missing an important scriptural lesson by assuming otherwise? Like a biblical version of America Ferrera’s monologue in “Barbie ,” I feel so much solidarity with the women from Easter morning. I am choosing to trust the faith Christ put in women, regardless of what some men believe. I’m not waiting for other humans to follow Jesus’s example before I answer his call. I hope other women will do the same. Rosemary Card is an entrepreneur, author and passionate advocate for women’s rights, inclusion and nuanced cultural conversations.

    "text": "El problema de la confianza en la Iglesia\nMás de la mitad de los españoles dice pertenecer a una religión, pero el nivel de religiosidad es muy bajo y no se confía en los sacerdotes\nFue Benedicto XVI quien dijo que «el cristianismo es la religión de la confianza, no del miedo». José Carlos Martín de la Hoz es un historiador de la Iglesia que sostiene que la clave interpretativa que hay que utilizar para desentrañar el sentido de la Iglesia ... en la historia es la confianza. Sin confianza no hay Iglesia, lo mismo que la fe, si es algo, es ser fiable.\nHace unos días, la Fundación BBVA ha hecho públicas dos investigaciones que deben interpelar a la conciencia cristiana en la España hoy. La primera sobre las creencia y prácticas alternativas, con interesantes datos sobre el papel de la verdad en nuestras vidas; la segunda sobre la confianza.\nDe la referida a la creencia destaco que la mitad de los españoles (53%) dice pertenecer a una religión. Dentro de ese grupo, el 86% se confiesan católicos, pero el nivel de religiosidad en España es muy bajo, 3,7 de una escala de 0 a 10, con casi el 40% de la población en la posición más baja de la escala.\nOjo porque la mayoría de los encuestados están de acuerdo en que «la religión no da respuestas hoy a cuestiones importantes de la vida». Si la fe no es para la vida, ¿para qué es? También se destaca que la ciencia y la religión coexisten sin especiales problemas.\nSobre la investigación acerca de la confianza se concluye que la religión, que tuvo en su momento altos niveles de confianza, genera ahora un nivel bastante modesto de confianza, un 3,9 de una escala 0 a 10. El 39% de los preguntados no tiene ninguna confianza en la Iglesia, sólo el 16% la tienen alta.\nPor cierto que la confianza en los sacerdotes es nula o mínima en el 36% y alta en el 12%. Está muy lejos de la que se tiene respecto a los científicos, los médicos, los maestros, los policías, los militares…\nNo creo sinceramente que estos resultados deban servir para fustigarse. Sí para pensar qué es lo que hace que la fe sea fiable y la Iglesia confiable en una sociedad plural.\ninicia sesión\nEsta funcionalidad es sólo para suscriptores\nSuscribete",

    "text": "At the former Nazi extermination camp of Birkenau, where hundreds of thousands of Jews were murdered during World War II, thousands gathered Monday to mark Holocaust Remembrance Day by singing the Israeli anthem in a deeply symbolic act of defiance and resilience.\nThis year's March of the Living, an annual educational program that brings people from around the world to Poland to study the Holocaust, took on heightened significance in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack in Israel – the deadliest antisemitic attack since WWII. Some 1,200 Israelis were brutally murdered in the Hamas onslaught, shattering the vow of \"never again.\"\n﻿ Video: Live footage of the March of the Living\nThe main march from Auschwitz to Birkenau on Monday drew 8,000 participants from dozens of countries, including 55 Holocaust survivors. Speakers drew parallels between the Nazi genocide and the recent events, with the march held under the theme of \"solidarity and shared fate with the Jewish people.\"\n\"We stand here facing all our enemies, who seek time and again to harm us,\" Doron Almog, chairman of the Jewish Agency, said at an opening ceremony Sunday in Budapest marking 80 years since the Holocaust in Hungary. \"In the spirit of [Jewish heroines] Hannah Senesh , in the spirit of Rose Lubin , in the spirit of thousands of soldiers who left everything and fought for the Jewish people, and for the State of Israel.\"\nAt Birkenau, seven torches were lit representing various commemorations - for Hungarian Jewish victims, all Holocaust victims, the commitment to fight antisemitism, Jewish unity, Holocaust education, the Righteous Among the Nations, and the rebirth of the Jewish people with Israel's founding.\nThe diverse participants included a delegation of Oct. 7 victims and their families, university presidents from the US seeking to counter campus antisemitism and Israeli singer Noa Kirel, descended from a Holocaust survivor grandfather.\n\"In such a difficult year for the Jewish people, I will march proudly...to cry out against antiדemitism,\" Kirel stated.\nRelated Posts Print Collector/Getty Images Have Israeli Holocaust historians found the elusive smoking gun on Hitler?
