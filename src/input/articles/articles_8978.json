    "text": "So you’ve decided to take a gamble on an electric vehicle, but you’d like to keep the ante down for getting into the game. There are lots of good reasons not to spend the kids’ college fund on the fanciest, six-figure EV — namely, sending them to college. Related: [Electric Vehicles: Understanding the Terminology](/articles/electric-vehicles-understanding-the-terminology-440188/) You might be just looking for an efficient second car for city use or commuting in high occupancy vehicle lanes, where it makes little sense to pay top dollar for 400 miles of range when a 200-mile EV would serve your needs.

Or the [higher-than-expected cost to install Level 2 home charging](/articles/what-it-cost-to-outfit-six-homes-with-ev-chargers-447239/), all but essential to owning an EV, might have shrunk your budget for the car itself.

    "text": "In a significant blow to organized crime, the RCMP's Pacific Region Federal Policing Program has seized more than 30,000 kilograms of chemicals believed to be intended for synthetic drug production. The operation took place on September 11, on a rural property in Enderby, British Columbia.The RCMP’s Clandestine Laboratory Enforcement and Response (CLEAR) Team executed a search warrant on the property, which also resulted in the recovery of a stolen Bobcat skid-steer loader that had been reported missing in Kelowna in 2021. Additionally, a vehicle registered to the recently deceased Donald \\\"Donnie\\\" Lyons was found on the premises.Investigators believe the chemicals were bound for large-scale drug production, potentially capable of manufacturing hundreds of kilograms of methamphetamine. “This seizure represents the removal of millions of dollars of profit from the hands of organized crime,” said Insp. Peter Koster. The bust has disrupted a significant supply chain that could have funneled harmful synthetic drugs into Canadian communities.While no charges have been laid yet, the investigation is ongoing. The CLEAR Team, a specialized unit within the RCMP, focuses on dismantling clandestine drug labs and the diversion of chemical precursors used in illegal drug manufacturing.Anyone with information about drug-related crimes is encouraged to contact local police or BC Crime Stoppers. For those struggling with addiction, help is available through the BC Alcohol and Drug Information and Referral Service Line at 1-800-663-1441.",

    "text": "NEW DELHI, Mar 7:\nThe armed forces are well equipped, capable and ready to give a befitting reply if anyone casts an evil eye on India, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Thursday against the backdrop of the nearly four-year border row with China in eastern Ladakh and concerns over Chinese military forays into the Indian Ocean.\nSingh emphasised that the country’s defence system has been “induced with a new energy” by the Government in line with people’s vision and it has resulted in India emerging as a powerful nation on the global stage with a strong and self-reliant military.\nIn an address at a defence summit hosted by the NDTV, he also said that India’s defence apparatus is today stronger than ever as the Modi Government has been focusing on bolstering it with the “sentiment of Indianness”.\nHe termed ‘perspective’ as the major difference between the current and the previous dispensations, stating that the present Government ardently believes in the capabilities of the people of India, while those in power earlier were somewhat sceptical about their potential.\n“Today, our forces possess a strong willpower due to a powerful leadership at the centre. We are working continuously towards keeping the morale of the soldiers high,” Singh said.\n“They are equipped, capable and ready to give a befitting reply to anyone who casts an evil eye on India,” he said.\nThe Indian and Chinese troops are locked in an over three-and-half-year confrontation in certain friction points in eastern Ladakh even as the two sides completed disengagement from several areas following extensive diplomatic and military talks.\nSingh described promoting ‘Aatmanirbharta’ (self-reliance) in defence manufacturing as the biggest change brought about by the Government, saying it is giving a new shape to India’s defence sector.\nHe also highlighted various measures rolled out by the Defence Ministry for achieving self-reliance in the defence sector, including setting up of defence industrial corridors in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, reserving 75 per cent of the capital procurement budget for domestic industry and corporatisation of the Ordnance Factory Board among others.\n“The annual defence production, which was around Rs 40,000 crore in 2014, has now crossed a record Rs 1.10 lakh crore,” he said.\n“The defence exports today have touched Rs 16,000 crore from a meagre Rs 1,000 crore nine-ten years ago. We have set a target to achieve Rs 50,000 crore of exports by 2028-29,” he said.\nThe Defence Minister asserted that when it comes to technology, developing countries have two options — innovation and imitation — and New Delhi is laying special emphasis on making the country a technology creator rather than a follower.\n“Imitating technology from developed countries is not wrong for those whose innovation capacity and human resources have not reached the level required to produce new technologies,” he said.\n“If a country imitates technology from other nations, it still moves ahead from old technology, however, the problem is that one becomes addicted to imitation and gets used to second-class technology,” he said.\nThis forces them to fall 20-30 years behind a developed country, he said.\n“Losing national self-confidence is a bigger problem as one always remains a technology follower. This mentality comes into your culture, ideology, literature, lifestyle and philosophy,” Singh said.\n“Prime Minister Narendra Modi calls this follower mentality as the mindset of slavery,” he said.\nThe defence Minister described it as the duty of the Government, media as well as intelligentsia to guide the nation out of the mindset of slavery.\n“We should possess knowledge about others, but we must be aware of our national heritage too, and feel proud of it,” the Defence Minister said.

    "text": "10 Signs You're Addicted To Loving A Cheater, According To Psychology And the psychological reason you can't get rid of him. You discover your man is cheating, and you know he's bad for you. Your friends tell you to dump him, but the truth is, you still want him. If the pull is unbearably strong, maybe [it's not love that you feel, but addiction](https://www.yourtango.com/2017307348/signs-youre-addicted-love-and-how-break-addiction). Do you do any of the following? Here are 10 signs you're addicted to loving a cheater, according to psychology: 1. You confront him about the calls on his phone from other women He comes up with excuses, and you know they're lame, but you accept them anyway. 2. He says it's your fault that he cheated on you The worst part? You agree with him. 3. You keep telling yourself that if you could just be more loving, patient, attractive, etc., he would make you his one-and-only That's not how love works. 4. You apologize to him for things you didn't do or say You take the blame for all of his bad moods. 5. You tell him it's over and storm out, only to call or text him, begging to get back together This happens time and time again. RDNE Stock project / Pexels 6. You keep trying to prove that you're better than the other woman (or women) He didn't see your worth back then, he certainly isn't going to now. 7. You go overboard trying to help him Even though [he treats you badly](https://www.yourtango.com/heartbreak/why-does-he-treat-like-crap). 8. Your friends and family question his behavior You just make excuses for him. 9. You stalk him In real life and online. 10. He promises that this time will be different, and he really will end it with her You make yourself believe him. Again. How does this happen? First of all, understand this: All romantic love is addictive. Anyone who falls madly in love behaves just like an addict, according to [research done by anthropologist Dr. Helen Fisher](https://www.helenfisher.com/downloads/articles/Fisher-et-al-Rejection.pdf), a biological anthropologist at Rutgers University. In her scientific articles, she explains the similarities between lovers and addicts: - You're both intensely focused on your reward — either your lover or the drug. - You both feel mood swings, cravings, obsession, and compulsion. - You both experience distortion of reality, emotional dependence, personality changes, risk-taking, and loss of self-control. Romantic love can be a constructive addiction when your love is returned, Dr. Fisher says. But if your love isn't returned, the addiction can be highly destructive. Dr. Fisher explains your first reaction to rejected love is \"protest\" — you obsessively try to win back your partner. You may even feel more passionately in love than when you were together. Why? Because you've bonded to your lover. All love is about bonding — the psychological and emotional attachment that you feel towards him. The psychological bond forms at the beginning of the relationship, when you feel the giddy pleasure of a new romance. But what happens when [you discover your man is cheating on you](https://www.yourtango.com/heartbreak/if-he-cheated-do-these-things-immediately)? You may be angry, but you may also feel fear and anxiety about possibly losing your relationship. And surprisingly, this doesn't drive you away from your lover. [According to research from the National Library of Medicine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8193053/), fear and anxiety strengthen the psychological bond that you feel for him. When the guy is a cheater, this becomes a vicious cycle: - In the beginning, before you knew of his deception, the pleasure of your new romance created a psychological bond. - He cheats and you feel fear and anxiety, which strengthens the bond. - You kiss and make up, which strengthens the bond again. - He takes you on a rollercoaster of cheating and reuniting. With each go-round, the psychological bond you feel gets stronger and stronger. The vicious cycle of cheating and reuniting could [lead to a \"trauma bond.\"](https://www.yourtango.com/heartbreak/signs-trauma-bonding-most-people-miss) Some cheaters aren't just guys who can't make up their minds; some cheaters are exploiters. \"Exploitative relationships create betrayal bonds,\" says Dr. Patrick J. Carnes in his book called [The Betrayal Bond](https://www.amazon.com/Betrayal-Bond-Breaking-Exploitive-Relationships/dp/0757318231/ref=sr_1_1?crid=25V9FDNDV9W0U&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Qy3CKw6v3NOtgW2KCqZFwBfE74SMnkOli7YH8VkpLsQ6hbREqGM5o-nBrd3l4GhRWcn4Nq9Yz0NU5TXekkKYhfeLPYCxv4xcFyn2-ig-Xt_brZVbqhW64ptoXHCFuzZziM3mOt8xX05O9Mgs2iYcmetFuQZ1XUx5Yi04iw6SbVhgA7IBtZ9NJNluKnP6QZFop9nInZg1qzWTlcfBAV1m_LwGgyd3uknz6FUf5kpUGPM.1g2qdxgXveT9dTPbo7mqwYv9wnKzpakFHvnwFphaUms&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Betrayal+Bond&qid=1724869496&sprefix=the+betrayal+bond%2Caps%2C143&sr=8-1). Also described as a trauma bond, this occurs when you bond with someone destructive to you. Trauma bonds, Dr. Carnes explains, are addictive. You feel a compulsion to continue the relationship, despite the adverse consequences. You're obsessed with the relationship. If you recognize yourself in this article, you're probably already aware that your involvement with [this man isn't healthy](https://www.yourtango.com/heartbreak/immediate-signs-toxic-dangerous). So, what do you do? You treat it like an addiction. You \"go on the wagon\" by breaking off the relationship and having no contact with this man. This may seem daunting. How can you possibly cut him out of your life? The answer is to take it one day at a time, just like in a 12-step program. And if you need support, seek competent help. If you think you may be experiencing depression or anxiety as a result of ongoing emotional abuse, you are not alone. Domestic abuse can happen to anyone and is not a reflection of who you are or anything you've done wrong. If you feel as though you may be in danger, there is support available 24/7/365 through the National Domestic Violence Hotline by calling 1-800-799-7233.

    "text": "A hard-hit Israeli kibbutz has announced the death of Judith Weinstein — an American-Canadian-Israeli woman who had been thought to be held hostage in Gaza. The news came six days after Ms Weinstein’s husband, Gad Haggai, was also declared dead. Ms Weinstein, 70, and Mr Haggai, 73, were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on the morning of October 7 when Hamas militants burst across the border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others. In the early hours of the morning, Ms Weinstein was able to call emergency services and let them know that both she and her husband had been shot and send a message to her family. Ms Weinstein and her husband had been thought to be among the hostages still held in captivity in Gaza. But six days ago, the kibbutz announced that Mr Haggai was killed on October 7 and his body was taken to Gaza. On Thursday, the kibbutz said it had learned that Ms Weinstein was also killed on October 7 and her body is also being held in Gaza. It was not immediately clear how Israeli authorities determined their deaths. The couple are survived by two sons and two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbutz said. US President Joe Biden said he was “devastated” to learn of Ms Weinstein’s death, especially after hearing about the couple during a meeting with their daughter. The families “have been living through hell for weeks. No family should have to endure such an ordeal”, he said in a statement. Ms Weinstein was born in New York and was an active member of Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border where she taught English to children with special needs. The kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza. Mr Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician. “Judy dedicated her life to serving others, spending years teaching English and using her passions for poetry, puppeteering, and mindfulness to empower children of all backgrounds,” her family said in a statement. Al Haggai, one of the couple’s sons, told Israel’s Channel 13 that the family had originally hoped their mother’s multiple citizenships would allow her to be released during the week-long ceasefire in late November, when 105 hostages were let go. Almost all were women and children. He said that when his mother’s name was not on any of the daily lists, he started to suspect that something had happened to her. According to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, at least 23 of the approximately 129 hostages believed to be held in Gaza have either died or been killed in captivity. Nir Oz was one of the hardest-hit Israeli communities on October 7, with roughly a quarter of its residents killed or kidnapped. The families of missing hostages have drawn widespread support and sympathy in Israel as they press the government to reach a new ceasefire deal to bring home their loved ones. Mr Netanyahu met on Thursday in Tel Aviv with some of the families, where he told them there were behind-the-scene efforts to bring the hostages home, according to a statement from his office. “I can’t elaborate on the details, we are working to return everyone,” he said.
