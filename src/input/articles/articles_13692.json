    "title": "'Diversity is not illegal': Women in skilled trades brace for Trump's DEI rollbacks",
    "text": "President Donald Trump’s executive orders repealing diversity, equity and inclusion policies could worsen workplace conditions for women in skilled trades, where harassment is common, tradeswomen leaders said. The trades — occupations such as construction, welding and carpentry — have some of the smallest shares of female workers in the U.S., but they offer high salaries and competitive benefits, especially so for those without college degrees. The Trump administration is trying to roll back what it has deemed “illegal DEI” practices, but many nonprofits, including a tradeswomen’s advocacy group in Chicago, are fighting back in court. President Donald Trump ‘s executive orders restricting and repealing diversity, equity and inclusion policies bring a rash of uncertainties about what lies ahead for women and other minority groups in the workforce.\nThese changes create a particularly fraught environment for women in skilled trades — occupations such as construction, welding and carpentry.\nSkilled trades offer competitive salaries and benefits, especially so for those without a college education, but they have some of the smallest shares of female workers among all occupations in the U.S., according to a government survey . The Institute for Women’s Policy Research, which compiled data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics, also reported that in 2023, women comprised 4.3% of workers in construction and extraction occupations, which include construction laborers, carpenters and electricians.\nKina McAfee, who has been involved in the skilled trades for 40 years, said she has seen discrimination persist across the trades. Harassment is common, she said, and at smaller worksites, a tradeswoman will often find herself the sole female worker.\nA 2021 study from the Institute for Women’s Policy Research that surveyed women in trades showed 47.7% report they are held to a different standard than their male co-workers, face discrimination in many aspects of their work and sometimes deal with “an unsupportive if not hostile” environment. More than a quarter of the study’s respondents said they are always or frequently harassed for being a woman. The report also found that 44.4% of women in the study have seriously considered leaving the industry, with most citing discrimination or a lack of respect as reasons to leave.\nMcAfee worked as a carpenter between 1985 and 1995 in Chicago before becoming an instructor. She is now a coordinator for a carpenter’s union, guiding women in its apprentice program.\nIn an interview with CNBC, McAfee said some of the women she has spoken with have faced overt incidents of harassment, often verbal, and sometimes of a sexual nature. She said a tradeswoman told her that a foreman hit her on the buttocks with a shovel in front of other workers. Another woman told her that a worker locked her in a porta-potty on a jobsite, McAfee said, and one tradeswoman told her that a co-worker fondled her while on a lunch break.\n“I just can’t count the number of young apprentices that come to me with some kind of … really bad story like this,” McAfee said. “But they refuse to allow us to contact their company. Because still, even in this day and age, you can be blacklisted and not be able to work.”\nMcAfee said these complaints have slowed somewhat over the past few years and that more men are willing to work alongside women than when she started in the field.\nBut she and other tradeswomen and nonprofit leaders across the country said Trump’s attack on DEI policies and the ideas behind them will erode that progress — and embolden some workers to discriminate against women.\n‘What the government was looking for’ On the first day of Trump’s second term in office he signed an executive order titled “ Ending Radical And Wasteful DEI Programs and Preferencing ,” which rescinded policies requiring federal contractors to promote diversity and affirmative action.\nThe next day he issued another order, “ Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity ,” which rolled back an array of executive orders issued over the past 60 years intended to curtail discrimination, including those meant to bolster the Equal Employment Opportunity Act.\n“In the prior Trump administration, we found that violence and harassment of women increased on job sites without all of these anti-DEI initiatives,” said Meg Vasey, who worked as an electrician for 20 years and now serves as a policy committee co-chair for the National Taskforce on Tradeswomen’s Issues .\n“This, no doubt, will increase and intensify that, not just for women, but for people of color, and then double for women of color,” Vasey said. “It’s anecdotal, but it’s national, and it’s clearly only going to intensify as things go.”\nChicago Women in Trades Jayne Vellinga. Jayne Vellinga, executive director of nonprofit group Chicago Women in Trades , which trains and provides resources to tradeswomen, told CNBC her organization wouldn’t exist without federal incentives for diversity, which have helped bring more women into the skilled trades.\nVellinga said DEI efforts by President Joe Biden ‘s administration led to a palpable difference in the industry, with positive changes she thought weren’t possible a decade ago, and notably better reception from contractors, unions and apprenticeships.\nShe noted that a U.S. Commerce Department initiative, “Million Women in Construction,” announced by former Secretary Gina Raimondo in 2022 aimed to double the number of women in the industry to 2 million over the next decade.\n“Understanding this is what the government was looking for, I think, created a level of receptivity that was unique, at least in my experience here at Chicago Women in Trades, which is 25 years,” she said.\n‘Diversity is not illegal’ Chicago Women in Trades, which receives federal grants to help support its programs, is one of several nonprofits to sue the administration over Trump’s executive orders on DEI. The organization’s lawsuit alleges that the orders are vague and unconstitutional and will prohibit groups such as Chicago Women in Trades from doing any work at all.\n“Diversity is not illegal. Equity is not illegal. Inclusion is not illegal,” the lawsuit says. “Diversity, equity, and inclusion are aspirational ideals that have for centuries been fundamental to our progress as a nation. Efforts to promote them do not violate federal civil rights laws.”\nA White House representative, in an email to CNBC, said, “Protecting the civil rights and expanding opportunities for all Americans is a key priority of the Trump Administration, which is why he took decisive actions to terminate unlawful DEI preferences in the federal government.”\n“Every man and woman in this great country should have the opportunity to go as far as their hard work, individual initiative, and competence can take them,” the representative said. “In America, grit, excellence, and perseverance are our strengths.”\nAttorney Jessica Stender, the policy director and deputy legal director for legal nonprofit Equal Rights Advocates , pushed back against the idea that DEI policies are unlawful.\n“This notion that DEI is illegal is really a false narrative, when it’s really intended to ensure underrepresented groups have the opportunities of everyone else,” she said.\n‘The price of the paycheck’ Stender called harassment “the price of the paycheck” for women in trades. She told CNBC that some women “choose to put up with the harassment and discrimination” to attain the economic stability and benefits these jobs offer.\nVasey said her job as an electrician helped her support her family, buy a house, build a retirement fund, and maintain the economic stability to eventually attend law school.\nKelly McClellen Kelly McClellen Kelly McClellen, an operating engineer in Kansas for 28 years, told CNBC that even though she excelled at woodworking in high school, no one advised her to seek out jobs in construction.\n“I had to find the career myself,” she said, adding that getting a construction job allowed her to provide for her child as a young single mother.\nMcClellen, who co-founded Heartland Women in Trades , a nonprofit that supports tradeswomen with the help of federal grants, said she hasn’t seen a lot of change in her area when it comes to letting girls know about these opportunities.\n“We’re not educating the public about these good jobs — and that women are really good at these jobs,” she said.\nConditions for women in the trades have changed since she began her career, but not nearly enough, McClellan said.\nShe emphasized that workplace culture can be unfair for women in ways other than overt harassment. She said she had one boss who didn’t give her overtime hours, saying it was because, as a woman, she wasn’t the main breadwinner of her household. McClellen was married at the time and said her boss assumed her husband made more money than she did.\nVellinga, too, said women face barriers in the trades beyond harassment, right from the beginning.\nThey are less likely to know about opportunities, consider themselves eligible and receive mentorship, she said.\nWomen who are perceived to be “DEI hires” on worksites are given menial tasks and treated as if they are unqualified, which stymies their progress, she said.\n“It is jarring to hear some of this talk about how just because someone is a woman or a person of color they are automatically less qualified than the white male applicant that didn’t get the job,” Vellinga said.\n“But our experience has always been that women have to be more, not less, qualified in order to get opportunities in this industry,” she said.",

    "text": "Five days before an off-duty CHP motorcycle officer hit and killed a pedestrian in Long Beach, he went to a hospital emergency room complaining of distorted vision in one eye, according to newly retrieved medical records.\nNow-former Officer Alfredo Gutierrez’s medical condition was not known by prosecutors or jurors during his misdemeanor trial in May for the 2019 death of 24-year-old Cezannie Mount.\nGutierrez, who hit Mount while riding to work at 4:40 a.m., was charged with misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter because he was traveling at nearly 70 mph in a 40-mph zone.The trial ended in a hung jury, and the Long Beach City Prosecutor’s Office announced it would not seek a retrial , partially to spare Mount’s family from another protracted proceeding.\nLong Beach City Prosecutor Doug Haubert said his office would have introduced Gutierrez’s eye condition as evidence if prosecutors had known about it.\n“It could have been highly relevant to our case because driving at high speeds in the dark is dangerous enough by itself, but having an eye condition, if that is true, could have convinced a jury that what he did was reckless,” Haubert said.\nPartial emergency room records viewed by the Southern California News Group show Gutierrez was treated at UC Irvine Medical Center in the early hours of Oct. 22, 2019, for central serous chorioretinopathy, a condition that distorts vision because of a build-up of fluids beneath the retina.\nGutierrez had complained in the emergency room that a “halo pattern” was affecting the vision in his left eye, according to records written by Dr. Catherine Sheils.\n“Patient says he was driving around 9 p.m. when he noticed a cloud over his central vision in the left eye,” said the emergency room report. “He states he is able to see through the cloud and the cloud only covers his central vision.”\nIn another medical visit about a month later, Gutierrez said the condition had persisted, records show.\nLess than a week after Gutierrez’s first emergency room visit, his motorcycle fatally struck Mount. The young Long Beach man was crossing Del Amo Boulevard near Cherry Avenue outside of a crosswalk, on Oct 27, 2019, on the officer’s left side — the same side as Gutierrez’s ailing eye.\n“This officer had no business being on a motorcycle,” said Annee Della Donna, an attorney representing Mount’s family in a lawsuit against Gutierrez and the California Highway Patrol. “If you can’t see, you shouldn’t be in a car, much less on a motorcycle.”\nMount played basketball at Long Beach Poly High School and was an aspiring hip-hop artist, his family has said. After earning a degree in music from Earlham College in Indiana, he had returned home and was working at Raising Cane’s in Lakewood to pay for studio time to make music.\nDella Donna and attorney Eric Dubin discovered the medical records while investigating the lawsuit. They contend Gutierrez did not report his medical condition to prosecutors or civil attorneys. It is unclear whether CHP supervisors knew of his condition at the time of the accident.\nThe CHP, which declined to comment because of the pending litigation, conducted the accident investigation, although it occurred outside its jurisdiction in the city of Long Beach.\nGutierrez, who worked out of the South Los Angeles CHP office serving the South Bay and Long Beach, sustained serious injuries in the crash and took a medical retirement. Whether he was fit to drive a motorcycle when he hit Mount is up for contention.\nDr. Sunir Garg, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and a professor of ophthalmology at the Retina Service of Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia, said people with central serous chorioretinopathy often can still read a DMV eye chart.\nRelated Articles News | Political ‘swatting’ incidents may prompt heavier penatlies News | Ex-student found competent to stand trial for stabbing deaths near UC Davis News | Gypsy Rose Blanchard freed years after persuading boyfriend to kill abusive mother News | A skull found near Lake Tahoe has finally been linked to a nurse who disappeared in 1970 News | Pro-Palestinian demonstrators arrested at LAX entrance “Most folks with CSR may qualify for a license even though they may not be comfortable behind the wheel,” said Garg, adding that cases should be considered on an individual basis. “People (with CSR) can often read the lines on the eye chart very well, even though it looks really screwy.”\nHe likened chorioretinopathy to the vision someone would have if grease was smeared on their eyeglasses.\n“CSR generally is not going to have profound vision impairment,” and the condition generally goes away in two to three months, Garg said.",

    "text": "France's right-dominated Senate has backed a bill to ban religious symbols including the Muslim headscarf in all sport competitions, professional and amateur, sparking accusations of discrimination from the left and rights advocates.\nThe bill still needs a majority of votes from the lower-house National Assembly to become law, but the right-leaning government has thrown its weight behind the measure.\nCritics see the headscarf worn by some Muslim women as a symbol of creeping Islamisation after deadly jihadist attacks in France, while others say they are just practising their religion and should wear what they want.\nUnder France's brand of secularism, civil servants, teachers and pupils cannot wear any obvious religious symbols such as a Christian cross, Jewish kippa, Sikh turban or Muslim headscarf, also known as a hijab.\nWhile such a sweeping ban does not yet exist across all sports in France, several federations have already prohibited religious clothing including in football and basketball.\nThe upper-house Senate on Tuesday evening voted 210 to 81 to ban \"the wearing of any sign or outfit ostensibly showing a political or religious affiliation\" in competitions at regional and national level organised by all the country's sports federations.\nThe draft law also bans outfits that might \"contravene\" principles of French secularism in France's swimming pools.",

    "text": "Minority Christians in India continue to face threats and harassment as hardline Hindu groups push for a Hindu-centric cultural and religious nationalism Updated: February 23, 2024 11:26 AM GMT A Catholic school in the northeast Indian state of Assam has sought [police protection after it was threatened by Hindu extremists](https://www.ucanews.com/news/indian-catholic-school-seeks-protection-from-hostile-hindu-groups/104187) with dire consequences if Christian religious symbols from its premises were not removed within a week. A poster with the warning was found pasted on the wall of Carmel School in Jorhat run by Apostolic Carmel nuns. Church-run institutions in Assam are credited for offering education to all communities, especially poor tribal people. Christian leaders say threats against the community from hardline groups increased alarmingly in the entire northeast region covering seven states. Hardline groups have been pushing for Hindu-centric cultural nationalism for years. In early February, a hardline group asked Christian schools to remove religious symbols such as photographs, portraits, or statues of Jesus and Mary from school premises within two weeks. It also asked Catholic priests, nuns, and religious brothers not to wear cassocks and habits in schools. A supporter of India's pro-Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party wears a mask of Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a political rally in northeast Assam state on March 30, 2019. Christian leaders say threats to Church-run institutions in the state are growing with Hindu groups pushing their brand of cultural nationalism. (Photo: AFP) Rights group, Human Rights Focus Pakistan, has expressed concerns over the [safety of a Christian man falsely accused of committing blasphemy](https://www.ucanews.com/news/safety-fears-for-innocent-blasphemy-accused-in-pakistan/104202). The group issued a statement on Tuesday demanding protection and justice for Younas Masih and his family. 68-year-old Masih was accused of blasphemy after allegedly defiling a Quran in the Khurrianwala area of Faisalabad in Punjab province on Feb. 10. The group investigated the case and found the accusation by a Muslim couple was fake. It stemmed from a personal grudge and dispute between the two families. Christians protest in Karachi, in Pakistan on Aug. 19, 2023 three days after churches were attacked and vandalized by a Muslim mob in Jaranwala, in Punjab province. (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) Masih was arrested after a case was filed, but he was later released after police found the charges baseless. However, a mob followed Masih to the police station and demonstrated outside it. He and his family went into hiding fearing mob attacks. Blasphemy is a serious criminal offense in Pakistan that warrants life and death sentences. Rights groups say the controversial law is often exploited to target religious minorities including Christians. Four top Buddhist prelates in Sri Lanka have [criticized a government plan to sell key state-owned enterprises to foreign entities](https://www.ucanews.com/news/top-buddhist-monks-slam-sri-lankan-govts-privatization-plan/104198). They warned the move could trigger social, economic, and political instability in the island nation. The government of President Ranil Wickremesinghe is aiming to raise 3 to 4 biillion US dollar via the sale of some state-owned enterprises to boost foreign reserves, accelerate economic growth, and address the ongoing economic crisis. Ceylon Electricity Board trade union activists hold placards during a protest in Colombo on Nov. 1, 2023, to condemn a hike in electricity tariffs, taxes and moves to restructure the state-owned electricity utility. (Photo: AFP) Opposition parties and trade unions have opposed the plan. In a letter to the president last Sunday, four chief Buddhist prelates warned that selling state institutions including Sri Lanka Telecom and the Ceylon Electricity Board under the guise of restructuring “could harm public welfare and national security.” Rights activists called the proposed sell-off a “dangerous decision.” Sri Lanka is struggling to recover from the worst economic crisis in its history that triggered massive nationwide protests in 2022. Church officials and activists in Indonesia called for changes in election rules as the [election officials were not able to overcome fatigue](https://www.ucanews.com/news/calls-for-poll-norm-changes-after-94-officials-die-in-indonesia/104220) following the recent general election. The Indonesian health ministry said 84 officials died while 4,567 persons needed medical treatment in eight days following the election held on a single day across the archipelago nation. More than 200 million Indonesians flocked to polling stations to choose a new president and vice president, a parliament, and lawmakers among 20,000 administrative posts. More than 10,000 candidates from 18 parties contested in the 580-member national parliament. Poll officers in East Nusa Tenggara province count votes after the Feb. 14 elections. (Photo: supplied) Each voter had to cast five ballots to mark his choice. Reports say the polls were clubbed together to save the nation’s money. Indonesia’s election norms require vote recapitulation to be completed within 12 hours after elections and can be extended for another 12 hours in case of emergency. Some 500 poll officials had died after the previous election held in 2019. Catholic experts in South Korea called on the Catholic Church to consider the possibility of changing to a [hybrid church that utilizes both online and offline services](https://www.ucanews.com/news/korean-church-asked-to-become-hybrid-in-post-covid-times/104205) in a post-COVID situation. The suggestion was made in a Pastoral White Paper of the Catholic Church in Korea by the Korean Catholic Pastoral Institute of the national bishops' conference. The paper was published based on a survey, which aimed to understand the changes and perceptions among Catholics after the Covid-19 pandemic. Pastors wearing face masks sit among empty benches during an online Christmas service at the Yoido Full Gospel Church in Seoul on Dec. 25, 2020, amid precautions due to the Covid-19 coronavirus. (Photo: AFP) Several experts jointly wrote the white paper, each composing sections of it on religion, liturgy, theology, and pastoral care. South Korea had around 30.6 million Covid-19 cases and 34,093 deaths due to the virus. Korean Church reported a significant drop in church attendance following the pandemic and a consequent decline in public participation in Church activities. Philippine Catholic Church’s social service arm Caritas has expressed [doubts over the land reform program](https://www.ucanews.com/news/caritas-philippines-skeptical-on-agricultural-land-handouts/104218) of President Marcos administration that promises to redistribute private and public agricultural land to landless tillers. Marcos pledged to implement the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program to redistribute agricultural land last year, but farmers continue to till their land as tenants, not as owners, said Caritas Philippines’ head of communication and partnership development Jing Rey Henderson. Farmers protest outside the Department of Agrarian Reform office in Manila on Feb. 19. (Photo: Jimmy Domingo) The remarks came as hundreds of landless farmers from Negros Occidental in the western Visayas region and Batangas in the southwestern part of northern Luzon Island have been protesting outside the Department of Agrarian Reform headquarters in the capital Manila since Monday. The protesters demand the immediate distribution of agricultural land as promised by the president. Farmer groups say over 5,00,000 hectares of private agricultural land is to be distributed and a failure to do so would bar the nation from achieving food sufficiency. [Hong Kong government has slammed UK-based advocacy group Hong Kong Watch](https://www.ucanews.com/news/hk-dismisses-global-criticism-against-new-security-law/104215) and dozens of other activist groups who expressed grave concerns that an impending new security law would bring “further devastating consequences” for human rights in the city. In a statement on Tuesday, the Hong Kong administration said the groups had made “skewed remarks” that the authorities were undermining human rights with the upcoming enactment of legislation. The new, homegrown security law under Article 23 of the city’s mini constitution seeks to criminalize seven types of acts including treason and secession. Men walk near a national security law poster in Hong Kong. (Photo: Government of Hong Kong via HKFP) The joint statement said the proposed provisions in the legislation were vague and would result in criminalizing of free expression. The law is separate from the National Security Law imposed by Beijing in 2020 in response to a massive pro-democracy movement that erupted in 2019. The law has been used to suppress all forms of dissent by arresting and jailing hundreds of pro-democracy protesters and supporters and effectively cut off a higher degree of autonomy, basic rights, and freedoms for Hong Kong. The Vatican envoy in Timor Leste has lauded the \"excellent preparation\" by the government for a “possible” [visit by Pope Francis in August](https://www.ucanews.com/news/timor-leste-preparing-well-for-papal-visit-vatican-envoy/104174). Monsignor Marco Sprizzi, the charge d’affaires at the Apostolic Nunciature in Timor Leste, made the remarks while speaking to the reporters on the second week of February after a meeting with Timorese President José Ramos-Horta at the Presidential Palace in Dili. In the last week of January, a Vatican delegation visited Timor Leste to inspect the locations where Pope Francis is expected to visit and held meetings with Timorese authorities. Pope Francis waves to people in this undated image. The pope is expected to visit Timor-Leste in August. (Photo: AFP) Pope Francis will be the second pope to visit Timor Leste after Pope John Paul II who visited the country in 1989. About 97 percent of about 1.4 million Timorese people identify as Catholics and are spread into the Archdiocese of Dili, and the dioceses of Baucau and Maliana. About 42 percent of people live in poverty amid a lack of education and employment despite the nation being rich in mineral resources like gas and oil. Two global rights groups have called on the Cambodian government to [dismiss a politically motivated defamation lawsuit](https://www.ucanews.com/news/cambodia-urged-to-drop-lawsuit-against-rights-activist/104191) against top human rights defender Soeng Senkaruna. In a joint statement last Sunday, the Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development and CIVICUS said the complaint against Senkaruna was brought by Hun Sen, the former Cambodian prime minister and leader of the ruling CPP or Cambodian People’s Party. Cambodian human rights activist Soeng Senkaruna speaks during a seminar in this undated image. Senkaruna is facing a defamation charge brought by former Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen. (Photo: FORUM-ASIA) Hun Sen accused the activist of dishonoring the CPP following the publication of an article on the Cambodia Daily Khmer online news site. The article quoted Senkaruna as saying that the CPP has often used the country’s judiciary to intimidate the opposition and that political disputes should be resolved politically rather than through courts. Besides lengthy jail terms, state lawyers have also demanded about US$ 500,000 in compensation. Rights groups say civic space shrank sharply in Cambodia under Hun Sen's regime which deployed judicial harassment, threats, and online harassment against political opponents, non-governmental organizations, and dissenting voices. This has continued under the rule of the current premier and Hun Sen’s son, Hun Manet.

    "text": "(WLUK) -- The owner of Minocqua Brewing Company filed a complaint to ban former President Donald Trump from being on Wisconsin's 2024 primary ballot. Kirk Bangstad, of Madison, [filed the complaint with the Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC)](https://mailchi.mp/minocquabrewingcompany.com/6om0lhhnph-7909438?e=19c38d3cdd) Thursday. Similar efforts have been made in other states, including Colorado, [Maine](https://fox11online.com/news/nation-world/maine-group-attempts-keep-former-president-donald-trump-off-primary-ballot-secretary-state-constitution-capitol-insurrection#), Michigan and Virginia, which cite section 3 in the 14th Amendment disqualifies Trump from becoming president again. The clause says candidates can be disqualified from holding office if they “engaged in insurrection or rebellion.\" [Colorado’s Supreme Court ruled the ](https://fox11online.com/news/nation-world/former-president-donald-trump-cannot-appear-on-colorados-ballot-for-2024-election-ineligible-for-the-white-house-constitutions-insurrection-clause#)former president's role on January 6th and efforts to overturn the election, amount to insurrection and essentially make him ineligible.

The complaint filed by Bangstad, reads: Despite the President being the highest-ranking government official in the United States and arguably the most important head of state in the world, there are only four Constitutional requirements that a candidate must meet to serve as President of the United States of America. They must be a natural born citizen, have lived in the United States for at least 14 years, be over the age of 35 and have never engaged in an insurrection after having previously taken an oath of office. Donald J. Trump fails to meet those requirements and may not serve as President of the United States of America The filing with the WEC is the first step in a process to bar former President Trump from the Wisconsin ballot. It is anticipated that the matter will end up in state court, but has to first go through the WEC process.",

    "text": "I can hear her footsteps coming down the hallway, the great uncheatening is here.Is he afraid of meeting Novak? That can’t be true! Surely somebody will step in and make sure readers aren’t cheated\nI'm just disgusted. It's so obvious for years now what is he doing.Is he afraid of meeting Novak? That can’t be true! Surely somebody will step in and make sure readers aren’t cheated\nIt's not guys on this forum he should be compared with38 years of age, body still looking better than 95% of the guys from this forum.\nI hope he plays, match against Novak would be epic and I would enjoy every single moment of it, no matter the winner. If he decides to pull out of Olympics, I can understand that decision would be only due to some injury. I cheer for Rafael Nadal.\n38 years of age, body still looking better than 95% of the guys from this forum.\nI hope he plays, match against Novak would be epic and I would enjoy every single moment of it, no matter the winner.

That can’t be true! Surely somebody will step in and make sure readers aren’t cheated\nPlease, I didn't expect this comment from you.\nThe rumors suggest he has felt pain in the right thigh, which is the reason why he skipped the practice with Zverev.\nIf he were to skip the Olympics due to injury, you're the last person I'd expect childlishly saying \"hE's ScArEd Of NoVaK\".\nThat would be unclassy, and I know you're better than that. It'd be like mocking Novak when he skipped RG saying \"hE's ScArEd Of AlCaRaz\".\nThis is why I said playing Bastad was dumb. He should've gone all in on doubles prep instead of killing himself just to try to win a 250 in singles with the Olympics right around the corner.\nHe needed match play. He barely played in like a year and half.This is why I said playing Bastad was dumb.

It'd be like mocking Novak when he skipped RG saying \"hE's ScArEd Of AlCaRaz\".\nHe also started practicing after just 24 hours when he was already spent in the final. Dumb move tbh. He needed to rest 2-3 days.He seemed fine in Bastad?\nIt would be a shame if he can't make it\nHe shouldn't even play Olympic singles. He just needs doubles practice.Playing bastad was never dumb if he wants to play the Olympics, he needs practice, he cannot just rest for 2 months and then waltz into the olympics directly. If he wants to compete then he would like to be competitive obviously.\nAssuming he really is injured, he would be silly to compete in the singles, perhaps the doubles as he and Carlos would be a big attraction.\nThe Tennis Letter\n[https://x.com/TheTennisLetter]\n[@TheTennisLetter]\nCarlos Moya says Rafa Nadal suffered a ‘setback’ in practice yesterday & has been dealing with a thigh issue, he can’t guarantee he will compete in the Olympics “I can’t assure you Nadal will play.” “Today it was decided to rest to give him more time to recover from the setback that occurred yesterday. Let’s see if he can be ready tomorrow.” “The most responsible thing right now with an event of this magnitude is not to force it”\nWhy are you offended? It's obvious that only after draw he \"got tight\". And so he can play doubles and not singles? Are we all dum or what? And he played for hours only few days ago, said no problems. Yeah, I guess we are stupid and will swallow this crap (if really happens)...Please, I didn't expect this comment from you.\nThe rumors suggest he has felt pain in the right thigh, which is the reason why he skipped the practice with Zverev.\nIf he were to skip the Olympics due to injury, you're the last person I'd expect childlishly saying \"hE's ScArEd Of NoVaK\".\nThat would be unclassy, and I know you're better than that.

Dumb move tbh. He needed to rest 2-3 days.\nGlad you drew that conclusion, slayYeah, you better than him, he only plays tennis whole life...\nIts as if Team Nadal read my earlier thread...Let’s wait and see either way. It’s not like he was ever winning gold but I hope he plays.\nPerhaps, but he should have withdrawn in Sweden after that 4-hour match, as a winnerHe needed match play. He barely played in like a year and half.\nHe shouldn't even play Olympic singles. He just needs doubles practice.\nIts nothing to do with Djokovic lol. Nadal has never said he plans to retire this year, and the USO is round the corner. Plus, like i have said on other threads, there will be more players getting 'injured', these Olympics are not that pleasant to be in!Nadal is reluctant to Meet Djokovic without being in shape to go toe to toe because he doesn't wanna be outclassed completely and that be the last memory of his fans against his rival Novak.\nand who would blame him anyways? Djokovic is still making wimbledon final, he is in that good shape compared to anyone of 1980s gen like Nadal/Monfils/Stan/Murray/retired Roger.... So it won't be pleasant to face Novak because you will be up against a top player in the world, it is as deadly as facing zverev/med/anyone out there, Novak at this point is only below Alcaraz and possibly Sinner too. His conditioning is far better than Nadal even with his kneecap on... So Nadal is definitely reluctant.\nJoke backfired there mate lol.I’m just having fun at the expense of some expert uncheaterers\nIts nothing to do with Djokovic lol. Nadal has never said he plans to retire this year, and the USO is round the corner. Plus, like i have said on other threads, there will be more players getting 'injured', these Olympics are not that pleasant to be in!\nThen doubles is also useless, why is he even playing olympics\nBecause he has a chance to medal in Doubles. He barely has to move for Doubles.\nIt is his last medal opportunity. I don't care about Doubles but to him a medal is a medal.\n38 years old and constantly getting injured after tough matches.Who has ever beaten him at Roland Garros? Nobody! We can throw out the Zed match.\nOnly Djoker and Soderling. And he avenged those losses. To our mind Rafa is essentially undefeated at Roland Garros.\nThe King Of Clay is always a threat until proven otherwise.\nWhat part of 100-2 do people not understand?\nHmm yes, I didnt think of that... who is his partner? Alcaraz ?\nHe can def win a medal...\nUtter nonsense. Both dont back down from a fight, never have never will. People assumed Nadal was retiring, he never said he was this season.It has everything to do with Djokovic, he is facing him in round 2 and he doesn't think he will be able to play into form.... he prob would not have skipped if Djoker was on the other draw.\nThese guys don't like to face each other without being in a shape to compete to have a chance, they might as well lose to random people than take free losses. Nadal would have taken a L if he felt he had a small chance of winning but in this case he meets in R2 and he feels no shot at all...\nThis story broke after my threadApparently Nadal is confirmed for doubles and doubtful only for singles:\nHe's never been shy about strategically ducking people. Reminds me of Canelo- or vice versa.Nadal is reluctant to Meet Djokovic without being in shape to go toe to toe because he doesn't wanna be outclassed completely and that be the last memory of his fans against his rival Novak.\nand who would blame him anyways?

It would be fantastic to watch him play Djokovic in R2. What a treat for the fans of tennis, no?\nHopefully he won't withdraw from the singles event.
