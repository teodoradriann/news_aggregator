    "title": "Inflation has cost Georgia families $27,000 since 2021 | Georgia | thecentersquare.com",
    "text": "(The Center Square) – Republican lawmakers in Georgia are concerned about increases in inflation, as a recent report shows households have paid $27,427 more because of inflation since January 2021. The average household in the state is spending $1,074 more per month to buy the same goods and services as in 2021, according to a July report from the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee. To have the same standard of living as in 2021, a family in Georgia is spending $175 more per month. “At this rate, the only thing growing faster than my grocery bill is my disappointment. #kamalanomics,” said U.S. Rep. Mike Collins , in response to the report. Georgia ranks 28th in the nation for increased monthly inflation costs. U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene pointed out how she believes many families are paying for those increases. “Between the first quarter of 2021 and the second quarter of 2024, credit card debt surged 48.1% while household debt – which includes mortgages and auto loans – rose by 21.6%,” she said on social media . “This path is simply unsustainable. Democrats are plunging our country into debt and making it near impossible for Americans to make ends meet.” On the other hand, Democrats from the state have been largely quiet on these economic issues. Families in the state have experienced a 22% increase in cumulative inflation since January 2021, putting Georgia 1.5% higher than the national average. Food, shelter, energy and transportation expenses are all up in Georgia. Compared to 2021, the average household in Georgia is spending, per month, $125 more on food, $265 more on shelter, $125 more on energy, and $277 more on transportation. In the past year, just like in other states , shelter saw the biggest increase at $57 more per month. U.S. Rep. Rich McCormick said it is Democratic policies leading to these increases. “While progressive Democrats gaslight Americans into believing that Bidenomics is working, Americans are still paying more for gas, groceries, and rent due to soaring inflation,” McCormick said on social media . “The numbers speak for themselves and progressive Democrats own this CRISIS.”",

    "title": "Fiji Accepts Second Guardian Patrol Boat From Australia",
    "text": "Canberra has delivered the second Guardian-class patrol boat to Fiji as part of the Australian government’s Pacific Maritime Security Program (PMSP). The PMSP is a 30-year framework agreement costing approximately 2 billion Australian dollars ($1.3 billion) to enhance the maritime fleet, aerial surveillance, and regional coordination for Pacific Island nations and Timor-Lesté. Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka received the latest vessel, RFNS Puamau, during a handover ceremony at HMAS Stirling in Western Australia. Its arrival follows the delivery of the first Fiji Guardian patrol boat, RFNS Savenaca, to Suva in 2020. “Australia is proud to be Fiji’s security partner of choice,” Australian International Development and the Pacific Minister Pat Conroy stated. “The delivery of the second Guardian-class Patrol Boat today is a tangible demonstration of our Vuvale Partnership. By enhancing Fiji’s maritime security capabilities, we are more effective in tackling our shared regional challenges together.” Pacific Maritime Security Program According to Guardian fleet developer Austal, the Puamau is the 19th vessel handed over under the PMSP and the first of four platforms to be delivered to Australia’s partner nations this year. The company received the initial contract for the PMSP patrol boat initiative in 2016, with options for additional vessels awarded in 2018 and 2022. “Savenaca has already proven to be an invaluable addition to the Republic of Fiji Navy, undertaking successful missions throughout Fiji’s territorial waters since 2020, including combined maritime patrol and interoperability training with the Royal Australian Navy, in 2022,” Austal Limited CEO Paddy Gregg said. “I have no doubt that RFNS Puamau will further strengthen Fiji’s naval capabilities and our regional security, through effective naval operations with Australia and partnerships with other Pacific Island neighbours, as part of the Australian Government’s [PMSP].” Guardian Patrol Boats Each Guardian vessel measures 39.5 meters (139 feet) and has an 8-meter (26-foot) beam. It is powered by two Caterpillar diesel engines with 2,100 horsepower for a maximum speed of 20 knots (37 kilometers\\/23 miles per hour) and a range of 3,000 nautical miles (5,600 kilometers\\/3,500 miles). The boat can carry up to 23 personnel aboard and can be fitted with various naval weapons depending on user requirements, including a 20-millimeter main gun, 12.7-millimeter machine guns, and 20-millimeter remote weapon systems.",

    "text": "A ex-modelo Brandi Glanville contou a possível causa do \"derretimento\" de seu rosto.\nO que aconteceu A estrela de reality shows disse que a condição pode ter sido causada por um parasita. \"Eu não sei, porr*. Nós não sabemos\", disparou Glanville ao ser questionada pelo Page Six sobre as causas do problema.\nBrandi precisou fazer uma pausa nos antibióticos, mas percebeu uma nova piora e retomou o tratamento. \"Eu prefiro (meu rosto) quando está um pouco inchado, para ser honesta. Quando está inchado apenas de um lado, não é ótimo. Mas a coisa de afundar está me matando lentamente, porque eu simplesmente sinto que pareço uma viciada em crack\", lamentou.\nSakamoto\nMercado não é entidade divina e faz terrorismo\nPVC\nLibertadores não será fácil para Bahia e Corinthians\nReinaldo Azevedo\n2026 começou ontem com o dólar a R$ 6,27\nAlicia Klein\nQuer ir ao Super Mundial? Fique de olho no 'mercado'\nA ex-modelo reforçou que a principal suspeita é a do parasita, mas isso ainda não é um consenso e reforça que quer uma resposta urgente. \"Você poderia fazer qualquer coisa comigo e eu aceitaria. Eu tive dias de aparência normal, não semanas. Quem me dera. Mas isso vai e volta\", desabafou.\nNo fim de semana, só inchou no lado direito do meu rosto, então parecia que eu tinha uma almôndega muito grande no lado direito da bochecha , Brandi Glanville\nA influenciadora digital descreveu o inchaço como sendo preenchido por um \"fluido oleoso\", o que é \"nojento e muito repulsivo\".\nGlanville também diz sentir algo se movendo nesses pontos de inchaço. \"Sempre que tenho calafrios, geralmente é uma infecção. Então começo a sentir um zumbido no ouvido e, oque quer que esteja no meu rosto, se mexendo, começa a se mover novamente. E aí meu rosto começa a afundar de novo\", detalhou.\nBrandy comentou todo seu sofrimento com a situação, além da vergonha de sair em público. \"É difícil se esconder durante o Natal, quando todo mundo está fazendo suas festas. É deprimente. Isso machuca minha mente e meu coração\", confessou.\nA dor é mais mental do que qualquer outra coisa, porque tenho me escondido e passado por uma depressão profunda, muito profunda. Mesmo que eu pudesse trabalhar agora, neste momento, eu não conseguiria. Então, tem sido dois anos realmente difíceis para mim , constatou.",

    "text": "It’s another example of how openly-posted proofs of concepts are being abused to sucker security researchers.\nCredit: Shutterstock A recently copied and abused open source proof of concept (PoC) exploit from a reputable security company, aimed at helping threat researchers, is the latest example of the novel tactics hackers will use to spread malware.\nPoCs for known vulnerabilities are created to be shared by students, researchers, and IT pros to improve software and toughen defenses. The danger is that anything posted on the internet can be abused.\nCSOonline reported on the original — and safe — PoC exploit, LDAPNightmare, created by SafeBreach for a vulnerability in Windows Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) on Jan. 3. Today, however, Trend Micro said it has found a malicious version of that PoC sitting on GitHub.\nIn an interview, Tomer Bar, SafeBreach’s vice-president of security research, stressed that the company’s PoC wasn’t compromised, but was copied and manipulated. The original proof of concept exploit was published on SafeBreach’s official GitHub site.\n“We always publish full open-source” code, he added, “so people can verify that it’s valid and not malicious.”\n“The malicious repository containing the PoC appears to be a fork from the original creator,” Trend Micro said in its report. “In this case, the original Python files were replaced with the executable poc[dot]exe that was packed using UPX.”\nFortunately, the presence of an executable file in a Python-based project was a clue for experienced infosec pros that something was awry.\nA ‘classic Trojan horse’ The bad repository has since been taken down. But its discovery is another example of why anyone in IT should be careful of downloading code from anywhere, including an open source repository, said David Shipley, CEO of Canadian awareness training firm Beauceron Security.\n“Trojan’s gonna Trojan,” he said in an interview, describing the attempt to lure the unprepared as a “classic social engineering strategy.”\n“This is the classic Trojan Horse : You go looking for a legitimate, research-based PoC and you get one that looks like the PoC, but you get one with an executable.”\nThe reason why threat actors are increasingly using this tactic, he said, is because it works. Among the defences: Test the proof of concept in an isolated computer environment.\n“Any code from the web should be treated as massively unhygienic until you know it’s safe,” Shipley added.\nNot a new tactic The tactic of using a PoC to hide malware or a backdoor isn’t new. In 2023, for example, Uptycs reported on a widely-shared malicious proof of concept on GitHub purporting to address the critical Linux kernel vulnerability CVE-2023-35829. And according to a 2022 study by researchers at Cornell University into GitHub-hosted PoCs, almost 2% of the 47,285 repositories it examined had indicators of malicious intent. “This figure shows a worrying prevalence of dangerous malicious PoCs among the exploit code distributed on GitHub,” the study concluded — and that was over two years ago.\nLast fall, SonicWall released a another report on the rise of malicious PoCs . “While security researchers are often very well equipped to handle and detect this situation,” it concluded, “it is easy to become overconfident, leading to compromise.”\nOnly use trusted repositories Cybersecurity professionals, including blue and red teams, should only download content from trusted open source repositories that have a lot of stars, SafeBreach’s Bar said, and never download executables from untrusted sources.\nIn addition, Trend Micro advised IT workers to:\nalways download code, libraries, and dependencies from official and trusted repositories; be cautious of repositories with suspicious content that may seem out of place for the tool or application it is supposedly hosting; if possible, confirm the identity of the repository owner or organization; review the repository’s commit history and recent changes for anomalies or signs of malicious activity; be cautious of repositories with very few stars, forks, or contributors, especially if they claim to be widely used; look for reviews, issues, or discussions about the repository to identify potential red flags.",
