    "text": "Sídney (Australia) (EFE).- Las ballenas jorobadas que migran anualmente por la costa este de Australia fueron más felices durante el primer año de la pademia de covid-19, cuando el país oceánico aplicó estrictas medidas de confinamiento a su población, reveló un estudio científico publicado este viernes.\nLa investigación realizada por científicos de la Universidad de Queensland se apoyó en imágenes tomadas por drones y las muestras de grasa extraídas de varios ejemplares de ballenas jorobadas que transitaron en las aguas cercanas a la Isla North Stradbroke, a unos 100 kilómetros del sur de la ciudad de Brisbane.\nUQ-led research has found migrating humpback whales off Australia's east coast became less stressed over the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic 🐋\n🔗 https://t.co/JmtyDaIGLn\n📽️Jake Linsky @UQscience\n— UQ News (@UQ_News) July 5, 2024 Las imágenes permitieron observar la condición corporal y las reservas energéticas de las ballenas jorobadas (Megaptera novaeangliae) durante su larga migración anual -entre las aguas antártidas y zonas ecuatoriales a través de la costa australiana- y su intenso período de crianza.\nAsimismo, los científicos midieron genéticamente las concentraciones hormonales de la grasa (cortisol y testosterona) “durante un periodo de cambios sin precedentes en la actividad antropogénica y los procesos naturales”, según el artículo sobre este estudio publicado en la revista Marine Environment research.\nConcentraciones de cortisol significativamente más bajas El análisis de las muestras reveló concentraciones de cortisol significativamente más bajas en las ballenas estudiadas en 2021, en comparación con el año anterior.\nLas ballenas jorobadas fueron más felices durante el primer año de la pademia de covid-19. EFE/University of Queensland/Dana Cusano “Este cambio en su fisiología sugiere una disminución de los factores de estrés ambiental entre estos dos años”, dijo el autor principal de este estudio, Jake Linsky, de la Facultad de Medio Ambiente de la Universidad de Queensland, en un comunicado publicado hoy por la institución educativa australiana.\nDisminución de los contaminantes en sus remotas aguas A lo largo de 2020, se aplicaron estrictas medidas de confinamiento y restricción de movimiento en casi todo el planeta a raíz de la pandemia de la covid, mientras que a la par se iniciaba el fenómeno meteorológico de La Niña, que los científicos apuntan que también pudo tener cierta influencia en el descenso de estrés.\nLos resultados genéticos “plantean la hipótesis de que las ballenas pueden haber estado respondiendo a una disminución de los contaminantes en sus remotas aguas de alimentación”, puntualizó el científico.\nRecuperación tras la caza de ballenas En la imagen, una ballena adultas y su cría en la costa este de Australia. EFE/University of Queensland/Jake Linsky Linsky también destacó la resiliencia de esta especie que “ha logrado una de las recuperaciones más exitosas tras la caza histórica de ballenas”.\nEstudios previos ya han registrado cambios similares en las hormonas del estrés en las ballenas en el lado opuesto del continente antártico, aunque los científicos de la Universidad de Queensland sugieren que la nueva investigación podría dar cuenta de que se trató de un incidente generalizado en todo el Océano Austral.\nLa ballena jorobada, también conocida como yubarta, es un cetáceo de 40 toneladas de peso que puede llegar a medir 20 metros, con un cuerpo característico que recuerda a una joroba.\nLa población de ballenas jorobadas de Australia, que tiene dos poblaciones migratorias que navegan por sus costas oeste y este, es de 70.000 ejemplares, un número que ha ido aumentando por las medidas de protección implementadas por el país.",

    "title": "Conservative group runs $200k ad blitz blaming Rachel Morin killing on Biden policies",
    "text": "A digital ad campaign blaming the killing of Rachel Morin on President Joe Biden’s immigration policies is targeting audiences in swing states this week. The roughly $200,000 ad blitz comes as Biden prepares for his first debate this election season with former president Donald Trump, who has seized on Morin’s death to attack his Democratic opponent’s border policies. The ad campaign was bankrolled by a conservative group called “Building America Better,” which had already spent more than $724,000 this year on two ads, according to Federal Elections Commission filings. No disclosure about the most recent ad campaign had been filed with the commission Thursday afternoon. Both of those election year ads also play on fears over immigration, interspersing news reels of crimes allegedly committed by immigrants with statements from either of the presidential candidates. Morin’s killing immediately reached national attention last August after the mother of five was found dead on the Ma & Pa Trail in Bel Air. But months later, after authorities identified the suspect as a 23-year-old from El Salvador who entered the United States unlawfully, the Harford County homicide quickly became the latest center of the nationwide flareup over U.S. immigration and border policy. Thursday’s debate comes amid that flareup. Trump, who has long made inflammatory statements about immigrants , and other Republicans have targeted the Biden administration on immigration over the Morin case, claiming deficiencies have allowed criminals into the country. Democrats have responded by noting the GOP’s rejection of border enforcement measures that could have aided Biden politically during the election year. A website for Building America’s Future does not disclose much more than its other campaigns, which include a six-figure ad targeting swing states opposing the Biden administration’s proposed rules that ban menthol cigarettes. The tax-exempt group formed in 2020 named Chris Jankowski, who ran a super PAC supporting Trump’s former rival Ron DeSantis, as one of its officers in a 2023 filing to Virginia business regulators. Jankowski’s name was removed in an annual report filed Thursday morning that names several other Washington-area political strategists in its list of officers. Morin’s mother has “had a chance to view” the 60-second video that anchors the digital ad campaign but “doesn’t have any comments right now,” said Randolph Rice, an attorney who represents Patty Morin and other family members. Shortly after 23-year-old Victor Martinez-Hernandez was arrested in connection with Morin’s killing, Trump called Morin’s mother, Patty, to express his condolences. Patty said she was “deeply touched by President Trump’s kindness and concern” in an earlier statement released by the family’s attorney. Matthew McMahon, the father of Rachel Morin’s oldest daughter, said he had viewed the video and is “appalled.” “They are using Rachel to divide the country,” McMahon said, noting that he felt the video held an “underlying tone of division.” He said the video “seems to highlight to me that it is not about Rachel being murdered” but rather about the suspect, “because they wouldn’t care if it was a citizen of the U.S.” He said that Rachel’s estate — administered by his and Morin’s daughter, Faye — was not contacted by the video’s producers. “Nobody even bothered to ask Rachel’s estate how they feel about the video, or even a heads up that they were going to make it,” McMahon said. “It doesn’t sit well with me because she is being used.” When asked if he would watch the debate Thursday, McMahon said he took the time to set a reminder to make sure he doesn’t miss it because he is prepared “to watch Rachel be used” as a “campaign issue.” “This isn’t how people should be remembering Rachel because they are setting everything that was Rachel aside so they can focus on the legal status of the person that attacked her,” McMahon said, describing Morin as open, forgiving and compassionate. “Rachel was a uniter.” The digital ad blitz, which the conservative group said also includes “mobile billboards and 2D projections on famous buildings,” is anchored by a 60-second video that opens with a woman with similar characteristics to Morin walking in a wooded area. “It just keeps happening,” a female narrator says over the dramatization of Morin’s final moments. The voice mentions Laken Riley, a nursing student whose death has also become a flashpoint in the recent immigration debate. The voice in the ad says that Riley “wasn’t the first” and “in Joe Biden’s America, sadly she won’t be the last” before a gasp is heard and the footage from the woods cuts out to show news coverage of Morin’s death and Martinez-Hernandez’s arrest. The ad, which closes by calling Biden’s border policies “a nightmare for American women,” will be shown on digital platforms in seven swing states that are key to this year’s presidential election — Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Georgia, according to the group sponsoring it. The group spent more than $685,000 on a previous ad campaign focused on Riley’s killing. One of those ads uses clips of Biden in an attempt to portray him as unwilling to control the border, juxtaposing his statements with newsreels of crime coverage and Trump’s controversial words from his 2016 presidential campaign launch — that immigrants from Mexico are “bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”",

Such as Churchill, Henry VIII, Elizabeth I, Victoria, and Oliver Cromwell. What is in much shorter supply are the stories of the ordinary people who were caught up in these momentous events and whose lives were shaped by the era they lived in. Bucking this trend and recording the lives of ordinary folk who did extraordinary things is Gary Bridson-Daley with his Debt of Gratitude Project. Gary has been working non-stop as a one-man band to find and honour WW2 veterans throughout the UK, to interview them, record and publish their stories. His tireless work has produced two amazing books containing almost a hundred Army, Navy, Air Force, Special Forces, Intelligence and Home Front Civilian WW2 Veterans. A Debt of Gratitude to The Last Heroes (foreword by Dame Vera Lynn) and The Last Stand - Memories of War (foreword by The Last British Dambuster George 'Johnny' Johnson) that was published in May this year and has now also just been released in December in two 'Special Edition' formats which contain a new D-Day and Arnhem Veteran in time for next year's big 80th Anniversaries and 10,000 words more and additional pictures and illustrations.

The special editions are in black-and-white and colour and are highly recommended gifts for anyone at any time who has an interest in World War Two, UK History, history in general and most importantly the ordinary unsung folk who made our history.

I first met the impressive Gary Bridson-Daly as he embarked on this vital project and have kept in touch ever since. On a recant catch up he told me: \"My work to capture the precious stories of our dwindling World War Two generation as part of my 'Debt of Gratitude Project' still continues, its principle aims being to find, record and capture the vitally important historical testimonies of a generation who very sadly will soon disappear over the horizon of human history, and by being one the few recording as many of these stories as possible to save them for this and future generations, by getting into the public domain through the books I write and feature them in, I feel I am passionately pursuing something very important that can and will benefit many people both now and in the future! I have now been running my 'Debt of Gratitude Project' for nearly a decade, and have personally funded every aspect of it myself, having used all my savings to do so, having to pay for transport, accommodation, food, and all other related costs in order to reach and be with the Veterans all over the country so that I can personally conduct the interviews and get these gems of stories in little time we have left. I have done over 150 already but have now exhausted all my financial means to continue doing this, and with other interviews lined up I desperately need help with funding to reach these people before it's too late and we lose their stories forever which is why I have launched my GoFundMe Appeal! Any and All help is greatly appreciated.\" Gary is local lad, Manchester born, now living in Salford who has written his books here in the North-West and has interviewed a lot of local WW2 Veterans from greater Manchester who are included in both books! I urge you to give what support you can to this wonderful project to enable Gary to keep going as our WW2 Veterans are passing at an alarming rate.
