    "text": "(The Center Square) – Thousands of Amazon workers in the U.S. and abroad are striking from Black Friday to Cyber Monday. Workers have participated in the annual strike for five straight years as part of the “Make Amazon Pay” movement. TRUMP’S ‘NO TAXES ON OVERTIME’ PROPOSAL: WHAT TO KNOW Spearheaded by UNI Global Union and Progressive International, the protests include street demonstrations of Amazon workers, unions, and civil society groups in more than 30 countries, including the U.S., Germany, Brazil and Japan. The participants are demanding increased wages and better working conditions, saying they aim to “hold Amazon accountable for labour abuses, environmental degradation and threats to democracy.” HOW KAMALA HARRIS PLOWED THROUGH $1 BILLION “Amazon’s relentless pursuit of profit comes at a cost to workers, the environment and democracy,” General Secretary of UNI Global Union Christy Hoffman said this week in a press release. “Bezos’s company has spent untold millions to stop workers from organizing, but the strikes and protests happening around the world show that workers’ desire for justice–for union representation–can’t be stopped. “We stand united in demanding that Amazon treat its workers fairly, respect fundamental rights, and stop undermining the systems meant to protect us all,” she continued. “‘Make Amazon Pay Day’ is becoming a global act of resistance against Amazon’s abuse of power.” As of Sept. 30, the average pay for customer fulfillment and operations roles at Amazon is approximately $22 per hour , with benefits available. The company says it also invested $2.2 billion in 2024 to increase wages and benefits, equivalent to a $3,000 average annual increase for full-time employees. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER In a statement to multiple news outlets, Amazon accused the strike organizers of being “intentionally misleading” and spreading a “false narrative” about the company’s working conditions. “The fact is, at Amazon we provide great pay, great benefits, and great opportunities — all from day one,” Amazon spokesperson Eileen Hards said. “We’ve created more than 1.5 million jobs around the world, and counting, and we provide a modern, safe, and engaging workplace whether you work in an office or at one of our operations buildings.”",

The loss extends the Bats' losing streak to a season-high 11 games.\nFollowing a 45-minute rain delay, Louisville got off to a quick start. Jacob Hurtubise and Blake Dunn knocked back-to-back doubles against Indians starter Thomas Harrington (W, 3-1) to kick off the top of the first. A sacrifice fly from Levi Jordan put the Bats on the board, and an RBI single from David Wendzel strengthened an early Louisville lead at 2-0.\nIndianapolis fought back, taking advantage of a two-run homer in both the first and second innings from Jack Suwiniski and Matt Gorski respectively. The Indians rally doubled Louisville's score, putting Indianapolis ahead 4-2.\nIn the top of the third, the Bats combined a leadoff walk to Dunn, a base hit single from Jordan, and a double from Wendzel to even up the tally at 4-4.\nThe Indians reclaimed the lead in the bottom half of the frame thanks to a couple of walks and singles, racking the score up to 6-4. Following several quiet innings, Indianapolis launched into another scoring burst, driving in four more runs and setting the Bats at a 10-4 disadvantage going into the final innings of the game.\nLouisville rallied in the top of the eighth, starting with a leadoff walk to Edwin Ríos. Wendzel then doubled and P.J. Higgins brough in a run on an RBI groundout, cutting the Indians' lead in half and making it 10-5.\nIvan Johnson smacked a 351-foot home run in the top of the ninth, but Louisville ultimately dropped their fourth game in a row against Indianapolis with a final score of 10-6.\nBats starter Connor Overton tossed 2.2 innings, allowing four runs on four hits with two strikeouts. Coming on in the third, Patrick Weigel (L, 0-1) gave up two earned runs and claimed the loss, his first of the season. Wendzel ended the night three for four with three RBIs, and Levi Jordan also went two-for-three with an RBI.\nThe Bats (57-71, 19-35 second half) and Indians (63-63, 30-23 second half) will play the next game in the series tomorrow, Friday, August 30. With the first pitch at Victory Field set for 7:05 p.m., Nick Curran will be on the call for 1450/96.1 WXVW.\nLouisville Bats Statistics\n• Discuss this story on the\nInternational League message board...\nInternational League Stories from August 29, 2024\nBats Score Early But Fall Short 10-6 to Indians- Louisville Bats Seven-Run 10th Inning Sinks Jacksonville in 12-7 Loss to Norfolk- Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp Bats Score Early but Fall Short 10-6 to Indians- Louisville Bats Basallo Hits First Triple-A Homer In Extra Innings Win- Norfolk Tides I-Cubs Blown out in Weather-Shortened Contest- Iowa Cubs Gorski Slugs Indians to Record-Setting 10th Consecutive Win at Victory Field- Indianapolis Indians Stripers' Comeback Bid Falls Short Once Again in 5-4 Loss to Columbus- Gwinnett Stripers Rain Rests Redbirds' Rout of Rivals- Memphis Redbirds Knights Drop Thursday's Game to Sounds, 5-1- Charlotte Knights WooSox' Bats Held Dormant in 4-2 Loss to Toledo- Worcester Red Sox White, Collins Help Sounds Conquer Knights- Nashville Sounds Syracuse Pummels Lehigh Valley, 13-6, on Thursday Night- Syracuse Mets Kody Clemens Goes Deep as IronPigs Drop Second Straight to Mets- Lehigh Valley IronPigs Hens Rally Late to Claim 4-2 Victory Over Red Sox at Polar Park- Toledo Mud Hens Seymour Leads Durham to Fourth Straight- Durham Bulls Red Wings, RailRiders Postponed Thursday Night- Rochester Red Wings RailRiders and Red Wings Game Postponed- Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders August 29th Omaha Storm Chasers Game Postponed- Omaha Storm Chasers Saints and Storm Chasers Rained Out, Doubleheader Friday- St. Paul Saints August 29 Game Notes: Iowa Cubs vs. Memphis Redbirds- Iowa Cubs Trivino Scheduled to Rehab with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre- Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders Nastrini Promoted to White Sox on Thursday- Charlotte Knights SWB Game Notes - August 29- Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders Rochester Red Wings Game Notes - August 29 at Scranton/WB- Rochester Red Wings Kornberg to Broadcast Seven Additional Marlins Regular Season Games- Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp Sounds Host Braves, Cardinals Affiliates in Final Homestand of Season- Nashville Sounds Storm Chasers Drop Second Straight to St. Paul- Omaha Storm Chasers Late Offensive Charge Fizzles Out in 7-6 Loss to Columbus- Gwinnett Stripers\nThe opinions expressed in this release are those of the organization issuing it, and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of OurSports Central or its staff.",

    "text": "(TibetanReview.net, Feb14’25) – China has revised its policy on the administration of Tibetan Buddhist temples, focusing especially on Sinicization of Tibetan Buddhism with “a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation”, according to a Dharamshala-based Tibetan rights group.\nChina’s State Administration for Religious Affairs issued a revised version of its “Measures for the Administration of Tibetan Buddhist Temples” on Dec 1, 2024 – after being adopted on Sep 1 – and it came into force at the beginning of last month, said the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy Feb 14.\nIt said a major revision made in Article 4, which outlines the ideological framework within which the Communist Party of China (CPC) requires Tibetan monasteries to function, states:\n“Temples and clergy should love the motherland, support the leadership of the Communist Party of China, support the socialist system, abide by the Constitution, laws, regulations, rules, and relevant provisions on the management of religious affairs, practice core socialist values, forge a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation, adhere to the direction of the Sinicization of religion, uphold the principle of independence and self-management, safeguard national unity, ethnic unity, religious harmony, and social stability, and promote the adaptation of Tibetan Buddhism to socialist society.”\nThe group said the directive to “forge a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation” implicitly pressures Tibetan Buddhists to assimilate their distinct culture and identity into the dominant Han Chinese framework. It sees this as reinforcing China’s broader systematic policy of cultural assimilation and aligns with the CPC’s overarching goal to Sinicize Tibetan Buddhism.\nArticle 11 of the revised measure is said to compel monastic administrators to conduct political education for monks and nuns so as to ensure their loyalty to the CPC-state.\nArticle 15 is said to give the Buddhist Association of China (BAC) a prominent role in Sinicizing Tibetan Buddhism, including setting limits on the number of monks and nuns permitted to be enrolled in each temple.\nArticle 30 is said to introduce a cumbersome, multi-tiered approval process even for already registered monks and nuns when they seek to study under a teacher in another temple. After submitting an application to the temple’s management, approval has to be obtained from the township government and local Buddhist Association, which must be reviewed and certified by the county-level religious affairs bodies, before a candidate can register with the hosting temple, and everything must then be approved by the local Buddhist Association and government offices.",

    "text": "A Japanese manufacturer of industrial drones is launching a business project to use its products as a platform for detectors able find landmines “sown” in Ukraine following Russia's full-scale invasion. The company plans to make its project commercially viable as early as 2025, according to the Japanese business outlet Nikkei.\nJapanese journalists point out that Prodrone, a Nagoya-based company, will cooperate with the Tokyo consulting agency Padeco to commercialize the project. Prodrone will supply and maintain geodesic drones that can fly at a height of about 50 centimeters (20 inches) above the ground, while Padeco will be responsible for negotiations with Ukraine’s local authorities and companies. They plan to eventually transfer the development of mine detection equipment and drone operation to a Ukrainian company.\nJOIN US ON TELEGRAM\nFollow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.\nThe methodology for mine clearance is summarized as follows:\n- Its drones can detect metal objects while flying at the optimum height.\n- Artificial intelligence will determine whether the object is a landmine or other explosive object.\n- On confirmation of the nature of the object its coordinates will be recorded and this information will be transmitted to the Ukrainian government.\nProdrone says it will increase the accuracy of metal detection and improve AI, as well as establish wireless communication using satellites as part of the project.\nWhile the use of drones for mine detection in Ukraine is not new, Japanese journalists note that there are no projects operating drones at the scale envisaged by Prodrone. The Japanese company has wide experience of operating drones at the ultra-low-altitude flights that will allow the technology to successfully search for landmines.\nBiden Announces Continued Support and $7.9bn in New Aid Package for Ukraine\nSince 2022, more than 600 Ukraine civilians have been killed or injured by anti-personnel landmines and other ERW. Ukraine is already second to Syria in terms of the number of mine victims, according to statistics published by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines.\nProdrone announced the project in June and is currently working on obtaining a $400,000 grant through the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) for a pilot scheme. If the company’s testing is successful, which it expects to begin as early as November, UNIDO will consider providing up to $6.45 million to fund the full-scale project, which. Prodrone hopes will start in the 2025 and employ around 1,000 drones.\nProdrone has also been working with Padeco since April to research the use of its drones to inspect Ukraine's power grid.\n“In the future, we would like to contribute to the country's economic recovery by developing drone production as an export industry for Ukraine,” the company's CEO, Shunsuke Toya said.\nYou can also highlight the text and press Ctrl + Enter",

    "text": "Read full article Yahoo Sport Australia Emma McKeon dudded by brutal rule as fans question flag-bearer choice for Olympics opening ceremony Many have been wondering why the Aussie swimming champion didn't get the prestigious honour. sam goodwin Sports Editor Fri, 26 July 2024, 12:32 am · 5-min read Link copied\nFans have been wondering why Emma McKeon didn't get the nod to carry the Australian flag at the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics , but due to the swimming program starting the next day it was never going to happen. McKeon is Australia's most decorated Olympian and competing in her final Games in Paris, so it made complete sense for her to carry the flag in the opening ceremony.\nNo one is saying Jessica Fox and Eddie Ockenden are bad choices, but many have questioned why McKeon was overlooked. But with the swimming program beginning the day after the opening ceremony, it's highly unlikely McKeon and her teammates will attend at all.\nSome have questioned why Emma McKeon (R) isn't Australia's flag-bearer at the Olympics, after Eddie Ockenden and Jess Fox (L) got the nod. Image: Getty\nAustralia's chef de mission Anna Meares revealed this week that fewer than a quarter of the Australian athletes in Paris will actually attend the opening ceremony, with the swimmers the most likely to skip it. Meares said the opening ceremony would be an eight-hour commitment for the athletes, and with the swimming beginning straight away, McKeon and her teammates won't attend.\nHockey player Eddie Ockenden and Canoeist Jessica Fox will carry the Australian flag at the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics. (Photo by Pete Dovgan/Speed Media/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\nMeares said only about 80 athletes out of the 460-strong contingent will participate in the opening ceremony. “At the moment we’ve got approximately 200 spaces where we’ve got Australians going, we’re still looking at about 80 athletes attending and that’s probably just over 100 staff in attendance as well,” she said.\nAt past Olympics, the swimmers have held their own 'mini opening ceremony' of sorts in the athletes' village - opting to avoid being on their feet too much so they can rest up before their events. It goes to show why McKeon won't be the flag-bearer and answers the question on many peoples' lips.\nI mean I love Jess Fox but Emma McKeon is very very stiff #Paris2024\n— Nat Martin (@NatMartin30) July 24, 2024\nEmma McKeon should've been the Aussie Olympic flag bearer pic.twitter.com/5TeiqWSpbf\n— Jed Wells (@JedWells23) July 24, 2024\nI’d be picking Eddie Ockenden personally as male flag bearer\nEmma McKeon my pick for female but Lauren Jackson or Jess Fox would also be good shouts https://t.co/rWR3ZM6FRw\n— Liam (@LiamMc99) July 24, 2024\nEmma McKeon won't be at Olympics closing ceremony either The next obvious move would be to give McKeon the flag-bearer role for the closing ceremony, but a controversial rule imposed by the Australian Olympic Committee means that's highly unlikely as well. Aussie athletes will be forced to vacate the Olympic village within 48 hours of their events finishing, and with the swimming taking place in the opening week, it's unlikely McKeon will still be in Paris for the closing ceremony.\nMcKeon and the majority of the swimming team were back in Australia by the time the closing ceremony took place in Tokyo in 2021. However the veteran swimmer might opt to remain in Europe this time around if the flag-bearer role is on the cards in Paris. It would be a massive shame if McKeon misses out considering everything she's achieved in her Olympics career.\nAustralian swimmers Moesha Johnson, Emma McKeon, Kaylee McKeown and Lani Pallister at the Olympics. (Photo by Quinn Rooney/Getty Images)\nThe rule that athletes must leave within 48 hours has gone down like a lead balloon, with a raft of current and former swimmers slamming the edict. “You think of Emma McKeon and what she could achieve at the Games. But a lot of athletes won’t hang around Paris after they have finished because they cannot afford to,\" Leisel Jones told The Australian in February.\n“The swimmers only find out whether they are going to Paris five or six weeks out from the Games so it could to be impossible for them to book accommodation for the second week. Can you imagine how expensive it would be? They would have to go well outside Paris.\n“It will be devastating for them. Some of the greatest memories I have of my Games experience came in the second week. I never got to do an opening ceremony and to miss the second week would be horrendous.\"\nRELATED:\nMatildas make nightmare start at Olympics as fans blast 'awful' scenes\nAustralian team makes calls on sending coach home over shock comments\nAussie swimming stars blast Olympic village rule Aussie star Ariarne Titmus described it as a \"rip off\". She said earlier this year: “After you’ve worked so hard to go to the Olympics, to be removed from that entire environment as soon as you finish...I completely understand the reasoning behind it that you want every Olympic athlete in the Australian team to have the best possible chance to perform the best they can.\n“But not having Australian athletes in the village isn’t going to remove the noise or the partying from every other athlete in the village from around the world. The Australian swim team are the major medal winners for our country. We don’t get to go to the opening ceremony because we’re racing the first day. Now we don’t get to the closing. We literally miss out on our Olympic experience other than racing.”\nKaylee McKeown added: “It does make me mad. It makes a lot of athletes mad because we got that taken away from us because of a reason. Just let us experience an Olympic Games.”",

    "text": "A previsão de temporais no Estado do Rio de Janeiro a partir da noite desta quinta-feira, 21, levou o governador Cláudio Castro (PL) a decretar ponto facultativo na sexta-feira, 22. A medida foi anunciada no início da noite de quinta-feira, 21, quando ainda não havia chuva. O prefeito Eduardo Paes (PSD), por sua vez, publicou vídeo nas redes sociais pedindo que as pessoas evitem se deslocar pela cidade durante a noite. Ele fez \"apelo aos patrões\" para que, levando em conta a chuva, não exijam a presença de funcionários que possam trabalhar sem se deslocar. Na gravação, Paes aparece no Centro de Operações Rio (COR), de onde a cidade é monitorada por meio de câmeras. Ao lado da chefe de meteorologia do Centro, Raquel Franco, o prefeito afirmou que previsão é de chuva a partir da noite desta quinta, e que ela deve se estender pela sexta e pelo final de semana, até domingo. \"Quem tiver de fazer deslocamento pela cidade, se puder fazer mais cedo, para que, caso a chuva aconteça às 7 da noite, a gente não tenha tanta gente na rua... esse é meu primeiro pedido\", afirmou Paes. \"Faço um apelo aqui aos patrões, para evitar esse deslocamento pela cidade. Quanto mais gente tem na rua quando está chovendo, mais risco a gente tem, e mais difícil fica o trabalho dos órgãos públicos\", afirmou. Paes afirmou que vai passar a noite no Centro de Operações, acompanhando as consequências da chuva, e recomendou que os planos para o final de semana sejam caseiros: \"Não é um final de semana para ficar se deslocando por aí, (é para) aquele programa mais doméstico possível\", afirmou. Ao final da mensagem, Paes disse torcer para que a previsão de chuva esteja errada e que as falas dele gerem \"memes\" nas redes sociais. Em boletim emitido às 17h30 desta quinta, o COR informou que até então não tinha havido registro de chuva em nenhum ponto da cidade e que a temperatura máxima do dia foi de 40,6°C, registrada às 14h. A mínima foi de 24°C, à 1h10. \"Para o final da noite desta quinta e madrugada de sexta, a previsão é de pancadas de chuva moderada a muito forte, acompanhadas de raios e rajadas de vento forte. Entre o final da noite desta quinta e a tarde do sábado, a aproximação e passagem de frente fria e o posterior transporte de umidade deixarão o tempo instável na cidade do Rio\", prevê a prefeitura. \"A previsão é de pancadas de chuva moderada a muito forte a partir do final da noite de quinta, se estendendo para a madrugada de sexta, acompanhadas de raios e rajadas de vento moderado a forte (até 75,9 km/h)\", afirma o COR. \"Ao longo da sexta, a previsão é de chuva moderada de forma contínua, podendo ser muito forte a partir da tarde. No sábado e na madrugada e manhã de domingo, a chuva permanece com intensidade moderada a forte, podendo ocasionar acumulados elevados em 24h. A chuva poderá passar de 40 mm/h e 200mm/24h em pelo menos um ponto da cidade. As temperaturas estarão em declínio acentuado\", acrescenta. \"No restante do domingo e na segunda, uma área de baixa pressão no oceano manterá o céu nublado a encoberto na cidade, com previsão de chuva fraca a moderada isolada a qualquer momento\", conclui o boletim.

    "text": "LINCOLN, NEB — Lincoln district reports significant rise in graduation rates, meeting the goal of its strategic plan.\nLincoln Public Schools says graduation rates have risen by more than 3%, from 83.9% in 2023 to 87.6% in 2024.\nThe district says this reflects the goal outlined in its strategic plan of 87% on-time graduation.\nThe district uses different metrics compared to the Nebraska Department of Education, which reported in its recently released data for the 2023-24 school year that LPS has a graduation rate of 85 percent – a three percent increase from the previous school year.\n“We think of our graduation rate goal as really a K through 12 goal. We're talking to students as early as elementary school about the year they're going to graduate from high school, as they go up in their grades in middle school and high school, we're talking about career choices, different opportunities that would be exciting to them to get them passionate about what they want to do next,\" said Sarah Salem, LPS Associate Superintendent for Teaching and Learning.\nSalem attributes the increase Graduation rate to LPS staff and teachers with help prepare students for the next step like taking the ACT or thinking about college.\nWhile the graduation rate has increased, according to Nebraska Department of Education data, the college going rate for LPS during the 2023-24 school year was 73%, down 3% from the previous school year.\nLPS says they have social workers, counselors and other resources in place to help families and student who need assistants.",
