    "text": "原标题：台州法院严厉打击恶意欠薪行为快立快审快执高效保障劳动者权益\n□ 本报记者 王 春\n□ 本报通讯员 吕佳慧\n近日，《法治日报》记者走进浙江省玉环市一汽配公司园区的会议室，员工们排着队，在玉环市人民法院执行干警张绍华等人的安排下，正有序办理工资申领手续。\n“我的工资马上‘齐活’啦！”员工小刘高兴地告诉记者。\n这是玉环市人民法院在去年年底受理的一起欠薪纠纷。玉环法院启动快审快执通道，不仅保障了多名员工的合法权益，也及时挽救了岌岌可危的汽配企业。\n近年来，台州两级法院始终将保障劳动权益置于司法工作的重要位置。\n台州市中级人民法院院长翟寅生向记者介绍称，去年以来，台州两级法院进一步深化机制改革、凝聚社会合力，严厉打击恶意欠薪行为，以“快立快审快执”机制为基础，构建起劳动者权益全链条保护体系，筑牢劳动者权益“防护墙”，为营造和谐有序的用工环境、优化法治化营商环境贡献法院力量。\n开通维权绿色通道\n2024年10月，台州中院会同台州市人力资源和社会保障局共同出台《关于加强调裁审执衔接推动农民工工资争议速办工作的通知》，在调裁审执各环节落实对农民工群体涉薪资权益的保护。\n“没想到能在过节之前就要到了工资，太感谢法院了。效率真的非常高，我们可以拿这钱好好过个元旦了。”去年底，农民工老张看见工资到账的消息后，立刻打电话向仙居县人民法院承办法官戴天华“报喜”。\n一施工项目经层层分包，由仙居县某建筑劳务公司承揽了部分劳务工程。老张受雇于这家建筑劳务公司，从事脚手架搭建和拆除等工作。但工程结束后，该劳务公司却以工资应由项目发包方某建设集团支付为由，拖欠农民工工资。\n仙居法院立案庭接到老张等人的立案申请后，立刻开通农民工维权“绿色通道”，并由专人与业务庭进行对接，优先排期、优先审理，适用速裁程序进行审理，并由承办法官戴天华进行督促履行，及时高效保障了老张等农民工的合法权益。\n仙居法院对农民工讨薪案件实行优先接待、优先立案、优先送达、优先调解，并安排专人负责引导，简化立案手续，提供优质高效的“一站式”服务，全力为劳动者撑起权益“保护伞”。\n“涉农民工案件往往并不复杂，但是小案不小办，要办就办实。”仙居法院民一庭庭长吴勇智说。\n开展集中执行行动\n2025年伊始，台州中院在全市开展“执护营商——暖冬”集中执行行动，以拖欠工资案件为重点，聚焦各类涉民生案件和5万元以下小标的案件，集中解决一批群众急难愁盼问题。\n该项行动中，全市法院执结拖欠工资案件426件，执行到位2375.35万元。\n在台州市黄岩区，包工头胡某拖欠水泥工老闫1万余元工资款迟迟不付。1月9日清晨，黄岩区人民法院执行干警由老闫带路找到胡某，将其带往法院。到法院后，胡某在法官的引导下逐渐转变态度，称愿意积极凑钱付工资。最终，胡某凑齐所有执行款，案件履行完毕。\n“感谢法院为我们主持公道，让我们这些外来务工人员也能感受到法律的温暖。”领到工资后的老闫十分感动。\n同一时间，在温岭市人民法院的会议室里，职工工资执行案款集中发放活动正在开展。28名来自同一家4S店的员工在执行干警的引导下，签字确认工资金额、收款账户信息。\n这家4S店因经营不善倒闭，员工被拖欠工资后陆续向温岭法院申请强制执行。执行干警先后联系了4S店原经理、经销商、汽车生产商，最终找到了一条200余万元款项的财产线索。在汽车生产商的配合下，温岭法院将该款项作为4S店的执行款划扣到位，28名员工也顺利地领到了属于他们的工资款。\n多元化解劳动纠纷\n近年来，台州两级法院在劳动纠纷领域积极探索工作新思路，多方协同推进劳动纠纷调裁诉的衔接配合，建立劳动纠纷多元化解机制，推动构建和谐劳动关系。\n三门县人民法院主动融入党委、政府矛盾纠纷预防化解共建共治共享大格局，会同县总工会、县人社局搭建“一中心、一小组、一会议”的劳动纠纷调裁诉联合化解工作格局，向劳动纠纷调裁诉联合化解中心派驻法官，为职工群众提供“一窗受理、集中分流、分类处理、一揽子调处”的高质量、高效率调处服务。\n日前，员工刘某因工伤与三门某工程公司产生纠纷，来到三门县劳动纠纷调裁诉联合化解中心求助。该中心受理后，在法官、调解员等多方力量的努力下，刘某与该公司达成和解。公司一次性赔偿刘某伤残就业补助金等各项损失合计4.5万元。\n“多亏了他们帮忙，我才能拿到工伤赔偿。”刘某激动地说。（王 春 吕佳慧）",

    "text": "Pakistan's Caretaker PM Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar Bans New Year 2024 Celebrations, Know Why The caretaker Prime Minister of Pakistan, Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar, has declared a strict ban on all forms of New Year celebrations across the country. Trending Photos New Delhi: Pakistan has instituted a nationwide prohibition on New Year's celebrations to express solidarity with Palestine. The interim Prime Minister of Pakistan, Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar, declared a stringent ban on any New Year celebrations as a demonstration of support for Palestine and Gaza, currently engaged in conflict with Israel. In his address to the nation, Kakar called for a demonstration of unity with the Palestinians and emphasized the importance of displaying sobriety and humility in the New Year. \"In light of the deeply troubling situation in Palestine and as a gesture of solidarity with our Palestinian brethren, the government has declared a stringent prohibition on hosting any form of New Year events,\" said Kakar. \"The entire Pakistan and the Muslim world are deeply distressed by the tragedy of innocent children being massacred and the genocide of unarmed Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank,\" he added. Kakar mentioned that Pakistan has dispatched two aid packages to Palestine, with a third one in the works. He underscored Pakistan's consistent endeavors to shed light on the plight of the Palestinian people on international forums, reiterating the nation's dedication to persist in these efforts to bring an end to the violence inflicted by Israel. Israel vowed to annihilate Hamas after its fighters burst into Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages. Its air, sea and ground offensive in Gaza has since killed nearly 21,000 Palestinians, according to authorities. Live Tv",

    "text": "How Action Against Hunger CEO Onome Ako is Powering Ideas for People and Planet Published February 15, 2024 • 4 Min Read Ako’s leadership is rooted in values of equity and inclusion, inspired by her upbringing in Nigeria. Her parents’ community-focused actions ignited in her a deep sense of responsibility and a desire for systemic change. Ako immigrated to Canada in in 2008 with a drive “to do what’s right” for families and communities in need. She has been a client of RBC since her arrival, sharing that “RBC gave me a secure credit card when no one else would.” Ako’s personal experiences have been a driving force in her fight against hunger. Redefining the image of a CEO Ako was recognized as a [2023 RBC Canadian Women Entrepreneur Awards Social Change National Winner](https://www.womenofinfluence.ca/rbc-cwea/). For more than three decades, the Awards have recognized and celebrated the strides of Canada’s most accomplished, influential, and impactful women. Ako is celebrated for her impactful role in combating global hunger. When asked what it means to be recognized, she shares that it is “very humbling, because I share the space with a lot of incredible women who are having an impact in different spheres of life. It’s an incredible opportunity to showcase the work of my colleagues and the need for more resources to be put towards the hunger crisis.” She adds that the award also highlights for her seven-year-old daughter that kids like her can be who they want to be. “I’m normally the only female and only Black individual in a lot of the places I go. The picture others may have of a CEO is not me.” Tackling the relentless hunger crisis [Action Against Hunger](https://actionagainsthunger.ca/) operates in over 50 countries, with more than 8,000 employees and volunteers helping 28 million people in need. Ako joined as CEO in 2021, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and the hunger crisis had become exacerbated locally and globally. She explains her motivation for joining the organization and making hunger the cause she is dedicating her life to now: “Over 800 million people go to bed hungry every night – and in 2021, people around the world were driven more into the hunger crisis as a result of COVID,” she says. “Then when you look at the hot spots and consider where you have hunger, it’s places where you have conflict, political instability, climate change and gender inequality. We know that in the communities where we work, women eat least, and they eat last. Looking around at everything in that period, I considered it a privilege to be leading an organization that is responding to the hunger crisis.” Anchored in a clear mission, vision, and values Ako emphasizes the importance of a clear mission, vision, and set of values in guiding the organization’s operations. These principles help unite a diverse network of employees and volunteers and ensure efficient resource allocation. Ako’s leadership focuses on building a respectful, collaborative environment with a strong sense of accountability and equity. While Ako is quick to explain that while the organization had these values before she joined, by clearly and boldly articulating them, there is more intentionality and accountability to those values. Their performance appraisals are grounded in these values, and they are tracking how they are working alongside them. “I am also accountable to our values, because they have been set by the organization, not just by me,” Ako says. Overcoming challenges through awareness and education According to the [2024 Hunger Funding Gap Report](https://actionagainsthunger.ca/app/uploads/2024/01/hunger-gap-aah-report-2024-1.pdf), the global hunger funding gap has hit 65% for countries with the most urgent needs. The new analysis reveals that only 35% of appeals from countries dealing with crisis levels of hunger were fulfilled in 2023, resulting in an average hunger funding gap of 65%, up 23% from the prior year. Ako and her team address this through leadership in the hunger space, engaging with stakeholders, and highlighting the needs in crisis-stricken countries. They work closely with local communities to leverage existing knowledge and resources. She adds that RBC has been a trusted and reliable financial partner, helping her organization ensure resources reach the communities in need. “RBC plays a significant role in ensuring that we’re able to reach our goal in getting the financial resources to the partners that we need to reach in over 40 countries that we work in. We work very closely and collaboratively with our RBC partner.” Ako’s leadership approach, combining passion with clarity and accountability with empowerment, positions her as a change-maker. Her work with Action Against Hunger Canada not only addresses the immediate needs but also aims to create systemic social change, impacting generations around the world.
