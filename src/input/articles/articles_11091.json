    "text": "For singer Vasu Kainth, it is no different. Vasu addresses this issue in his upcoming song, Mai Kaisa Hu. After the positive response to the release of Roko Na, the music video of which was released last month, Vasu is now gearing up for a unique flavour and tune that can easily qualify as earworms\nIn our chat with the chanteur, we discuss the message that he is trying to get across, his struggles in the creative process, and why medley covers is a prominent trend currently.\nAaryan Banthia unveils soulful melody 'Tera Mera' - A journey of connection and unity How does Main Kaisa Hu explore and address the difficulties in the creative process for artistes?\nMain Kaisa Hu is a song that digs deep into artistes' struggles during the process of creation. It's also about anyone who feels overwhelmed by life's pressures. Through this song, I'm expressing exhaustion and the desire for solitude, hereby reflecting on my journey. It's a plea for understanding, a cry for space and autonomy in my creative process. I hope listeners can relate to the raw emotions conveyed in the song and find solace in knowing they're not alone in their struggles.\nAs an artiste yourself, what are some of the struggles you've faced?\nWhen it comes to creating music, finding the right headspace is crucial. Imagine trying to paint a picture with a cluttered mind - it just wouldn't come out right. Distractions are like roadblocks on the path to authenticity. I want my music to come from a place of honesty and truth, and that requires a clear mind and focused energy. But it's not always easy; there are days when the noise of the world seems too loud, and finding that quiet space within feels like a distant dream. Despite the challenges, I persevere, because I know that when I find that space, the music that emerges is worth every struggle.\nYou've also been making some medley covers. This is a prominent trend currently. Why do you think there's so much love for the same?\nBy blending different songs and languages, they create a unique musical experience that appeals to a wide range of listeners. It's like having a music buffet - you get to taste a little bit of everything. I find it exciting to explore different styles and genres, to push the boundaries of what's possible. Plus, medleys showcase versatility, allowing me to flex my musical muscles and show what I'm capable of.\nIndie artiste Neela opens up about the release of her upcoming song, 'Forgive' Who are some artistes that have inspired you?\nIcons like Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar, and Bruno Mars inspire me with their creativity and passion. Their journeys remind me that success doesn't come easy - it takes hard work, dedication, and a whole lot of heart. And when it comes to contemporary artistes, I'm drawn to those who aren't afraid to push the boundaries and challenge the status quo. Artistes like Post Malone and Jack Harlow remind me that there's always room for innovation, no matter how crowded the industry may seem.\nMai Kaisa Hu releases online today.",

    "title": "Why China Would Want to Launch an ICBM Out Into the Pacific - Business Insider",
    "text": "China's test of an intercontinental ballistic missile this week, which saw the country lob the long-range weapon far out into the Pacific Ocean, was a very public display of Chinese military power at a time when it is bolstering its nuclear arsenal.The test — the first of its kind by China in over 40 years — also gave China the chance to gather invaluable data about what the ICBM's launch, trajectory, and range could look like in a potential real-world scenario, something a lofted test out in the desert can't offer.On Wednesday, the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force, the missile branch of the Chinese military, fired an ICBM with a dummy warhead into the Pacific. Though it was anything but, China's Ministry of Defense said the test launch was \\\"routine.\\\" It noted it was part of the country's training plan and said other countries were notified in advance.Maps shared online indicated the weapon, which was launched from Hainan, landed in the South Pacific after covering a distance of roughly 12,000 km. China's defense ministry said that the ICBM came down where expected.China has not said which missile was tested, but the military has shared pictures online. China watchers and experts initially suggested it could've been a DF-41, one of PLARF's newer ICBMs. The three-stage, solid-fueled rocket has been tested out in the Gobi Desert and was publicly unveiled back in 2019. Other analysts have since said that the weapon was a DF-31 variant.China has conducted several ICBM tests in interior desert locations as its missile arsenal has grown, but Wednesday's test was different, providing China with something the other tests couldn't.Tianran Xu, an analyst for Open Nuclear Network, told Business Insider that \\\"if you launch towards the Pacific, that's the most realistic scenario because you can see how the rocket performs in completely realistic conditions.\\\"He said that this kind of testing likely isn't indispensable, but \\\"it does have the advantage of being completely realistic.\\\"China has long tested missiles out in the desert, but as Decker Eveleth, a researcher at the Center for Naval Analyses, noted in a series of social media posts, \\\"the problem is that this forces you to use a lofted trajectory\\\" because the \\\"distance from the ICBM test site to the target ranges is around 2000-3000 kilometers.\\\"\\\"That means, if the PLARF wanted to test a depressed trajectory, they're going to need to find another place to test their ICBMs,\\\" he said, referring to a lower, longer flight path.Chinese military analysts arrived at similar conclusions. Song Zhongping, a retired PLARF officer and commentator, told the state-run China Daily that \\\"though China's intercontinental ballistic missiles have good reliability and strong power, we need a certain number of full-range tests to check their operational readiness.\\\"The US notably conducts ICBM readiness tests regularly by launching Minuteman III ICBMs into the Pacific. These tests are fairly routine, unlike the Chinese test, which was the first such test since a DF-5 test in 1980.Tianran said that China's interior missile tests likely have given China sufficient confidence in the capabilities of its weapons, but the test in the Pacific was a rare opportunity to mimic what a real launch would look like, including logistics, transportation, the skills of missile crews, and launching from atypical sites.\\\"Launching a missile is complicated and there are a variety of tasks that if you mess it up, that missile is going to miss the target,\\\" Eveleth said. \\\"By doing it out at Hainan and launching from a potentially unfamiliar launch location the missile crew may be unfamiliar with you can identify potential pitfalls in the process.\\\"The publicly announced ICBM launch comes as PLARF expands its nuclear arsenal and builds up its missile capabilities.Last fall, the Department of Defense reported that PLARF had effectively doubled its stockpiles of some missiles from 2021 to 2022, including medium-range ballistics capable of targeting US military assets in Japan and intermediate-range missiles able to reach Guam; its number of ICBMs went from 300 to 350, while its launchers for those missiles grew from 300 to 500.The \\\"dramatic expansion,\\\" coupled with other new developments, \\\"will significantly improve its nuclear-capable missile forces and will require increased nuclear-warhead production,\\\" the Pentagon said, estimating that China has more than 500 operational nuclear warheads — making it the world's third-largest arsenal after Russia and the US.China's ICBM test in the Pacific also comes as the country flexes its muscles, conducting joint naval drills with Russia that the Russian leader characterized as a challenge to the US-led world order, bullying neighboring nations, and testing boundaries.China has faced repeated criticism for engaging in unsafe intercepts of American aircraft and those of its allies, airspace violations and breaches of territorial waters, and aggressive clashes at sea in contested waterways while also continuing to put increasing pressure on Taiwan.Beijing has likewise expressed frustration with the US military's presence in the region, including the indefinite deployment of a new missile system in the Philippines and a potential future one to Japan, among other things.A spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry recently accused the US, through its moves, of heightening an \\\"arms race\\\" and exacerbating \\\"regional tensions\\\" related to the deployment. China has also recently complained about transits by the US and its allies and partners through the Taiwan Strait.Despite the persistent tensions in the Indo-Pacific region, the Chinese military stated that its ICBM test was \\\"not directed against any country or target.\\\" It didn't say whether it plans to repeat this kind of test in the future.",

    "title": "1,200 HP 2025 Ferrari F80 Unleashed",
    "text": "On the heels of its second overall victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Ferrari has unveiled its latest top-of-the-line hypercar, the F80. Equipped with a hybrid powertrain that makes a total of 1,200 horsepower, the supercar will no doubt be the terror of lap records the world over. Unusually for the brand, the F80 is not powered by a V12 engine. Instead, it gets a twin-turbo V6 and three electric motors. But don’t be disappointed, the powertrain was inspired by the automaker’s Formula One and World Endurance Championship racecars, both of which use an electrified V6. As a result, the internal combustion engine under the hood is a beast. Pumping out 900 hp on its own, the engine has the highest specific output of any Ferrari engine ever (meaning that it is pound-for-pound the most powerful engine the legendary firm has ever developed). To make it feel like a Ferrari, the engine revs to 9,000 rpm and its turbochargers can be spun up electrically to eliminate turbo lag. The electric motors help get the F80 all the way up to the 1,200 hp mark, and two are located at the front axle. With each motor powering its own wheel, the F80 can take advantage of torque vectoring technology, which helps it through the corners. The motors cannot, however, propel the car on their own because Ferrari decided that no one would want an electric-only mode for their hypercar. Further assisting it in the twisty stuff is the active suspension. This keeps the car comfortable in the real world but perfectly flat on the track. Keeping the car level when it's going fast is especially important because the F80 uses underfloor aerodynamics, just like Ferrari’s racecars. Known as the ground effect, the technique carefully channels the air passing under the car to create suction that glues it to the track, while generating much less drag than a big over body wing. Despite that, the F80 also uses a big wing on the back of the car, but it can move around to generate less drag and downforce or more of both, depending on what the driver needs. In total, the aerodynamic setup generates a massive 1,000 kg (2,204 lbs) of downforce to help the hypercar tackle corners insanely quickly. To help drivers hit apexes with precision, the F80 is the first car to feature Ferrari’s new steering wheel, which is smaller and thinner than the brand’s other wheels, making it easier to see through. The automaker adds that the unit is also shaped to make it easier to grab without gloves. Elsewhere, the interior is inspired by Ferrari’s single-seat racers, giving it an offset 1+ seating setup, and placing the driver in a laid-back position. Ferrari plans to make just 799 examples of this special hybrid hypercar.",

Maura Healey’s administration issued a permit to the Newhouse Wildlife Rescue Thursday for Nibi, a local beaver and viral sensation, to remain at the rehabilitation center as an educational animal.\nNibi has been in the care of the Chelmsford facility for the last two years. The beaver was set to be released back into the wild this week, but caretaker Jane Newhouse said she did not have the skills to survive.\nAfter a temporary restraining order was issued on Monday, barring any removal of Nibi from the rescue center, Healey’s administration issued the permit.\nHealey said Nibi has captured the hearts of many across Massachusetts, including hers.\n“We’re excited to share that we have issued a permit for Nibi to remain in Newhouse’s care, continuing to educate the public about this important species,” Healey said in a statement. “I’m grateful to our state’s dedicated wildlife biologists who work every day to care for Massachusetts wildlife, and I hope Nibi inspires more people to protect our natural world.”\nAfter learning of the governor’s decision, MassWildlife released a statement.\n“We all care about what is best for the beaver known as Nibi and all wild animals throughout our state. Our mission is to protect and conserve the diverse species of fish and wildlife throughout Massachusetts,” MassWildlife Director Mark Tisa wrote.",
