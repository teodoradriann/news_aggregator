    "text": "NEW YORK - Bitcoin Minetrix, a company specializing in Ethereum-based cloud mining, has successfully raised over $7.5 million, signaling increasing investor confidence in the cryptocurrency sector. This fundraising comes at a time when the market is hopeful for a Bitcoin ETF approval, which is expected to propel Bitcoin's price from its current $44,000 to a potential $50,000.\nIn recent meetings, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hinted at the possibility of an ETF approval, contributing to a more optimistic market outlook. This optimism persists despite earlier price drops and significant liquidations reported by Coinglass.\nBitcoin Minetrix intends to use the majority of the raised funds to expand its mining operations and to enhance its marketing efforts. The company's cloud-mining model is designed to offer investors a way to participate in cryptocurrency mining with reduced risk, especially during periods of market volatility.\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

    "text": "As the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes an everyday practice across a range of sectors, its pitfalls in the legal fraternity have come under the spotlight in the Pietermaritzburg High Court.\nThis happened when Judge Elsja-Marie Bezuidenhout probed case law cited by a lawyer in an effort to appeal against a ruling she had made in the controversial Philani Mavundla case and found that no such cases existed.\nLegal experts have called for greater regulation of AI’s use.\nThe judge unearthed signs of AI use while looking into various cases Mavundla’s lawyers had cited in an appeal against a ruling she had made in favour of the Umvoti local council last September.\nALSO READ | [Call to adopt artificial intelligence to fight crime](https://witness.co.za/news/2023/02/16/call-to-adopt-artificial-intelligence-to-fight-crime/)\n“Of the nine cases referred to and cited, only two could be found to exist, albeit that the citation of one was incorrect,” the judge said on Thursday while delivering judgment, refusing leave to appeal.\n“While the real source of the authorities quoted remain unknown”, it was likely that the firm had relied on AI technology, which was “irresponsible and downright unprofessional”, and that Mavundla’s counsel had “blindly relied on authorities provided to her [by a clerk] without checking the references”.\nJudge Bezuidenhout has referred the matter to the Legal Practice Council (LPC) for further action.\nAt the receiving end of her indignation is local lawyer S Pillay, who works for the Pietermaritzburg law firm Surendra Singh and Associates.\n“I had serious concerns,” said Judge Bezuidenhout.\nPillay said she had been provided with the references by an “article clerk” and that she had not had sight of the cases as she was “overbooked” and under a lot of pressure.\nIt then came to light that the notice of appeal had been drafted by the clerk.\nThe clerk, explaining herself in court, said she had obtained the cases from law journals by doing research through her so-called Unisa portal, said the judge.\n“I asked her which law journals specifically and she could not respond. I asked her if she had by any chance used an Artificial Intelligence application such as ChatGPT but she denied having done so,” Judge Bezuidenhout said.\nSuren Singh, the owner of the law firm, admitted that his clerk used Google but he did not check what platforms were used.\nHe had submitted that he should not pay the costs of the two hearings as he had a “small firm” and stood by his articled clerk.\n“He did not want to admit any wrongdoing or take responsibility for how serious the actions of Pillay and [the clerk] were,” the judge said.\nSingh had suggested that the advocate for the respondent [the MEC for Department of Co-operative Government and Traditional Affairs] was equally to blame because he too had not checked the citations.\nThe judge said it was “unclear if he was conceding” that ChatGPT and other AI programmes had been used.\n“It is clear that a court should be able to assume and rely on counsel’s tacit representation that the authorities cited and relied upon do actually exist,” she said.\nHowever, the lawyer blindly relied on information provided to her [by the clerk] without checking the references.\nThe LPC told [The Witness](https://witness.co.za/) that it was still studying the ruling, to determine primarily whether there was a contravention of rules/regulations of the Legal Practitioners Act and should there be contraventions, the matter will be investigated accordingly.\nLPC spokesperson Kabelo Letebele said AI was a tool that practitioners could use in preparation for a case but they then need to apply their minds and check if the case law they use was, firstly appropriate to the case they are dealing with.\n“The LPC has conducted many workshops to legal practitioners in the country on how to access our legal library for them to check if the case law they are wanting to use is relevant. We have seen a few cases where the court picked up that the legal practitioner used AI and did not double-check its existence and relevance,” he said.\nAdvocate Mfesane Ka-Siboto agreed with the LPC that the use of AI was not the problem but the misrepresentation of what the law said was the biggest issue in this case.\nHe said lying about what the law said was improper and unacceptable.\nLambasting the firm for the use of AI shouldn’t take centre-stage, so what if they used AI. The tool [AI] can be used properly; however, the judgment should highlight the misrepresentation of the relevance of the case law in the case itself.\nAdvocate Paul Hoffman, director of the Institute for Accountability in Southern Africa said this was an indication of laziness and unprofessionalism. He said the LPC should take a firm stance against it.\nALSO READ | [Artificial intelligence to recognise weather conditions](https://witness.co.za/news/2022/09/20/artificial-intelligence-to-recognise-weather-conditions/)\n“There should be rules and regulations set specifically for the use of AI, but it’s still the practitioner’s duty to do proper research.”\n• Additional reporting by GroundUp.\n[here](https://www.citizen.co.za/network-news/download-the-caxton-local-news-app/?utm_source=lnnsite&utm_medium=articlebutton&utm_campaign=lnnapp).",

Ce blocage suscite jeudi 8 août 2024 de très nombreuses réactions d’internautes sur le [réseau X](https://www.20minutes.fr/high-tech/twitter/). Des « contenus préjudiciables » ? Dans une déclaration postée sur X, le [ministre de la Justice](https://www.20minutes.fr/dossier/ministre_de_la_justice) Yilmaz Tunç explique cette décision par la présence de « contenus pouvant être préjudiciables aux enfants », qui « ont fait l’objet d’une [enquête ](https://www.20minutes.fr/dossier/enquete)menée par le parquet général d’Adana », une ville du sud de la Turquie.

En réponse aux accusations des autorités, la plateforme assure pourtant avoir retiré, à leur demande, près de 2.500 contenus au cours des six premiers mois de 2024. Mais ce blocage d’Instagram est intervenu après des accusations de « censure » portées par la [présidence turque](https://www.20minutes.fr/monde/recep_tayyip_erdogan/), affirmant que la plateforme avait « empêché les gens de publier des messages de condoléances pour le martyre du [(chef du Hamas Ismaïl) Haniyeh](https://www.20minutes.fr/monde/israel/4103857-20240731-guerre-israel-hamas-ismail-haniyeh-chef-mouvement-politique-hamas-tue-frappe-iran) », [tué à Téhéran](https://www.20minutes.fr/monde/israel/4103838-20240731-guerre-israel-hamas-chef-hamas-ismail-haniyeh-tue-frappe-teheran).

Cette offensive contre les [réseaux sociaux](https://www.20minutes.fr/dossier/reseaux_sociaux) risque de ne pas s’arrêter là : le président de la commission parlementaire sur les plateformes numériques, Huseyin Yayman, a affirmé que « la nation » demandait la fermeture de [TikTok](https://www.20minutes.fr/high-tech/tiktok/). « Les gens qui me voient dans la rue m’interpellent : \"Vous irez au paradis si vous fermez TikTok\", me disent-ils », a-t-il assuré dans une vidéo fournie à l’agence de presse locale DHA, évoquant des « citoyens » rencontrés à Hatay, Adana, Mersin, de grandes villes du sud, mais aussi à [Ankara](https://www.20minutes.fr/dossier/ankara), la capitale, et même à [Istanbul](https://www.20minutes.fr/monde/istanbul/).

    "text": "At a time when Congress has not publicly declared its decision to participate in the Ram temple inauguration or not, CPM State Secretary MV Govindan on Friday said the dilly-dallying shows the national party's political bankruptcy. Addressing the media here, Govindan said as the main opposition party, Congress has the responsibility to uphold the values of secularism. \"They still do not understand that they cannot beat the hard-core Hindutva with their soft Hindutva. This has not dawned on them even after the defeat in the assembly elections in five states,\" he said. According to Govindan, the people of Madhya Pradesh rejected the soft Hindutva of Congress. \"In Gujarat when soft Hindutva was used to tackle the BJP's hard-core Hindutva agenda, we saw Congress losing even its core voters\", he added. \"The opposition can form a secular front for the coming general elections only by assimilating all anti-BJP votes across India. But when the parties that should take the lead in such endeavours use soft Hindutva to oppose BJP, they are propounding the hardcore right-wing policies,\" Govindan said. \"Congress should take a bold stand against BJP agenda by upholding the traditions of the country and its secular values. This is the common belief among all parties who want to see the BJP defeated in the election,\" he added. He said the BJP's decision to move away from India's history of supporting the Palestinian cause has its roots in the Congress' governments' decision to normalise diplomatic relationship with Israel. CPM, which is a part of the grand opposition alliance called INDIA, has already declined the invitation from the central government to participate in the inauguration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya.",

Netanyahu chegou hoje em Nova York para participar da Assembleia Geral da ONU. Na conferência, as autoridades americanas e europeias estavam pressionando fortemente os dois lados para que aceitassem uma proposta de interrupção dos combates por 21 dias, a fim de dar tempo à diplomacia evitar uma possível guerra total. Netanyahu falou que a \"política de Israel é clara. Continuamos a atacar o Hezbollah com força total. E não vamos parar até atingirmos todos os nossos objetivos, o principal deles é o retorno dos residentes do norte para suas casas com segurança\". O Secretário de Estado dos EUA, Antony Blinken, esteve na ONU reunido com autoridades israelenses sobre a proposta de trégua. Em uma entrevista à MSNBC, ele disse que as principais potências, os europeus e as nações árabes estavam unidos, \"todos falando com uma voz clara sobre a necessidade de conseguir esse cessar-fogo\". \"Não posso falar por ele\", declarou Blinken sobre Netanyahu. O Hezbollah tem insistido que interromperá seus ataques somente se houver um cessar-fogo em Gaza. Saiba Mais Gostou da matéria?
