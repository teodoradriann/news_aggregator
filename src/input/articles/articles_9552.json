    "text": "During a recent appearance on “The Wrestle Spot” podcast, Jeff Hardy expressed his desire to reintroduce his Willow character to TNA Wrestling.\nHardy stated last year that Willow would “definitely” return after last appearing in 2016.\nHe said, “I’ve been talking about that a lot, man. In Hillsboro, North Carolina, there’s a new Willow mask. Me and my oldest daughter designed a new face plate, and he got it, and he made the mask. I just haven’t picked it up yet. But once I get there and try it on, if it feels good, I can’t wait to bust out a Willow promo on social media or something. [I’m] super excited about that, bringing Willow back to TNA. It’ll be so much better than it was before. I think in this current evolution of what we’re doing right now, I think we wanted to go through and win the titles as kind of the OG Hardy Boys, and then after we did that and we kind of claimed the prize that we really wanted, and that was [to] have another strong tag team title reign, I think even maybe starting as early as Genesis, you’re going to start seeing a little bit of an evolution of Matt and Jeff Hardy, where they’re going to transcend being pro wrestling superstars or whatever else. We have some ideas, we have some things on the table that we’re looking to implement, and I think it will have some things that remind people of the broken universe and those characters, characters that are a little larger than life, and we think it’s time to evolve and repackage ourselves. So we look forward to doing that in 2025.”\nDuring a recent interview with Tokyo Sports, Kazuchika Okada revealed why he missed NJPW x AEW Wrestle Dynasty 2025 at the Tokyo Dome.\nYou can check out some highlights from the podcast below:\nOn how he’s adjusted to being in AEW: “I wanted to put in the effort. That’s something I can’t do in Japan. Here, I have to do completely different things, like speak English, so that’s fun. The number of matches has decreased a lot, but the number of things that aren’t matches has increased a lot, so I feel it’s rewarding.”\nOn a possible rematch with Kenny Omega: “I don’t know what the situation will be like, and it’s not impossible that he’ll be in a bad shape after returning. He’s just recovered from an illness, so I think it would be good if he could take his time and get himself in shape.”\nOn what he wants people to notice about him now: “I’d like people to watch AEW, not Kazuchika Okada. There are a lot of good wrestlers, and they’re all cool. There’s a great atmosphere, so I hope people will realize how fun AEW is.”\nOn not appearing at Wrestle Dynasty: “I can’t really say anything about it (laughs bitterly). Whether I get an offer or not is another matter, but I don’t think it’s the right time yet. I quit with the feeling that I would never compete again (in Japanese matches). If I were to go back while I was feeling like I wanted to fight well in the US, then something might have changed in my feelings. I don’t have any intention of competing in a single match, so that’s the feeling I had when I went to the US.”",

    "text": "Китайская компания DeepSeek, занимающаяся разработкой искусственного интеллекта (ИИ), отложила выпуск своей новой модели R2 из-за сложностей с использованием чипов Huawei , пишет Financial Times (FT) со ссылкой на источники, знакомые с ситуацией.\nВласти Китая рекомендовали компании использовать процессор Huawei Ascend вместо систем Nvidia американского производства. Однако DeepSeek столкнулся с техническими проблемами в процессе обучения ИИ. Компания предложила альтернативный вариант – использовать чипы Nvidia для обучения и Huawei для вывода.\nFT пишет, что трудности DeepSeek показывают, что китайские чипы по-прежнему отстают от американских конкурентов. Источники издания заявили, что у процессоров Ascend проблемы со стабильностью, более медленное соединение между чипами и хуже программное обеспечение по сравнению с продуктами Nvidia.\nDeepSeek выпустили обновленную версию модели ИИ R1 29 мая. Она может выполнять более сложные задачи с помощью пошагового логического процесса мышления. На сайте LiveCodeBench, который сравнивал модели с различными показателями, обновленная R1 стоит сразу за моделями OpenAI o4-mini и o3 reasoning.",

    "text": "WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. — The FBI just released a report that shows violent crime is going down nationally. It looks at crime trends for January through March 2024, compared to the same time frame last year. Nationally, reported violent crime decreased by 15%, and murder was more than 26% lower. Robbery dipped by nearly 18%, and aggravated assault dropped by under 13%. The FBI got the information from 14,000 of the 19,000 law enforcement agencies across the country. One of those reporting agencies is the Winston-Salem Police Department, also seeing that positive trend. Winston-Salem Police Captain Kyle Krawczyk said it's a positive trend to see. \"All of our violent crimes have reduced, and in our first quarter of this year, especially the homicides, which is very notable, we've had a 50% decrease in homicides this year compared to last year at this time,\" said Krawczyk. Krawczyk said their Violent Firearms Investigation Team, Gun Crime Reduction Unit, and Real-Time Crime Center are a big part of their success. \"It's outstanding to see the work that we do as a law enforcement agency in conjunction with other local departments to see this decrease in crime,\" said Krawczyk. \"Of course, that's what we want. That's what the community wants.\" Winston-Salem is not alone in that success. In Greensboro, homicides have been down 28% in the past year. There are fewer aggravated assault cases, from 312 in 2023 to 281 in 2024. Also, officers have seized 152 more guns compared to last year.",

    "text": "Hurricane Milton Weather Model Proved to Be Highly Accurate Data team members at precip.ai recently compared the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh Model of the hurricane to information on the actual storm. Staffers discovered it had provided a realistic depiction of the event. (TNS) — As meteorologists we always like to go back and see how a particular weather model forecasted a storm versus what actually was observed. Here’s a high-tech look at a model trying to outguess Hurricane Milton. We meteorologists use numerous weather models. Our model of choice can be different with different parts of the country or different types of weather, like hurricanes. One model that is usually up in the favorites for a short-term storm forecast is the High Resolution Rapid Refresh Model (HRRR). The data team at While the model wasn’t spot on exact with the areas of high rain and wind, it did give a very accurate depiction of the high-end weather event. This is one of the greatest improvements in the weather models over the years. The models are now able to forecast historic, potentially deadly weather events a few days in advance. Let’s start with the amount of total rain that actually fell during Hurricane Milton. Was this historically heavy rain forecasted by one of our best high resolution weather models? It was, and quite accurately but not exactly. You see a slight shift south in where the model had the heaviest rain versus where the heaviest actually fell, but it‘s very close. The model had the heaviest rain in a gray color at 15 inches. This was about right on with the observed heaviest rainfall. The heaviest rains officially tallied were over 18 inches around St. Petersburg, Fla. The model didn’t have the top end rains in central Florida, so it was a few inches off there. As a meteorologist I always figure when we get to some certain high amount on rain it doesn’t matter if it’s a few inches over that high forecast amount. It does in reality do more damage. If you are ordered to evacuate because of 10 inches of rain, you’d still be evacuating at 15 inches of rain. In all, for a very top-end rainfall the models achieved our goal to get you warned about deadly flooding. How did the HRRR do in forecasting maximum sustained winds? That’s our next comparison, and I think you’ll be pretty impressed with the modeling accuracy. Let’s first start again with the simple map of what the highest maximum sustained wind actually was in Hurricane Milton. These are not wind gusts, but the steady wind that lasts for minutes. We get a few key points off of the derived actual windfield with Milton. Hurricane winds are strongest over the water and weaken somewhat over land. We get to see the highest steady winds were around 120 mph just 30 miles off the coast of Bradenton, Fla. Also notice the purple area aimed at Manasota Key at Englewood, Fla. You probably saw all of the devastation on Manasota Key. There was a stronger wind area with steady winds up to 95 mph. Now how was the wind forecast from the HRRR model compared to what actually happened? Move the slider bar all the way to the right and see the actual windfield. Then move the slider bar left and see how the HRRR forecasted the windfield. The model had too large of a high-wind windfield but was positioned fairly closely to reality. The wind forecast was close enough to target key Florida cities as being in the path of the highest winds in Hurricane Milton. The suite of weather models from NOAA continues to be tweaked for accuracy. New weather models are always being developed and older models are being retired as the accuracy of the new models overtake the old. In fact this very model we’ve been looking at, the HRRR, is slated to be retired at the end of this year. ©2024 Advance Local Media LLC. Visit We meteorologists use numerous weather models. Our model of choice can be different with different parts of the country or different types of weather, like hurricanes. One model that is usually up in the favorites for a short-term storm forecast is the High Resolution Rapid Refresh Model (HRRR). The data team at [precip.ai](https://precip.ai/)did a comparison of the HRRR Model’s rain and wind forecast and the actual observations of the rain and wind after Hurricane Milton was over.While the model wasn’t spot on exact with the areas of high rain and wind, it did give a very accurate depiction of the high-end weather event. This is one of the greatest improvements in the weather models over the years. The models are now able to forecast historic, potentially deadly weather events a few days in advance. Let’s start with the amount of total rain that actually fell during Hurricane Milton. [Precip.ai](https://precip.ai/)used a method from an accurate past weather database to develop the total rainfall. They added all of the 1.5 mile by 1.5 mile squares of total rain and found Hurricane Milton dropped 2.6 trillion gallons of water over Florida. To put this in perspective, one inch of water on Lakes Michigan and Huron is 800 billion gallons of water. The rain from Hurricane Milton would have raised the water level of Lakes Michigan and Huron over three inches. That’s a staggering amount of water.Was this historically heavy rain forecasted by one of our best high resolution weather models? It was, and quite accurately but not exactly. [Precip.ai](https://precip.ai/)gives us another neat graphical comparison. In the image below slide the bar to the right and that shows how much and where the model forecasted Milton‘s rain. Slide the bar to the left and you’ll see how much and where the actual rain fell.You see a slight shift south in where the model had the heaviest rain versus where the heaviest actually fell, but it‘s very close.

Then move the slider bar left and see how the HRRR forecasted the windfield. The model had too large of a high-wind windfield but was positioned fairly closely to reality. The wind forecast was close enough to target key Florida cities as being in the path of the highest winds in Hurricane Milton. The suite of weather models from NOAA continues to be tweaked for accuracy. New weather models are always being developed and older models are being retired as the accuracy of the new models overtake the old. In fact this very model we’ve been looking at, the HRRR, is slated to be retired at the end of this year. ©2024 Advance Local Media LLC. Visit",

    "text": "Why Businesses Must Address Cloud Security Risks The widespread adoption of cloud computing services has resulted in a massive shift in cybersecurity, said Prateek Goel, director of product marketing and strategy for Wiz . The cloud changed the way companies consume IT, but it has also introduced new challenges. “The cloud has really changed the paradigm for security, and the risks that are coming up are totally new” he said. “The cloud comes up with new applications every month, but new security risks come with them.” To address these risks, Goal advised, organizations should adopt a security approach that involves representatives from every part of the company. IT professionals charged with cybersecurity need full visibility of the environment to identify the risks they face. While every effort should be made to prevent breaches, IT leaders must assume that at some point, such efforts will fail. “Being proactive is not enough,” Goel said. There will be things that slip through, so you need to have a reactive capability as well, so you can reduce the blast radius of a breach.” READ MORE: Experts explore a security architecture for the AI era. A Blistering Pace of Change in Cybersecurity The cybersecurity landscape has changed immensely over the past three years and could be unrecognizable three years from now, said Marcos Christodonte II, vice president and global CISO for CDW, during a presentation at the SummIT. For example, phishing emails are much more sophisticated now than they were a few years ago. Cybercriminals are carrying out attacks via communication platforms such as Slack and also incorporating techniques such as QR codes. Artificial intelligence is also being used to create deepfakes to fool targets into taking actions that benefit cybercriminals. “Lives are absolutely being disrupted by the damage caused by these attacks,” Christodonte said. Christodonte sees the history of cybersecurity dotted by events that became inflection points where organizations either succeeded or failed. These events include the proliferation of the Morris worm in 1988, which was one of the first cyberattacks distributed via the internet, and the SolarWinds attack in 2019 and the CrowdStrike outage in 2024. Organizations need strategy and agility to be ready to come out on the right side of these inflection points. “This is why we need to rethink our approach to cybersecurity,” Christodonte said. “We need to be faster. We need to be much more strategic.” This strategy must keep pace with a rapidly shifting landscape in which cybercriminals never seem to slow down. “With every technological advance, new cyber risks surface to threaten us,” Christodonte said. For example, quantum computing may pose the next inflection point organizations must navigate. Right now, cybercriminals are stealing encrypted data that they aim to access when quantum decryption technology becomes available over the next few years. Security strategies should help organizations prepare now for these events in the future. REVIEW: How to best secure AI projects. Elements of an Effective Cybersecurity Strategy Christodonte recommended that IT leaders adopt what he calls a “leveraged cybersecurity” model. Under this approach, organizations leverage people and the user experience to reduce the friction that users face due to security measures. This may require organizations to conduct pilots and phased rollouts of new tools and take steps to ensure that they are adopted fully. This strategy aims to minimize an organization’s reliance on any single technology vendor, prioritize the biggest security risks and optimize the use of existing security tools. The model also includes leveraged processes that aim to be more seamless, standardized and scalable. CDW has adopted several security measures that follow this approach. For example, Sanjay Sood, the company’s senior vice president and CTO, said over 98% of CDW coworkers are enrolled in a passwordless login experience that reduces frustration while improving security. CDW is also focused on security from a risk-based perspective. Conor Waddell, senior vice president of integrated technology for CDW, said the ability to assign a dollar value to security risks helps CDW prioritize them. “Quantifying risk is really the focus of what we’re doing,” he added. As they work to establish and deploy their strategies, IT leaders must keep an eye on the future, Christodonte said. Cyberthreats continue to evolve, and security strategies must enable the agility for organizations to adapt. “Cybersecurity is like chess,” he said. “You have to be thinking three steps ahead.” Find BizTech’s full coverage of the event here .

    "text": "Le possibilità di un accordo tra Hamas e Israele sul piano proposto da Joe Biden per un cessate il fuoco nella Striscia di Gaza sembrano ridotte al lumicino.\nYahya Sinwar , leader di Hamas nella Striscia, ha informato i Paesi mediatori che “ Hamas non consegnerà le armi né firmerà una proposta che lo richieda “.\nA riferirlo il Wall Street Journal, il quotidiano statunitense ripreso dai media israeliani. Secondo il giornale Sinwar ha inoltre affermato che accetterà un accordo con gli ostaggi solo se Israele si impegnerà ad un cessate il fuoco permanente .\nLa posizione di Hamas In giornata si erano susseguite notizie dai toni più disparati sulle intenzioni del gruppo radicale islamico in merito al piano Biden. L’emittente egiziana all-news Al-Qahera , citando una fonte di alto livello rimasta anonima, aveva riferito che l’Egitto aveva ricevuto “segnali positivi” da Hamas sulla proposta di accordo per un cessate il fuoco a Gaza e il rilascio degli ostaggi.\nAl contrario l’emittente israeliana Kan aveva riferito che Hamas avrebbe respinto la proposta israeliana di un accordo per il rilascio degli ostaggi e l’attuazione di un cessate il fuoco a Gaza perché la proposta avanzata da Israele era “fondamentalmente diversa da quella presentata dal presidente degli Stati Uniti Joe Biden, e non garantisce nient’altro che un cessate il fuoco temporaneo”.\nDal resto del mondo continua intanto il pressing su Israele e Hamas affinché si fermino gli attacchi, che hanno provocato oltre 36mila vittime nella Striscia, con la conseguente liberazione degli ostaggi.\nL’appello di 17 Paesi per un accordo Israele-Hamas In questa ottica va letto l’ appello firmato da 17 Paesi rivolto ai leader di Israele e Hamas di fare tutti i compromessi finali necessari per concludere” l’accordo sul cessate il fuoco a Gaza e la liberazione degli ostaggi, sulla base del piano del presidente Usa Joe Biden.\nAll’appello diffuso dalla Casa Bianca aderiscono Stati Uniti, Spagna, Argentina, Austria, Brasile, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Danimarca, Francia, Germania, Polonia, Portogallo, Romania, Serbia, Thailandia e Gran Bretagna .\nQuali “leader di paesi profondamente preoccupati per gli ostaggi, tra cui molti dei nostri cittadini, sosteniamo pienamente il movimento” per la tregua e un accordo sul rilascio degli ostaggi “. “ Non c’è tempo da perdere. Chiediamo ad Hamas di concludere questo accordo, che Israele è pronto a portare avanti, e di avviare il processo di rilascio dei nostri cittadini “, si legge nel comunicato.\n“ Questo accordo porterebbe a un cessate il fuoco immediato e alla riabilitazione di Gaza insieme a garanzie di sicurezza per israeliani e palestinesi e opportunità per una pace più duratura a lungo termine e una soluzione a due Stati. In questo momento decisivo, chiediamo ai leader di Israele e di Hamas di fare tutti i compromessi finali necessari per concludere questo accordo e portare sollievo alle famiglie dei nostri ostaggi, così come a quelle di entrambe le parti di questo terribile conflitto, comprese le popolazioni civili. È tempo che la guerra finisca e questo accordo è il punto di partenza necessario “.",

    "title": "Wins keep piling up for Dolores wrestlers – The Journal",
    "text": "After a slow start to the season filled with learning opportunities, the Dolores wrestling program is starting to really gain traction. Filling up the lighter weight divisions, the Bears continue to develop – and now have some nice midseason victories to show for their efforts. Hosting their lone home matches of the season, Dolores put together an impressive showcase in front of their fans, while also honoring their three seniors in matches against Montezuma-Cortez, Ignacio, and Monticello. A day later, the Bears earned a pair of top-eight finishers in the Rocky Mountain Invitational at Pagosa Springs in their opening action for 2024. On their home mat, several Bears picked up pin victories in their dual against Monticello, led by seniors Talon Fish (144 pounds) and Dylan Koskie (132 pounds). Underclassmen Tristan Schuster (126 pounds) and Kale Bates (150 pounds) added wins for Dolores, while sophomore Nathan Hill (132 pounds) collected a pin in a match against Ignacio. While the Bears dropped all three of the duals, they held their own, with the senior-led victories from Fish and Koskie igniting the Bears corner. A day later, Koskie and freshman Kenji Edwards (120 pounds) earned two victories apiece for head coach Casen Eldridge’s crew, with both wrestlers taking eighth place in their respective weight divisions. Schuster, Hill, and freshman River Wickstrom (138 pounds) all came home with a win from Pagosa as well. For a squad continuing to build confidence, the on-mat success feeds the growth in work ethic and determination, according to the Bears head coach. “The amount of fight we have, being a young team – it’s been impressive to me,” said Eldridge. “The kids are willing to learn, try new things, they’re willing to execute something that we worked on in practice in live action.” “We’re working through positions that we’re not used to,” said Hill, one of the team captains, “and we’re looking to get out of them and find ways to score – it doesn’t work all the time, but we’re getting better.” For Hill, the cohesiveness of the team has played a large role in the improvement as well. “We’re all really close in weight, so practice is fun – we’re able to jump around and work with all of our teammates – we’re supportive of each other.” Now, with a month remaining before the 2A regional matches, the Bears look forward to the increased importance of their upcoming matches. The Bears head to Nucla on Saturday, Jan. 13 for matches in the Nucla/Norwood Invitational, before trips to Dove Creek on the 16th and Monticello on the following evening. “We have to go in to these matches believing we’re the best one there,” added Hill, “our goal is to peak during the regional time – and we’ve picked up the intensity in practices to help get us ready.”",
