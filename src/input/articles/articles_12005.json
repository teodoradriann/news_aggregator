    "text": "2025 has got off to a shivering start, as Arctic air sweeps across the UK leading to plunging temperatures.Most of the UK is set for snow over the weekend, with the Met Office issuing two amber warnings - and predicting some places could see 40cm of snow .But it's the advance of a milder, rain bearing system that is setting alarm bells ringing.What's causing the cold snap? Low pressure to the east of us and high pressure sitting to the west is creating a cold northerly wind, dragging arctic air in across the UK. With temperatures plunging, any showers will fall as sleet and snow.So far, so normal.The complication comes in the form of a collection of rain-bearing frontal systems moving in from the southwest later on Saturday night.When the rain along those systems meets the cold air sitting across the UK, there is the potential for some significant - albeit brief - snowfall causing widespread disruption and hazardous conditions.Additionally, strong winds will bring blizzards across northern England in particular, hampering snow clearance efforts and, with temperatures briefly rising during the second half of the weekend, snow melt is likely to cause localised flooding .Another, less usual but particularly dangerous hazard comes in the form of freezing rain.This is when the air temperature is mild enough for rain, rather than snow to fall, but the ground is frozen which makes the rain freeze on contact. This creates treacherous icy conditions and is particularly likely across Wales and the north Midlands.Once that Atlantic system has swept in from the southwest on Saturday night and Sunday, the winds swing back to a bitterly cold northerly again throughout Monday, setting us up for a cold week with the potential for further wintry hazards.Subscribe free to our weekly newsletter for exclusive and original coverage from ITV News. Direct to your inbox every Friday morning. How unusual is this? These conditions are not unusual at all for the time of year.However, with recent winters generally on the milder side, this hazardous wintry weather will come as a bit of a shock to the system for many.As always, it is strongly advised that you keep up to date with the latest weather forecast in your area.Want a quick and expert briefing on the biggest news stories?
