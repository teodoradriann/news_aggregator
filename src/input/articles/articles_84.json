    "title": "Obituary: Trevor Anderson: James Bay fixture was a lighthouse keeper, sailor and war veteran",
    "text": "For more than 15 years, Trev Anderson was a fixture in James Bay, sitting in his favourite chair on the front porch of his Niagara Street home in his signature black hat, waving, chatting and even blowing the odd passersby a kiss. In return, Anderson, who died Monday at the age of 103, got to pet all the dogs in the neighbourhood and a chance to taste a sampling of brownies for his sweet tooth. Those he greeted would have little idea of the colourful life the friendly senior had lived. That life included narrowly escaping after his plane was shot down in the Second World War, becoming a lighthouse keeper in the early 1960s, and building a 55-foot sailboat to live on board for eight years — despite little knowledge of how to sail. “My dad was vivacious up to the end — that’s just how he lived life,” said Adrianne Lowden, the youngest of Anderson’s four children with wife Flo (Florence), who died in 2017. “He was as tough as nails but he also had an incredible sense of humour.” Trevor Maxwell Anderson was born in Regina, Sask., on Oct. 22, 1920. His family moved to northern British Columbia when he was around six and he spent some of his teenage years in Shawnigan Lake, finally moving to Victoria in his late teens. He enlisted in 1941, receiving training as a wireless operator and gunner. He was stationed in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Sicily, flying in B-25 bombers attached to the Royal Air Force. When not operating the Morse code machine, he was responsible for two 50-calibre machine guns in the bomber’s belly. His plane was shot down on his fourth mission, crash-landing in the Mediterranean Sea — there is a picture of the stricken plane, taken from another plane in the formation, on the wall of his James Bay home. “Dad told me that the only way out was through a 10-inch [square] window — he remembered kicking it,” said Lowden. She said that her father can’t recall how he managed to fit through the small opening, as he was wearing heavy gear to keep out the cold and an inflatable jacket as well. All the crew survived the crash and scrambled onto a life raft. They were picked up by a fishing boat, but the engine died, delaying their return to dry land for three days. The experience did not deter Anderson from returning to the air. He completed a total of 55 missions, with the usual number for gunners typically running 25 to 30. It was during his tour of North Africa that he began to write to Flo, his future wife. In one of the letters, he asked her to marry him — and she accepted. They married in 1944 and the two were together until Flo’s death. He enlisted with the Air Force upon his return from North Africa, retiring in 1960. The following year, with Flo and two boys and two girls in tow, he became a lighthouse keeper, initially on Lennard Island, on the southwest entrance to Templar Channel, north of Tofino. The family became “rock hoppers” stationed at various lighthouses, including Green Island, 40 kilometres northwest of Prince Rupert, the northernmost lighthouse that was staffed. In 1966, they were assigned to Race Rocks, where they remained until Anderson retired for the final time in 1982. While he was on Race Rocks, he got the notion of building a sailboat, though he was a novice sailor. It took the couple seven years to build a 55-foot ketch — a two-masted sailboat — which they christened WaWa. They learned to sail, cruising the Gulf Islands and circumnavigating Vancouver Island before heading to the South Pacific in 1985. “My parents gave us incredible lives,” said Lowden. “My siblings and I had the fortune to grow up fully and share the adventure.” She said both her parents wrote books about their experiences. Her mother wrote an autobiography called Lighthouse Chronicles about the lighthouse years, while her father wrote The War and I about his wartime experiences, with both of them collaborating on All At Sea about their time on the water. After their South Seas adventure, they returned to Victoria in 1987, living aboard WaWa for another eight years. After selling the boat, they jumped into a camper and travelled around North America until 1999, when they returned to Victoria. The couple settled into the 1904 house on Niagara Street that Flo’s parents had originally bought in 1959. That’s where Anderson would sit on the front porch and greet passerby from his favourite old armchair. Once he determined that the neighbourhood was safe and secure, he would retire for his afternoon nap. “He was up and about until about two weeks ago,” said Lowden Since his 100th birthday, Anderson’s children, Adrienne, Beth, Stan and Garry, have been putting up a banner on the front porch saying “TREV, Happy Birthday,” followed by his age. This week, the birthday wishes were replaced with Bon Voyage as a send-off for a life well-lived. parrais@timescolonist.com >>> To comment on this article, write a letter to the editor: letters@timescolonist.com",

    "text": "Vancouver’s Catholic Archbishop says a ‘Sacred Covenant’ agreement has been reached with the First Nation in Kamloops, B.C., that announced the discovery the remains of more than 200 children at the site of a former residential school. Archbishop J. Michael Miller of the Catholic archdiocese of Vancouver says the agreement with the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc will open a “new chapter” in the relationship between the church and First Nations in B.C. Miller says the church recognizes its complicity in the Canadian government’s colonialist policies toward First Nations and the “resulting tragedies” from the residential school system. Chief Rosanne Casimir of Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc says the covenant will see the church share records and information as the nation continues to investigate the site of a former Kamloops Indian Residential School where hundreds of children went missing. The nation announced in May 2021 that a search around the former school site using ground-penetrating radar found the unmarked burial sites of the remains of more than 200 children who were students at the school. The Nation and the archdiocese say the agreement includes commitments from the church on how to properly memorialize residential school survivors, information sharing about missing children and to offer “healing services” to family members of those who attended the school.

    "text": "本报讯 （报业集团记者 郑琳琳 通讯员 林舒 许烨婷） 近日，福建中医药大学恢复骨伤学院独立建制。40多年来，在几代骨伤人的努力下，骨伤学科一直被国家中医药管理局列为重点学科，并创造了独特的南少林现代骨伤科思想体系，形成了南少林特色的中医骨伤科思想流派。\n4月17日下午，“主流媒体福州大学城巡礼”活动走进福建中医药大学，主流媒体记者团实地探访福建中医药大学，了解该校中医骨伤科学学科背后的故事。作为一个在全国首开中医骨伤科学专业本科教育的学科，是如何写好“传承”与“创新”篇章的？\n一张张照片、一件件老物件……走进中医骨伤学科展览室，骨伤学科历史跃然眼前。\n福建中医药大学骨伤学院负责主持工作的副院长李楠介绍：“中医骨伤学科是在传承南少林骨伤著名医家林如高医疗经验和专长的基础上，为培养新一代中医骨伤科专业人才而成立的。遵照周恩来总理‘将他的医疗经验整理出来，留给后代，为人民服务’的指示，1975年福建省卫生厅先后派张安桢、王和鸣等与林子顺医师一起整理中国著名骨伤科专家林如高先生的正骨经验。1978年，张安桢、王和鸣调入福建中医学院后，在林如高老先生的支持下，于1981年4月在全国首先创办中医骨伤科学专业，在全国产生影响，中医骨伤学科应运而生。”\n学校中医骨伤学科的发展也一步一个脚印，稳扎稳打。1985年获中医骨伤科学硕士学位授权点；1993年被批准为国家中医药管理局重点学科；1995年被批准为福建省“211工程”重点学科；1998年经国务院学位委员会批准为博士学位授权点；2002年再次被批准为国家中医药管理局重点学科；2010年第三次被国家中医药管理局列为重点学科，同年更名为福建中医药大学骨伤学院……\n2017年，因教育部专业目录调整，学校撤销骨伤学院二级党委建制，骨伤学院教师并入中医学院，成立中医骨伤科学教研室，但这并不影响骨伤学科前行的步伐。中医骨伤学科立足于南少林骨伤流派传统，将禅、医、武完美结合，共同构成了该学科的鲜明特色。\n据了解，该学科在传承南少林骨伤流派传统基础上，通过人工智能、力学等多学科融合实现系统性创新，结合AI技术研发骨折复位模拟系统、手法整脊数字化平台及疾病预警模型，实现传统经验的智能转化并得到创新发展。\n李楠表示：“学科创新发展离不开人才的全方位培养。”在培养现代骨伤人才上，学科致力于构建多元化、创新性教育体系。积极推进虚拟仿真技术融入实践教学，打造线上线下混合教学模式与智慧课程群，增强教学互动与实效。增设南少林特色课程，融合传统骨伤技艺与现代医学理论，强化学生文化底蕴与专业技能。实施“科研进课堂”，鼓励学生参与项目，培养科研思维与能力。同时倡导创新创业教育，激发创新意识与创业精神。推行“3+2”联合培养模式，校院深度合作，实现理论与临床实践无缝对接。这一体系通过技术赋能、文化传承、科研反哺和临床深化，培养了一批批思想正直、专业过硬、技术拔尖的新时代骨伤专业人才。\n据悉，该学科一直被国家中医药管理局列为重点学科，是国家中医药管理局高水平中医药重点学科建设项目，国家级规划教材《中医骨伤科学》《中医正骨学》《骨伤内伤学》《骨伤科影像学》主编单位，第一批国家中医药管理局学术流派工作室建设单位，第二批全国中医学术流派传承工作室建设单位；拥有中医骨伤及运动康复省部共建教育部重点实验室、国家中医药管理局骨重建生物力学实验室等；2021年，南少林理筋整脊疗法列入国务院第五批国家级非物质文化遗产代表性项目名录。\n当天，主流媒体记者团还走进该校中医药文化博物馆、中医证研究基地、康复产业研究院、中西医结合研究院，共同探访了新时代中医学教育的使命与贡献。",

El horror que viven criaturas, civiles y gente desarmada es tan grande, que se han quitado la aceptación. Ya no se acepta lo de Israel. No se aceptó lo de Hamas, pero ahora el drama y el horror lo comete 20 veces más Israel. Y no parece que vayan a parar.\n[#4](c4#c-4) gobierno ilegitimo, pues llevaban son elecciones demasiado tiempo, y el nivel democratico es ya de inicio nulo, pues se trata de unas elecciones en un campo de concentración. La gente no es libre para vivir, nose puede esperar que voten libremente. Votaron por la paz, y se les traicionó, asi que hace 10 años votaron rabia....y nunca más han podido decidir.\nTeniendo encm cuenta la edad media rn gaza (18 años) apenas queda gente que haya votado por Hamás (o por nadie).\n[#9](c9#c-9) aquí cada uno se monta la película que más le gusta para justificar crímenes horribles, por cada lado.\nAsí vamos.\n[#1](c1#c-1) No. De hecho hay una porción importante de los que van a esa manifestación que apoyan dichos ataques y les gustaría ver más.",
