    "title": "Himachal Pradesh Rain Mandi: Himachal Man Saves 4 Lives During Disaster, Daughter Shows Courage Too",
    "text": "A man and his daughter from a village in Himachal Pradesh's Mandi district demonstrated rare courage during the dreadful night of June 30 by not only defeating death but also saving the lives of four people. Cloudbursts, flash floods and landslides swallowed houses and lands on the fateful night killing 15 people, injuring five, and forcing search operations to trace 27 missing people who were washed away in the intervening night of June 30 and July 1 in different parts of Mandi district. People ran helter-skelter as gushing waters and debris started entering the houses. Twenty people took shelter in the house of Bharat Raj while the fury of water and debris increased. Bharat Raj, his daughter Tanuja, sister Twinkle, mother Mansa Devi, grandfather Hari Singh and another woman Radhu Devi were bogged in the debris and death stared in their faces. Bharat Raj showed rare courage and pulled out Twinkle, Mansa Devi, Hari Singh and Radhu Devi from the debris but Tanuja was swept a few metres away, said villagers. Tanuja sank chest deep in the debris. She struggled hard and finally came out with the help of a piece of a log and reached a safer location. It was nothing but a miracle as everybody feared that she would not survive. It was a highly emotional moment when she got reunited with her family members. All the saved persons were taken to a temporary shelter at Bagsyad School and are still there. Leader of the Opposition Jai Ram Thakur met Bharat Raj, Tanuja and other family members and praised the father-daughter duo for the rare courage they showed. Tanuja said that they have lost everything and have no means of livelihood which was affecting her studies. She urged the government to bear the expenses of her education and take immediate steps for her family's rehabilitation. Thakur, who has been intensively campaigning to reach out to the affected people and share their grief and provide relief for the past 10 days, reached his native village Tandi and found that his ancestral house was also damaged. It developed cracks and about half of the orchard has also been washed away. He said that his Seraj constituency was the worst affected and suffered losses to the tune of Rs 500 crore and claimed that it is likely to increase to Rs 1,000 crore. The BJP leader, who is also a former chief minister, said that houses, cultivable land and orchards have been washed away and the livelihood of the people was affected. He urged the government to speed up the rehabilitation works and construct prefabricated houses for homeless people. Revenue and Horticulture Minister Jagat Singh Negi on Thursday said classes of Thunag College of Horticulture and Forestry in Seraj with 300 students on roll would be shifted to Sundernagar as holding classes in Thunag was no longer feasible. The calamity has also caused extensive damage to property, affecting 1,184 houses, 710 cow sheds and 201 shops. Seven hundred eighty livestock have also perished in the disaster.

    "text": "Retail sales volumes were estimated to be flat (0%) in February 2024, following an increase of 3.6% in January 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Wet weather put off many people from heading out to the high street, with the South of England experiencing more than twice the level of average rainfall. The ONS said that retail sales volumes in clothing and department stores grew because of new collections, but falls in food stores and fuel retailers offset this growth. Sales volumes at department stores and other non-food stores also grew over the month (by 1.6% and 0.4%, respectively). However, household goods stores fell by 1%, with respondents reporting the economic climate and poor weather as factors that contributed to the fall. Overall, sales volumes fell by 0.4% in the three months to February 2024 when compared with the previous three months, and by 1% when compared with the three months to February 2023. Online sales up The amount spent online rose by 2.1% over the month to February 2024 (2.2% over the year). The ONS said this monthly rise was the largest since July 2023, when shoppers switched to online shopping because of poor weather and increased promotions. Clothing retailers reported strong online sales, while department stores and household goods stores were the only two sub-sectors where retail sales values fell over the month. This monthly increase in online sales led to a rise in the proportion of sales made online, from 25.1% in January 2024 to 25.7% in February 2024. Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said: “No surprises that February’s downpours kept people off high streets and tucked up in their dry living rooms. But consumers were tempted by new season collections and turned back to online shopping to expand their wardrobes. “Just like last July, the proportion of online sales shot up as shoppers made the most of promotions to add a splash of spring colour to their working attire, even if winter remained firmly entrenched outside the door. “After a few tricky months, clothing retailers needed a win, and those that have toiled to create must-have pieces at a price point that works for their buyer will be feeling a kind of fuzzy relief. It wasn’t all good news, and those gains for virtual department and clothing stores were offset by falls in food and fuel.” Related: [Shoppers spent less as wet weather rained on retail sales](https://www.yourmoney.com/economy/shoppers-spent-less-as-wet-weather-rained-on-retail-sales/)",

Même si, depuis le début de l'Euro 2024, les performances des hommes de Didier Deschamps ne les rassurent pas. \"Le jeu, ce n'est pas forcément bien, mais ça ne lâche pas et ça se bat, et ça, j'aime bien\", confie l'un d'eux.

J'ai l'impression qu'avec cette équipe de France, c'est un peu çaBixente Lizarazu Avant de démarrer cet Euro en Allemagne, Antoine Griezmann avait prévenu et reconnaissait que le jeu des Bleus manquait un peu d'enthousiasme : \"C'est très chiant à regarder mais bon c'est comme ça, ça fait gagner...\" Oui, l'équipe de France est sûre de ses forces, puissante et remarquable en défense.

Cuando pasa esto, ya es \"justicia\".\nPues la LIVG la firmaron TODOS, incluido el PP...\n[#11](c11#c-11) ¿en base a que me incluyes en ese grupo? Vaya un “y tú más” más patético, que lástima que tu mejor defensa sea inventarte lo que pienso, que además de ser mentira es una bobada doble, porque además de ser una burda mentira haces como si una injusticia más otra injusticia sumasen justicia, cuando lo que suma es doble injusticia.\nQue lamentable colega, en serio.\nTodo el neofeminismo gira en torno a esta idea: puesto que las mujeres tienen un miedo constante a que un hombre las viole o las maltrate, la igualdad que se busca es que todos los hombres tengan miedo también a encontrarse con una loca que les denuncie y vayan a la cárcel.\nPara ello se anulan los derechos que haya que anular, presunción de inocencia, necesidad de pruebas, etc...\nDe este modo se impone el criterio de una minoría de mujeres aterrorizadas sin justificación por los hombres que sólo quieren venganza disfrazada de una supuesta igualdad que es de todo menos eso.\nQue vayan saliendo todos los mierdecillas que siempre dicen que es falso que basta la palabra de una mujer para que te comas 10 años de trullo... No, que sigan escondidos como ratas que son, me conformo con que les pase a ellos y a su familiares.\n[#10](c10#c-10) Has escogido el caso más desafortunado posible para decir ese comentario. El tipo fue condenado, y solo ha conseguido la absolución cuando ELLA HA RECONOCIDO LA DENUNCIA FALSA.\nHa sido su palabra la que le metió en prisión y ha sido su palabra la que le ha sacado de ahí.\nHermano, date cuenta... al menos, en esta noticia, los mierdecillas esos de los que habla tienen más razón que tú\n[#15](c15#c-15) no creo que sea así. Si los jueces lo condenaron fue unicamente por la palabra de la tiparraca... y esto le puede pasar a cualquiera, los jueces no tienen en cuenta más que eso. La confesión posterior, que puede ocurrir o no, dependiendo de muchos factores, lo unico que hace es dejarlo más claro todavía. Los jueces solo tienen en cuenta la palabra de una loca, porque no pueden existir otras pruebas al ser una denuncia falsa. Si la tipa no tiene remordimiento o teme simplemente las consecuencias de haber mentido al tribunal, o el miedo a que familiares y amigos sepan la verdad ... el tio se come los 10 añitos, que es lo que estara pasando en la mayoría de los casos.\n[#0](c0#c-0) no es esta?\nHe podido leer la sentencia del TSJ que ha absuelto a este hombre de violación",

    "title": "Por qué no se debe mezclar nunca vinagre con sal o bicarbonato de sodio: expertos advierten sobre su uso para limpiar - Infobae",
    "text": "Mezclar ambos productos puede neutralizar sus beneficios individuales, resultando en una mezcla ineficaz - crédito Freepik e Imagen ilustrativa Infobae La combinación de bicarbonato y vinagre se ha convertido en un truco casero ampliamente difundido para limpiar todo tipo de superficies, eliminar manchas e incluso desinfectar. Este consejo, transmitido por generaciones, parece tener un lugar asegurado en los hogares.\nSin embargo, su eficacia real y los posibles riesgos de su uso han sido cuestionados por expertos en química y salud, quienes han revelado lo que verdaderamente sucede al mezclar estos dos componentes .\nAhora puede seguirnos en Facebook y en nuestro WhatsApp Channel .\n¿Qué sucede al mezclar bicarbonato y vinagre? Desde un punto de vista químico, mezclar bicarbonato de sodio, una base, con vinagre, un ácido que contiene ácido acético, genera una reacción química que produce agua, dióxido de carbono (burbujas) y acetato de sodio, una sal. Esta reacción, aunque vistosa, no tiene propiedades limpiadoras significativas.\nSegún Amanda Morris, directora asociada del departamento de química en Virginia Tech, el resultado es lo que ella llama “agua glorificada”. El burbujeo característico se debe a la formación de ácido carbónico, un compuesto muy inestable que se descompone rápidamente .\nUtilizar estas mezclas en recipientes pequeños o en espacios cerrados puede generar riesgos como la acumulación de dióxido de carbono - crédito iStock “ El movimiento mecánico de las burbujas puede ayudar a despegar residuos en algunos casos, pero una vez que desaparecen, la mezcla pierde toda utilidad ”, explicó Morris en una entrevista con The Kitchn . De hecho, emplear bicarbonato y vinagre juntos podría incluso ser contraproducente, ya que neutralizan mutuamente sus propiedades individuales.\nEntonces, ¿para qué sirven el bicarbonato y el vinagre? Curiosamente, ambos productos tienen mayor eficacia por separado. Tanto el bicarbonato como el vinagre tienen aplicaciones prácticas en la limpieza:\nBicarbonato de sodio : su naturaleza alcalina lo hace efectivo para combatir restos de grasa y olores. Al disolverlo en agua, se puede crear una pasta útil para limpiar superficies sin riesgo de dañarlas. Vinagre : el ácido acético es eficaz para eliminar manchas de cal y residuos de agua dura. Calentarlo potencia su efecto en estas tareas.

    "text": "Omar Flores speaks at a June 6, 2024 press conference. Photo by Jeramey Jannene.\nThe Coalition to March on the RNC, a group of 71 organizations focused on opposing the Republican Party’s political agenda, is suing the City of Milwaukee over allegations that the city’s restrictions around demonstrations violate the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n“We have been clear from the beginning that we will march within sight and sound of the Fiserv Forum ,” said coalition co-chair Omar Flores . “As it is our constitutional right to assemble, speak and petition.”\nSpeaking at a press conference Thursday afternoon in front of the U.S. Federal Courthouse, Flores said the coalition has worked in good faith to secure permits, but the city has restricted its access and stifled its rights.\nFlores said the organizers have sought for more than a year to get an approved protest route via a city permit. “We have not heard anything from the city about this route,” said Flores while another organizer held up a route that weaves through Downtown. “What the city has tried to do is get us to agree to something that is less than the full extent of our First Amendment rights.”\nIt now intends to march that route whether it is approved or not. Flores said he hopes police do not interfere, though a portion of the route goes through what is expected to be a credentialed, airport-like security zone secured with fencing.\nThe federal lawsuit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin on behalf of the coalition. It seeks an injunction that would prevent the city’s permitting rules from being in effect and granting the coalition the right to march its route.\nFlores said the lawsuit targets the city instead of the Republican National Convention. “The City is the one that allowed of this to happen,” said Flores. He previously appeared on behalf of the coalition before the Common Council’s Public Works Committee arguing that the city is being too restrictive in its permitting.\nOn Thursday, he said the coalition is disappointed in what it says is a lack of communication. “There is no transparency to what the process is here,” said Flores. “We feel that they need to do their job and listen to the people of the city.”\n“The past two years has been about us trying to engage with the city in good faith about doing this the proper way,” he said. But, Flores said, the city moved the goal posts when it adopted a revised permitting ordinance that established restrictions around the security zone.\nHe said many of the organizers have extensive experience protesting peacefully in tense situations. The situations, said Flores citing Kenosha in 2020, only turned chaotic or violent when police officers moved on protesters. “That’s what we’re trying to avoid by getting this permit,” said Flores. “There is no opportunity through the city to play by the rules.”\nThe city, in a statement from Mayor Cavalier Johnson ‘s communications director Jeff Fleming , says it is abiding by the rules and will contest the lawsuit.\n“The City of Milwaukee is fully prepared to answer the court filings. We have consistently operated in good faith with all the different groups and individuals who are concerned about the demonstration plans. In fact, we have had open discussions and meetings with the litigants in this matter including discussions just hours before the lawsuit was filed,” said Fleming. “ Milwaukee takes seriously its responsibility to provide an opportunity for people to express their opinions. The city is also focused on safety for all the people in and around the upcoming convention. We are working to maximize both those priorities.”\nBut Flores said the city is deliberately delaying releasing the parade route to shorten time for a lawsuit. “This is a pattern we see every four years,” said Flores of other conventions.\nHe said it even happened in Milwaukee in 2020 during the largely virtual Democratic National Convention. “The march was completely family friendly. We marched without a permit and everything went okay.”\nThe Republican National Committee has opposed the city’s intent to use Pere Marquette Park as a free speech zone, saying it is a safety risk given its location next to a likely security checkpoint to access Fiserv Forum. The national committee singled out the coalition as a risk.\n“What the Republicans have put out is that we are seeking to start violence… it’s completely unwarranted,” said Flores. He said the group led a march in 2023 during the Republican presidential primary without issue.\nAdditionally, Flores said the group has no intention of signing up for a time slot at Pere Marquette Park because it views the space as too far from Fiserv Forum.\nThe coalition, said the organization, has agreed on five “points of unity”: standing with Palestine, fighting against the Republicans’ “racist and reactionary agenda,” defending immigrant rights, supporting women’s and LGBTQ reproductive rights and “peace and justice and equity for all.”\n“We want to be as big tent as possible for anyone that opposes the Republican’s agenda,” he said. All of the organizers are volunteers said Flores. He said the coalition expects to see several thousand participants in its march on the first day of the convention, July 15.\nAt a Secret Service press conference Thursday morning , Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle said a detailed security perimeter would be released in approximately two weeks. Fleming said the city would release its decision for a permitted parade route and free speech zone at the same time or shortly thereafter. The Republican National Committee has maintained its opposition to the use of Pere Marquette Park.\nA special meeting of the Common Council’s Public Safety & Health Committee is scheduled for Friday to consider changes to the city ordinance that could prohibit guns and other weapons in the soft security zone around the credentialed area.",

    "text": "What are Palestine’s unique Christmas rituals, disrupted by Israel’s war? This year’s Christmas will have rubble-laden mangers and silent processions amid the war between Israel and Hamas. Through carols, cookies and Christmas lights, December 25 is marked by jubilation and celebration of the birth of Jesus for more than 2 billion Christians worldwide. However, a silent night falls on the 50,000 [Christians in Palestine](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/1/under-israeli-attack-who-are-the-christians-of-gaza) – a number that is in rapid decline.

Israeli forces also [shot and killed](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/17/israeli-forces-kill-two-christian-women-in-cold-blood-inside-gaza-church) an elderly Christian mother and her daughter in a Catholic church in Gaza on Saturday. This year, the many gleeful rituals that characterise Christmas in Palestine will be replaced by simpler ceremonies, mourning and prayer, shining a harsh light on the current reality of the region. The Lutheran Church, for instance, has the Baby Jesus in a [manger of rubble](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/7/if-christ-were-born-today-he-would-be-born-under-rubble-israeli-bombing) and destruction. Was Jesus Palestinian? Many Christian schools of thought believe that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in the now Israeli-occupied West Bank. “Jesus was born on our side of [the wall](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2020/7/8/in-pictures-israels-illegal-separation-wall-still-divides),” Palestinian pastor Reverend Munther Isaac told Al Jazeera. Isaac added that the narrative of the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem is backed by archaeology as well as scripture such as Luke’s Gospel. “It’s the year 2023, and you’ve got, on Christmas day, all over the world, millions of, so many, hundreds of millions, if not more, of Christians going to church, reading about Bethlehem, singing about Bethlehem and thinking maybe of Bethlehem as a mythical place, as a fairytale, not realising it’s a real place with people, with a Christian community that has kept the tradition alive for 2,000 years.” What is the story of Christmas? “While the family of Jesus lived in Nazareth back then, they travelled from Nazareth to Bethlehem for that [census] registration,” Isaac narrated, with thoughtful pauses between his sentences. Isaac drew parallels between the story of the birth of Jesus and the current situation in Palestine. “We’ve always been under empires. We’ve always been displaced,” said Isaac, explaining that Jesus was born when Palestine was under the Roman empire. An imperial decree of the empire ordered the family of Jesus to register for the census in Bethlehem, added Reverend Mitri Raheb, another Palestinian pastor from Bethlehem. King Herod ordered the massacre of infant boys, leading to the family of Jesus escaping to Egypt as refugees, explained Isaac. According to the Bible, Jesus was born in Bethlehem and then placed in a manger. The Church of Nativity was built at this location and its grotto holds great religious significance, pulling Christians from all over the world into the city of Bethlehem every Christmas. The procession of the patriarchs One of the most important Christmas rituals in Palestine is the procession of the patriarch from Jerusalem. This procession takes place on December 24 for Catholics and [January 6](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2018/1/5/why-some-christians-celebrate-christmas-on-january-7) for Orthodox patriarchs. The designated procession route that has been followed throughout the Ottoman Empire and the British mandate is now engraved in tradition, Isaac explained. The patriarch is received from Jerusalem in Bethlehem and then the procession walks through the streets of the old town in Bethlehem until it reaches the Church of Nativity, where prayers are held. Israeli authorities and Palestinian police escort the procession, depending on the territory the procession passes through. The arrival of the procession is a celebrated festivity, welcomed by several scout groups and musical bands from all over Palestine. People leave their homes to walk around the city and witness the spirit of Christmas. This year, the bands and scouts will not be present, instead, the procession will be silent. Midnight mass and Manger Square Once the procession reaches the church, prayers begin at 5pm local time and last until midnight, with the midnight mass being broadcast for the world to see, Raheb said. The Manger Square in Bethlehem is also decorated with a large Christmas tree and performances are held there. This year, there is no Christmas tree at Manger Square. Instead, “the civil society and some artists are working on a new kind of crib that is made out of rubble as a sign to what’s happening in Gaza”, said Raheb. He added that a video will be screened on the wall of the Nativity Church, showing what is happening in Gaza. Shopping, gatherings and Ma’amoul As a child, Isaac would excitedly visit Jerusalem with his parents for Christmas shopping. Several markets sell festive clothes and decorations for the holiday season. It is a tradition to buy the best clothes from Jerusalem and save them for Christmas. “You know how in America you go to a big mall? We used to go to Jerusalem. We can’t any more,” Isaac said, alluding to the stringent [permit rules](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/12/israel-to-open-new-aid-inspection-points-but-no-new-gaza-crosspoints) in the region, which constrict the mobility of Palestinians. Christmas is a time when families meet, in Palestine and elsewhere. While family could mean a small group of immediate relatives in the West, “When I say ‘family’ in Bethlehem, I say all 200 or so members of the Isaac family in our town – the clan,” said Isaac. After an initial large gathering of all family members, individual homes are visited. Feasts of rice and meat are enjoyed and homemade desserts and delicacies are exchanged. These include ka’ek, or ma’amoul – semolina shortbread cookies filled with dates or nuts. Large Christmas trees are a cynosure in every church, where parties and banquets are organised. This year, the parties have been cancelled and “no one is in the mood to … decorate a Christmas tree”, Isaac said. Do Muslims celebrate Christmas in Palestine? Isaac explained that Christmas is a national holiday for all Palestinians, not just a Christian holiday. The Palestinian Authority considers it a national holiday and government offices are typically closed on Christmas day. Several Palestinian Muslims visit Bethlehem on Christmas to attend the parade and take pictures with the Christmas tree. “Jesus was from Bethlehem, after all. And this means a lot to us as Palestinians,” said Isaac.",
