    "text": "Beliebers watch out Is Justin Bieber working on new music?\nVanessa Büchel\n23.1.2025\nIt's been quite a long time since Justin Bieber has released new songs. But the wait could soon be over, dear Beliebers, because the signs indicate that the singer is planning his comeback.\nNo time? blue News summarizes for you\n- Beliebers are holding their breath: Signs point to Justin Bieber possibly releasing new songs in 2025.\n- The singer posted pictures of himself in the recording studio back in October.\n- Now further photos on Instagram suggest that he is working on new songs.\n- Musician Mk.gee also revealed to the New York Times that he has been \"writing and recording\" with Bieber.\nFor Beliebers, 2021 will remain an unforgettable year - because it was the last time Justin Bieber (30) released new music. That was when his album \"Jusice\" was released.\nSince then, it has been musically quiet around the singer. His world tour announced in 2020 also had to be postponed due to the Covid pandemic. But then the concert series fell through completely when Bieber had to put down the microphone for a while for health reasons.\nFor several months now, rumors about a supposed comeback of the pop star have been getting louder and louder. And the musician himself has been fueling them more and more.\nHe recently posted a series of pictures of himself, his friends and his wife Hailey Bieber (28) from their ski vacation in Aspen in the US state of Colorado. Among them is a photo of Bieber that looks suspiciously like he's working on new tracks.\n\"We want your music!\"\nIn any case, his fan base is certain - Bieber's comeback is very close. \"Give me that new album,\" writes one follower. And another says: \"We want your music!\"\nThe 30-year-old uploaded snapshots from the studio back in October. And just recently, followers were able to enjoy possible excerpts of new music in a short Instagram story.\nThe singer has not yet commented on the comeback rumors. However, fans were already saying in October: \"Come back, Justin Bieber!\" Bieber has also teamed up with two big names. He is said to have brought producer Darkchild (47) on board, who is associated with hits such as \"Say My Name\" (1999) by Destiny's Child.\nMk.gee (28) is also said to be at the start. The musician, who has already worked on songs with Drake (38) and Travis Scott (33), revealed in an interview with the \"New York Times\" back in September that, in addition to working on his own music, he has also \"written and recorded\" with Bieber. \"He's on the lookout,\" said Mk.gee.\nTickets suddenly valid again\nAnother incident that fans interpret as a clear indication: Allegedly, many US ticket holders* of his canceled tour received a message that their tickets were valid again.\n[@adrianacassarino_]WHAT DOES THIS MEAN @Justin Bieber[♬ som original - nosense]\nHowever, no fixed date for a concert has been announced. One TikTok user commented: \"I'm crying. Mine too.\" However, most people are convinced that this is a system error.",

    "text": "Gaza Is a Burning Topic for Southeast Asia’s Domestic Politics A distant war has powerful resonance in a region often divided by faith. In Indonesia, a presidential candidate and the foreign minister [addressed](https://www.thejakartapost.com/world/2023/11/05/indonesians-join-interfaith-rally-in-solidarity-with-palestine.html) hundreds of thousands of protestors. In Malaysia, the prime minister, draped in a Palestinian keffiyeh, led his own rally [describing](https://www.reuters.com/world/malaysian-pm-joins-thousands-condemn-israel-western-allies-barbarism-gaza-2023-10-24/) the situation as “insanity” and “the height of barbarism.” In Singapore, the government has simply [banned](https://english.alarabiya.net/News/world/2023/11/07/Singapore-warns-against-public-display-on-Hamas-Israel-war-with-hefty-fines-and-jail) displaying either side’s flag. In Indonesia, a presidential candidate and the foreign minister [addressed](https://www.thejakartapost.com/world/2023/11/05/indonesians-join-interfaith-rally-in-solidarity-with-palestine.html) hundreds of thousands of protestors. In Malaysia, the prime minister, draped in a Palestinian keffiyeh, led his own rally [describing](https://www.reuters.com/world/malaysian-pm-joins-thousands-condemn-israel-western-allies-barbarism-gaza-2023-10-24/) the situation as “insanity” and “the height of barbarism.” In Singapore, the government has simply [banned](https://english.alarabiya.net/News/world/2023/11/07/Singapore-warns-against-public-display-on-Hamas-Israel-war-with-hefty-fines-and-jail) displaying either side’s flag. In Thailand and the Philippines, sympathy for civilian victims competes with anger over Thai and Filipino citizens who have been killed or kidnapped. And in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, the governments have issued carefully neutral statements—even as memories of the countries’ own past experiences of bombing stir. Roughly 42 percent of Southeast Asia’s population is Muslim—and that’s played a key role in the region’s reaction to the Israel-Hamas war. Three broad responses have emerged: Muslim-majority democracies are uncompromisingly critical of Israel, quasi-democracies and democracies with substantial Muslim minorities adopt a more neutral position, and those outright dictatorships with few Muslim citizens are trying to ignore the conflict as much as they can. The Muslim-majority states of Malaysia and Indonesia are unsurprisingly the most fervently pro-Palestinian voices in the region. Both remain among the few countries that have [never recognized](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/international-recognition-of-israel) Israel diplomatically, and the Palestinian cause has long been publicly popular in both countries, used by politicians to burnish their credentials. In the wake of the Abraham Accords, some Israeli diplomats raised the hope that normalization of relations with Indonesia and Malaysia might follow. But the hope was always a thin one, despite [quiet internal discussions](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20210618-israel-ready-to-establish-ties-with-malaysia-indonesia/) by the Indonesian government. Both countries have grown more pious in recent decades—with Palestine proving an important rallying point for Islamic political movements. Outside of Iran, no Muslim leader has taken a harder line on Palestine than Malaysia’s Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who has personally addressed rallies and loudly voiced support for not just Palestinians but also Hamas. Anwar [took a call](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20231017-malaysia-premier-speaks-to-ismail-haniyeh-of-hamas-backs-palestinians/) with Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political bureau, on Oct. 17, and has also [resolutely opposed](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysia-pm-will-not-recognise-unilateral-sanctions-response-us-bill-2023-11-07/) U.S. efforts to ramp up sanctions against Hamas. None of this is surprising. Anwar entered Malaysian politics as a student Islamic activist. His patron (and later rival), former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, frequently castigated Israel and its Western supporters and vociferously supported the Palestinian Liberation Organization. Often this veered into anti-Semitism, with Mahathir [accusing Jews](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25834698?read-now=1&seq=15#page_scan_tab_contents) of controlling the global media and undermining Malaysia’s economy. Popular opinion today remains [virulently anti-Semitic](https://global100.adl.org/country/malaysia/2014) in Malaysia. For Anwar, who leads a coalition supported mainly by ethnic minorities and is struggling to retain support from the Malay Muslim majority, leaning into the Palestine issue is a no-brainer. Yet, the stridency of this support has sometimes placed non-Muslim ethnic minorities in difficult positions, said James Chin, director of the Asia Institute at the University of Tasmania. This is not due to a lack of pro-Palestinian sympathies; ethnic minority politicians have resolutely displayed support for Palestinians. But a proposed Palestine Solidarity Week in schools stirred controversy as pictures of children in schools apparently dressed as Hamas fighters, [complete](https://apnews.com/article/malaysia-palestinian-solidarity-school-guns-1a8f016442b2bad224344237aac269a3) with toy guns, emerged. “The thing that people will worry about is that Solidarity Week will end up as sort of glorifying Hamas,” Chin said. “People worry about the radicalization.” But minority groups’ concerns have put them in the crosshairs of Islamists, who question where the groups’ [sympathies](https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/gaza-conflict-adds-to-the-divisions-in-malaysia) lie. It is exactly this sort of division that Indonesia—which has numerous non-Muslim minorities—is keen to avoid. While Indonesian President Joko Widodo has adopted a lower-key approach than Anwar, public opinion is still universally condemnatory toward Israel. Much attention has focused on the bombing of the Indonesia Hospital in Gaza, which was [built](https://opecfund.org/news/indonesia-hospital-saves-lives-in-gaza) with donations from Indonesia. But the way the conflict is framed has changed in important ways. For decades, the secular-nationalist forces that dominated Indonesian politics framed the conflict in anti-imperialist terms, in the same way the USSR did when it backed Egypt and other Arab states. Overly Islamic, let alone Islamist, politics were seen as a threat to national unity. Islamic understandings of Israel-Palestine only gained traction following the end the Suharto dictatorship in 1998, according to Broto Wardoyo, a Middle East expert at the University of Indonesia. The older view remains influential. In April, Gus Yahya, the executive board chair of Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia’s largest Islamic organization, [argued](https://www.nu.or.id/nasional/gus-yahya-tegaskan-konflik-israel-dan-palestina-masalah-kemanusiaan-bukan-soal-agama-fNnzQ) that the Israel-Palestinian conflict was a humanitarian issue, not a religious war. Since the Oct. 7 attacks, the organization has [issued statements](https://www.nu.or.id/nasional/gus-yahya-tegaskan-konflik-israel-dan-palestina-masalah-kemanusiaan-bukan-soal-agama-fNnzQ) calling on people not to incite hostility on religious grounds. [Clashes](https://magz.tempo.co/read/law/41350/bitung-violent-conflict) on the island of Sulawesi between Islamist groups and an apparently pro-Israeli local evangelical Christian group sparked acute concerns and a swift official response to tamp down tension. Yet, there is undeniably a religious tinge to much of the public response. The massive rally in Jakarta, the capital, was formally [interfaith](https://www.thejakartapost.com/world/2023/11/05/indonesians-join-interfaith-rally-in-solidarity-with-palestine.html). However, with much of the crowd draped in Islamic garb, the religious overtones were hard to miss. Other protests have also been orchestrated by [more hardline religious groups](https://news.detik.com/berita/d-6976537/pa-212-gelar-demo-bela-palestina-di-depan-kedubes-as), which in 2017 coordinated huge rallies against a Christian, Chinese governor [accused](https://news.detik.com/berita/d-6976537/pa-212-gelar-demo-bela-palestina-di-depan-kedubes-as) of blasphemy. On Oct. 31, when Indonesia’s counterterrorism force arrested 59 militants allegedly planning to attack police stations, a taskforce spokesman [warned](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/indonesia-says-arrests-militants-suspected-plotting-disrupt-election-2023-10-31/) that pro-Palestinian protests and fundraising “raise passions to commit terrorist acts.” Surprisingly, Indonesia’s position and concerns are not so far from those of its neighbor Singapore. Unlike Indonesia, Singapore, which has a majority ethnic Chinese population, has [long entertained](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2020-03-16/ty-article/.premium/the-lion-city-and-the-start-up-nation-how-israel-helped-singapore/ 17f-e212-d38f-a57f-e652c0a40000) strong relations with Israel—and even a sneaking sense of solidarity as small, ethnically distinct states in potentially hostile neighborhoods. And the government’s ban on displaying Palestinian or Israeli flags sets it far apart from Indonesian politicians’ tendency to drape themselves in the former. But managing Singapore’s diversity has also always been a key concern. Malay Muslims make up a substantial portion of Singapore’s citizenry and a huge migrant population only adds to the mix. Relations with the country’s Muslim majority neighbors are likewise important. Leading politicians have also [expressed worries](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/israel-hamas-parliament-increase-online-threats-extremist-lawrence-wong-3900326) that Singapore might face increased terror threats dues to its close relationship with Israel. On Nov. 6, Singapore’s parliament took the unusual step of [passing a motion](https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Newsroom/Announcements-and-Highlights/2023/11/20231106-Parl-Sitting) on the Israel-Hamas conflict, symbolically presented by Malay, Indian, and Chinese members of parliament (one from each ethnic group) from the ruling People’s Action Party. Stressing international law, the motion emphasized both Israel’s right to self-defense and the need for Israel to be proportional in its response; it also called for access to humanitarian aid and for Singaporeans not to be divided by foreign political events. Indeed, the rising death toll in Gaza and videos of Israeli bombing on social media appears to be moving public opinion even in traditionally pro-Israeli groups. “There is a domestic reaction, and it cuts across all races and all religions,” said Michelle Teo, executive director of the Middle East Institute at the National University of Singapore. “Still, maybe that’s not a bad thing for us to see in Singapore, because it means people really see themselves as Singaporeans no matter what religion they are.” Worries about internal divisions are also present in Thailand and the Philippines. Both countries have their own Muslim minorities and, unlike Singapore, a history of separatist Islamic terrorism perpetrated by local citizens. In the Philippines, things are at a sensitive point, said Greg Poling, director of the Southeast Asia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The peace process in the island of Mindanao’s Bangsomoro region, where the Moro Muslim people live, has proved successful but is still ongoing; the first local elections since the area was [granted special autonomy](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/03/29/19/my-happiness-is-real-duterte-grateful-for-creation-of-bangsamoro-region) in 2018 were held just last year. “Things went reasonably well,” Poling said of the 2022 elections. “But the last thing [the government] want[s] to see is any sign that the relatively small number of Moros who still remain disaffected are getting new public sympathy.” Despite this, the Philippines was the only Southeast Asian nation to abstain on the recent U.N. resolution calling for an Israel-Hamas ceasefire. The move was widely interpreted as tied to the Philippines’ status as a close ally of the United States, a relationship that the Philippine government is strengthening in response to Chinese pressure. So far, the reaction has been muted, with only a [small protest](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/31/filipino-protesters-slam-govt-abstention-on-israel-gaza-resolution-at-un) in Manila, the capital, against the government’s stance. Domestic attention is mostly directed toward the Filipino foreign workers caught up in the violence. Early reporting in the Philippines focused on four Filipinos who were [killed](https://www.rappler.com/nation/death-toll-filipinos-israel-hamas-war-october-19-2023/), and one believed to have been taken hostage, when Hamas attacked Israel. Now, coverage has shifted to the evacuation of the small number of Filipinos who are residents of Gaza—complicating the narrative. Thailand has suffered even more sharply than the Philippines in this regard. Thirty-four Thai citizens were [killed](https://www.npr.org/2023/11/09/1211191682/thailand-israel-hamas-attack-hostages-farm-workers) and 24 were taken hostage during Hamas’ attack on Israel; many were migrant agricultural workers. All have since been freed, with figures from Thailand’s Muslim minority playing a key role in the negotiations. In keeping with these efforts, the Thai government has mainly taken a carefully neutral stance on the conflict, [reversing](https://thediplomat.com/2023/10/thailands-overlooked-misstep-in-the-israel-gaza-war/) on early comments by Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin that condemned Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks without the usual expressions of sympathy for Palestinians. Public opinion seems less neutral, however. There have been [small pro-Palestinian protests](https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-of-muslims-in-thailand-protest-israel-s-bombing-of-gaza-/7320885.html) domestically. Others, outraged by the deaths, have taken a pro-Israel line—which has sometimes translated into [Islamophobic attacks](https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/Israel-Hamas-war-has-awakened-anti-Muslim-hate-in-Thailand) on the few Palestinian voices in the country, which come from the Muslim minorities. Last in the region come Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. With few geopolitical stakes in wars in the Middle East and—barring Cambodia—no major Muslim minorities to speak of, these countries have mainly issued measured [diplomatic statements](https://www.khmertimeskh.com/501373395/israel-palestine-conflict-cambodia-calls-for-utmost-restraint/) calling for cease-fire and done little else. Public opinion is also hard to read, with the dictatorships that govern these countries unsurprisingly not allowing much public protest. Yet, these countries’ own violent pasts may be [coloring](https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national-politics/cambodia-remains-neutral-israel-hamas-conflict-calls-dialogue) popular perception of the situation. In Vietnam, at least, “there’s quite a bit of empathy for what the people in Gaza are undergoing referencing, especially among older people, their own experience of bombing,” said Murray Hiebert, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “But that was not a political statement, as much as a humanitarian one.” This has even crept into statements by Vietnamese diplomats, who have [invoked](https://tuoitrenews.vn/news/politics/20231029/vietnam-calls-for-end-to-violence-in-gaza-strip-supports-twostate-solution/76451.html) their country’s own past in condemning attacks on civilians and civil infrastructure. Regardless of their exact response, as Israel’s assault on Gaza continues, even countries half a world away can’t quite close their eyes.

    "text": "賣場設置防颱專區 落實民眾自主防颱準備\n（觀傳媒雲嘉南新聞）【記者郭政隆／嘉義市報導】臺灣位處在高災害風險之地區，經常面臨颱風、地震、淹水、土石流及疫災等災害，為因應上述情況發生，民眾應平時就做好各項防災準備，確保災時生命財產安全；經統計，每年7月至9月為「颱風季」，此期間為颱風頻繁來襲之時節，亦為臺灣帶來豐沛的雨量，為避免颱風危害，為使市民事前做好防颱準備，備妥防災食物、防颱用品等項目，內政部協調多家賣場，季節性陳列設置「防颱專區」，推廣落實市民自主防颱準備，讓市民在日常購物之餘，能夠順便檢查並補齊家中所需防颱物資，達成一次購足、防災無憂的目標。\n嘉義市參與設置防颱專區的實體店家包括家樂福、大潤發、好市多、全聯、振宇五金、大九九、小北百貨、大創等百貨商家及統一、全家超商等(季節性陳列)；另有多家網路平台如小北百貨、特力屋、台灣樂天市場等也同步響應，透過多元購物通路，便利民眾迅速完成防颱準備，提升整體社區防災韌性。\n「預為準備，臨事不亂」，強調防災觀念的重要性，在災難尚未發生前，已經做好萬全準備，才能在真正面對挑戰時處變不驚、從容應對；消防局並提醒市民，在颱風來臨前，務必做好下列防颱準備工作：\n1. 備妥三日份食物與緊急避難包。\n2. 檢查住家排水系統通暢避免積水。\n3. 關閉門窗並加強固定措施。\n4. 修剪高大樹木枝葉並加裝支撐。\n5. 戶外花盆移至室內。\n6. 堆放沙包或安裝防水閘門等設施。\n嘉義市政府表示，不斷創新才能維持城市競爭力，這正是驅動城市「再造」的關鍵，而城市的「再造」，也必須「以人為本」，因此，本次防颱專區的設置，不僅是對災害應變能力的提升，更是從民眾生活需求出發，實踐安全、韌性與貼心的城市治理，相關防颱資訊可參考嘉義市防災資訊網，市府也將持續用心守護市民安全，打造讓人安心、住得久、過得好的好城市。",

    "title": "Police officer in Ohio on administrative leave after punching Miami University football player during arrest",
    "text": "(CNN) — An Oxford, Ohio, police officer seen punching a Miami University football player during a November arrest outside a local bar has been placed on administrative leave during an investigation, police say. The student, identified by family as Devin Johnson, entered Brick Street bar through an exit-only gate, pushing past a female employee on November 18, according to a Facebook [post](https://www.facebook.com/oxfordohpolice/posts/pfbid032mH9r1v63YKGbxaDktT6cRojy38SmJkAFwrvYi1N95yogWUjrvQCXrdtDmdi7MQsl) by Oxford police. When the manager of the bar confronted Johnson, he was assaulted, according to police. Johnson then refused to leave the bar and an altercation occurred outside the establishment, the post said. “When the officer arrived at the scene, he observed the individual resisting and he was unable to complete the arrest until additional officers were able to assist in getting him into handcuffs,” the post added. CNN has reached out to police for the incident report and additional comment. Johnson, a 20-year-old defensive back for the Miami RedHawks, was arrested and charged with resisting arrest, assault, criminal trespass and underage intoxication. Johnson has pleaded not guilty to the charges, his attorney told CNN. His case has been set for trial in February, according to court records. In surveillance video circulating on social media, Johnson can be seen outside the bar with several other people. Johnson and one of the men are seen struggling and Johnson is pinned on the ground by at least three people before police arrive. An officer arrives on scene as the people have Johnson on the ground. The officer can be seen attempting to hold Johnson on the ground and appears to punch him three times. They continue to hold Johnson down as another officer arrives on scene. Both officers can be seen forcibly holding Johnson’s head, one of them pulling him by the hair at one point, before placing handcuffs on him. Johnson’s attorney, Ryan Agee, called the video “deeply disturbing” in a statement to the [Miami Student](https://miamistudent.net/article/2023/12/police-restrain-student-brick-street?ct=content_open&cv=cbox_featured) earlier this week. In a Thursday statement to CNN, Agee said, “To date, there has been a concerning lack of communication from the Oxford City Police Department and those conducting the use of force investigation. Given the department’s public statements post-incident and their seeming oversight of critical details, we firmly believe that an independent, external investigation is not only justified but essential to uphold the trust and confidence of the community and the Johnson family in the investigative process.” Addressing the video in a [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/oxfordohpolice/posts/pfbid02JmEo1JoFq9LMpnCxcUMfipdVSy3sUvkv6AJobNZ3E5yXeDvLRCC6CUSExvRjN2t4l) on Monday, Oxford police said their initial investigation “did not include this video angle.” The officer involved in the incident, Matthew Blauvelt, is on paid administrative leave during the investigation, according to Oxford Police Chief John Jones. CNN was unable to reach Blauvelt for comment. A statement from [Miami University](https://www.facebook.com/MiamiUniversity/posts/736322111856888?ref=embed_post) said it was aware of the “disturbing video” and had reached out to the student. The university has also “contacted the City of Oxford to learn more about this incident and to express our deep concerns about what occurred,” it said. Mayor William Snavely said in a statement to CNN, “This is a very unusual and unfortunate event for Oxford. Clearly, the City does not condone excessive use of force. The officer involved has been placed on administrative leave and a full investigation is underway. We intend for that investigation to be fair, transparent, and concluded as soon as possible.” When reached for comment on the incident, a representative from Brick Street said they did not have a comment at this time. In a Tuesday [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1U4u-lPAcv/?hl=en), the establishment said, in part, “The video is disturbing, especially for Devin and family members. We are grateful that Devin and our crowd manager did not require any medical attention and that Devin was released at the police station shortly after the incident. Regardless, it does not change the fact that this portion of the video is disturbing and has evoked emotions.” “We look forward to an opportunity to meet with Devin after the break. These situations can happen in seconds when emotions are high and quickly spiral. Good people can get caught in the middle of unfortunately (sic) circumstances,” it added.

    "text": "Congress storm in offing; will blow away BJP: Kharge [GK NEWS SERVICE](https://m.greaterkashmir.com/author/gk-news-service/145) Jammu, Aug 22: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge Thursday maintained that Congress storm was in offing and it would blow away Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its leadership. He was addressing the convention of party workers and leaders here in Jammu. Bete-noire of his party and its leadership, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was his main target and major portion of his address focussed on criticising his (PM’s) functioning and even his persona. “It’s our party and its leadership, Soniaji, who thought about the Food Safety Act to provide free food to the poor. Congress brought MGNREGA, free education. We brought rail up to Banihal but Modi was taking credit for it. He would not have seen a university yet would claim that he opened universities across the country,” Kharge stated.. “You taught him a good lesson in 2024, he has lost his majority. But see, he is still arrogant – repeating that he has retained power for the third time. Our Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had crossed the 400 mark but never became arrogant. They are arrogant and believe in ‘Jumlabaazi.’ Home Minister (Amit) Shah, during his election campaign here in J&K, had promised to give statehood at the earliest. Did you get it? They did not keep their promise,” Congress president alleged. He criticised BJP leadership besides the (Lieutenant) Governor and to further sharpen his verbal assault, he invoked former J&K Governor S P Malik. “They will be blown away by a Congress storm or say tremors. This happens in quakes or tremors, everything gets lost. It will happen soon. There will be a Congress storm and they will not be visible,” Kharge said. While seeking support of people in assembly elections, he complained – ‘had you given Congress 20-25 seats more, our Rahulji would have been the Prime Minister.’ While referring to lateral entry advertisements and Waqf Bill, he alleged that BJP was harassing all - poor and SCs, and snatching their rights. “Waqf Board bill too was given to the JPC after we robustly opposed it. You have to fight for your rights, with dignity,” he exhorted Jammuites, while describing them as warriors. He asserted that only those working hard would be rewarded in the party. “If assembly elections are won, Modi’s aura will be shrunken further. He will have to bow down and you will get statehood,” Kharge added.",

    "text": "人民财讯7月24日电， 华自科技 7月23日在线上路演交流中表示，锂电业务发展呈现阶段性特征：2020年底至2021年，锂电业务市场爆发，公司新接订单超20亿元；2022年至2024年，受行业竞争加剧影响，订单明显下滑；去年12月以来，受益于新一轮锂电设备更新迭代周期，新增订单明显增加，至目前已新签订单近十亿元，预计下半年还会陆续有订单落地。展望未来，公司认为总体很难再现2021年那样爆发式增长，但由于产线技术迭代，效率提升需求等，订单将持续保持稳定，预计每年会在10亿元左右。\n（文章来源：人民财讯）",

    "text": "Two NDA group employees have been awarded honours by His Majesty the King in the New Year's Honours List, for services to the nuclear industry, young people and their local communities. Michelle Pearse, Nuclear Decommissioning Authority Quality & Business Support Manager, has been awarded a BEM (British Empire Medal) and Peter Buchan, Nuclear Transport Solutions Managing Director of Shipping, has received an MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire). NDA Group Chief Executive David Peattie said: I'm sure colleagues across the NDA group will join me in congratulating Michelle and Pete on this well-deserved recognition, both have made significant contributions to the nuclear industry and society. Our people are our most important asset, and we are proud to have one of the most knowledgeable and experienced nuclear workforces in the world, who go above and beyond for their colleagues and their community, while also continuing to deliver our mission safely, securely and sustainably. Michelle has worked for the NDA since 2005 in a number of roles. The hard work of her whole team, along with her pastoral support, leadership, and empathy, had a huge impact on the NDA being able to return to normal operations at a rapid pace following the start of the pandemic. In addition to her day job, Michelle has also fulfilled a voluntary role with the Changing Lives Learning Trust in West Cumbria since 2012, a not-for-profit charity that manages sponsored secondary and primary academies. Under her guidance as Chair from 2019, the Trust has gone from strength to strength, and this has had a big impact on the educational sector in West Cumbria. Michelle said: I am overwhelmed and delighted on receiving this honour. I can't wait to tell my parents! This has never happened to anyone in our family before so it'll be a lot to take in. The business support team are kind and supportive of each other and they work really hard. I care for them, all of them, including what is happening in their personal lives as that can have a huge impact on them day to day. I am so proud of my work with the Trust, it's very rewarding giving back to the children and the communities they live in. I'm very grateful to the NDA for giving me the space to work with them and develop myself at the same time. Pete's career spans over 32 years and in that time he has played a key role in the NDA group's international business and ensuring the world-wide safe transport and storage of nuclear materials from across the globe. He worked to ensure the largest civilian move of plutonium powder and highly-enriched uranium was safely completed when it was shipped from Japan to the USA. This transport operation was an important milestone in global efforts to secure nuclear materials, and reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation. Speaking of his pride at receiving the honour Pete said: I was shocked when I received the letter and it took a while to sink in as I didn't think I would be worthy of such an award. It's a privilege to work in this industry, and when I think back to joining as a graduate all those years ago, never did I think this would happen to me. I've worked on some fantastic and challenging projects that have made a real difference to global nuclear safety and security, and for this to be recognised at the highest levels is such an honour. This wouldn't have been possible without my brilliant colleagues. Throughout my career I've worked with some of the most dedicated, committed and intelligent people in the industry and I just want to thank them all for their help over the years.
