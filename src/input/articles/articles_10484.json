Log in here »\nOTTAWA – The Assembly of First Nations is not allowing resolutions on child welfare at its coming annual general assembly, including one that called for it to publicly apologize for comments made in front of a tribunal.\nKhelsilem, a chairperson with Squamish Nation, brought forward a resolution related to reforms of Jordan’s Principle, a legal rule that ensures First Nations kids get the care they need when they need it, with payments to be worked out afterward.\nKhelsilem, who goes by a single name, said even though he followed the assembly’s protocol, his resolution was barred from coming to the floor next month.\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau meets with National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak on Parliament Hill, Tuesday, March 5, 2024 in Ottawa. The Assembly of First Nations is not allowing resolutions on child welfare to hit the floor at its upcoming annual general assembly, including one that called for it to publicly apologize for comments made in front of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld “I think it’s very inappropriate by AFN staff in the way that they’ve conducted themselves,” he said.\nThe AFN also barred a resolution moved by Osoyoos Indian Band which called for the AFN to publicly apologize for the “disrespect” shown to First Nations who view the potlatch ceremony as an integral aspect of their culture and sovereignty.\nIn May the AFN argued before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal that it had been “unprecedented” for two kids to access funding through Jordan’s Principle to attend a potlatch ceremony for two deceased relatives.\nPotlatches, which were banned for several decades by the federal government, are commonly held to mark major life events, including funerals. They typically involve feasts as well as spiritual and cultural practices.\nIn a document filed with the tribunal in the case discussing Canada’s non-compliance with Jordan’s Principle, the AFN argued that funding for the ceremony went beyond the scope of what should be allowed.\nIn an email to Khelsilem, the assembly said all resolutions regarding child welfare are being moved to a special chiefs assembly to be held in September, when chiefs are expected to debate and vote on a settlement of more than $20 billion with Canada on reforms to the child welfare system.\nStill, two resolutions made it in to the package, including one that seeks to extend the age of Jordan’s Principle eligibility and another that affirms First Nations can draft and adopt their own child and family services laws.\nSome of the barred resolutions are directly related to the long-term reform agreement, including Khelsilem’s. His resolution would see the AFN secure funding from Canada to hold engagement sessions on the agreement.\nKhelsilem said that if these resolutions aren’t allowed to hit the floor at the assembly in July, they’ll essentially be moot. “They’re denying First Nations leadership the ability to actually discuss that.”\nThe Assembly of First Nations did not immediately respond to a request from The Canadian Press for comment.\nThe AFN told Khelsilem that some of the clauses in the barred resolution were in conflict with previous mandates from chiefs.\nThe AFN did not explain, when he asked, which sections explicitly conflicted with prior resolutions. While the assembly typically helps people fix their resolutions to align with previous mandates, he said the assembly did not do that despite them offering to.\n“The process for engaging with AFN on this resolution has been very disturbing,” he wrote to the assembly in an email Wednesday after the resolution package was posted online.\nTensions have grown between National Chief Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak and some regional chiefs as the AFN gets closer to finalizing a deal with Ottawa on child welfare reforms that will exceed the $20 billion promised as part of the settlement agreement.\nThree regional chiefs, representing British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Quebec-Labrador, said in a letter to Woodhouse Nepinak in early June that the assembly is overstepping its mandate in negotiating reforms with Canada, and that it’s attempting to sideline the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society from the process altogether.\nThe AFN and the caring society jointly launched the human-rights complaint about Ottawa’s chronic underfunding of on-reserve child welfare services that led to the settlement agreement.\nHalf of the $43-billion settlement was earmarked for long-term reforms to the child welfare system across Canada.\nBut the three chiefs told Woodhouse Nepinak in their letter that the AFN has not shared details with First Nations outside of Ontario, and that the assembly has not held meetings on the negotiations since February.\nThey say that limits the ability for chiefs to give free, prior and informed consent on the agreement before it is finalized.\nIn a recent interview, Woodhouse Nepinak said First Nations in Ontario are part of the negotiations so they’re privy to details other jurisdictions may not currently have, and that the assembly is not responsible for the Caring Society’s decision to back out of negotiations.\nThe assembly said chiefs will be provided with the draft agreement before the fall.\nRaymond Shingoose, president of the Caring Society, said he expects child welfare to be a main topic of discussion at the assembly, whether or not resolutions are on the agenda.\n“All we want is free, prior and informed consent, for the regional structures to be followed and the national structures to be followed,” he said in an interview. “What’s so hard about that?”\nWinnipeg Free Press | Newsletter Business Weekly Monday mornings\nThe latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week.\nSign up for Business Weekly Sign Up I agree to the Terms and Conditions, Cookie and Privacy Policies , and CASL agreement . He said without discussions and new mandates on the agreement happening before a vote this fall, chiefs are going to be “blinded” in what they’re approving.\n“Everything is done in secrecy,” he said.\n“To me, the AFN is the new Canada. And it seems to be letting Canada off the hook. We should be negotiating and fighting Canada — not our own people.”\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published June 27, 2024.\nNote to readers: This is a corrected story.

    "title": "Il piano di ristrutturazione di Benetton tra licenziamenti (900) e chiusure dei negozi",
    "text": "La situazione di Benetton resta molto complicata, ma, secondo il nuovo ad Claudio Sforza , il piano di ristrutturazione del gruppo comincia a dare i frutti sperati. I dati della crisi di Benetton Group, tuttavia, parlano chiaro: l’azienda in 10 anni ha perso 1,6 miliardi di euro, con Edizione che ha iniettato 800 milioni di risorse negli ultimi cinque anni. In mezzo un piano di razionalizzazione, la chiusura di punti vendita , le uscite anticipate forzate e i licenziamenti dei lavoratori e un mercato del tessile e dell’abbigliamento che nel periodo 2023-24 ha subito una contrazione del 10,8%.\nLa crisi di Benetton e del settore “Stiamo mettendo in sicurezza l’azienda ma la situazione è ancora difficile. Serve la collaborazione di tutti”, ha detto l’ad di Benetton Claudio Sforza nel suo punto operativo con i sindacati locali del tessile.\nL’alto dirigente, pur non negando il periodo difficile attraversato dal gruppo, ha delineato i prossimi step del piano di ristrutturazione evidenziando anche il contesto assai difficile in cui si muovono tutte le aziende del settore. Riferendosi ai dati resi pubblici dall’ Istat sulla produzione industriale del settore tessile e dell’abbigliamento nel periodo 2023-24, il gruppo Benetton ha fatto sapere che la contrazione è stata “pari al -10,8% su base annua” per l’Italia, con le ripercussioni evidenti su tutte le aziende del settore.\nServe, dunque, ponderare al meglio ogni scelta, con l’ad Sforza che ha sottolineato come “il piano di razionalizzazione” impostato dal gruppo “è stato fondamentale perché consentirà di dimezzare le perdite a fine anno” a circa a 110 milioni . L’obiettivo dichiarato è riuscire ad arrivare al pareggio entro il 2025, con circa 50 milioni di rosso.\nIl piano di ristrutturazione Il piano di ristrutturazione di Benetton è partito dai dati, problematici va detto, del gruppo. Nel corso degli ultimi 10 anni sono stati persi 1,6 miliardi, con Edizione che ha iniettato, solo negli ultimi cinque anni, 800 milioni di euro. Si era arrivati così alla crisi , per uscire dalla quale il percorso dell’ad è strutturato in tre tappe fondamentali:\ndimezzamento a sei mesi per la produzione delle collezioni; sfoltimento degli assortimenti; concentrare in un’unica nuova unità design, marketing e comunicazione. Se, come sperano in Benetton Group, il piano porterà ai risultati sperati, la società potrà tornare a generare entrate di cassa già, forse, da quest’anno.\n900 lavoratori a rischio Ci sono i piani aziendali e ci sono i lavoratori che, inevitabilmente, vivono in questi mesi periodi di grande apprensione per il futuro incerto. Alla fine di febbraio 2025 terminerà il periodo di solidarietà per 900 dipendenti , più o meno l’80% del totale, con l’azienda che ha anche già attivato un piano di uscite anticipate .\nCi sono poi i negozi Benetton sparsi in tutta Italia, con il gruppo che ha avviato una “pulizia” nella rete rivolta soprattutto agli store gestiti da terzi (si cerca il rientro dei crediti scaduti per un totale di 38 milioni) e iniziato a mappare i punti vendita all’estero per comprendere quali siano, realmente, i mercati più profittevoli.\nIn ultimo andrà capito come comportarsi con il marchio Sisley, attualmente integrato, ma non è da escludere che in presenza di un’occasione valida il gruppo possa optare per la sua cessione a terzi.",

    "text": "GREAT FALLS — Viktor Pyshniuk of Lynwood, Washington, was sentenced this week to seven days in jail for thermal trespass at Steamboat Geyser in the Norris Geyser Basin in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). In addition, he was placed on two years of unsupervised release and received a two-year ban from YNP for a closure violation. The court also ordered Pyshniuk to pay a $1,500 fine. Steamboat Geyser is a prominent feature within YNP and the world’s tallest active geyser, and also the most dangerous, according to Yellowstone officials. It has erratic and unpredictable eruptions that can rise anywhere from six to 300 feet high. In the last four years, the intervals between eruptions ranged anywhere from three to 89 days. - Yellowstone: [More thermal-related incidents](https://krtv.org/ThermalYellowstone) Court documents state that on April 19, 2024, a law enforcement officer was dispatched to the thermal area at Steamboat Geyser by an on-duty park employee who reported seeing a person walking off the boardwalk at that location. The employee had taken a photo of 21-year old Pyshniuk, who had clearly crossed over the fence and was walking up the hillside to within 15 to 20 feet of Steamboat Geyser’s steam vent. Pyshniuk told the officer he left the boardwalk to take photos. While talking with Pyshniuk, the officer showed him the signs posted throughout the area stating it is illegal to leave the boardwalk and explained that walking in a thermal area is very dangerous due to possible weak ground layer, the geothermal features of mud pots, heated steam and water, and all other dangers associated with walking in a heated, unpredictable geothermal area. Magistrate Judge Stephanie Hambrick imposed the sentence on June 4, 2024; court documents state that he must serve his sentence by December 25, 2024 at a federal facility as close as possible to Lynnwood, Washington. During sentencing she explained to Pyshniuk that the sentence was designed to deter him, specifically - but also other visitors from leaving the boardwalk in this area. She noted that his actions were seen by the people around him, and they might have thought it was okay to do the same thing, saying that if every visitor to Yellowstone disobeyed the rules, the park would be destroyed, and no one would be able to enjoy it. “Trespassing in closed, thermal areas of Yellowstone National Park is dangerous and harms the natural resource,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Eric Heimann. “In cases like this one where we have strong evidence showing a person has willfully disregarded signs and entered a closed, thermal area, federal prosecutors will seek significant penalties, including jail time.”",

    "text": "A man walks in flood water in Tuscany Region, Italy, Nov 3, 2023. [Photo/Xinhua] ROME -- Italy has experienced a record-setting number of extreme weather events in 2023, a year that is set to be the warmest in more than 150 years, reports said on Thursday.\nAccording to the climate observatory run by the environmental lobby group Legambiente, Italy reported 378 severe weather events in 2023, an increase of 22 percent compared to last year -- ranging from heatwaves to drought and from hailstorms to floods and extreme winds, which were directly responsible for at least 31 deaths.\nOn the other hand, the agriculture sector union Coldiretti said there were more than nine harsh weather events per day this year across Italy's boot-shaped peninsula.\nIn its report, Coldiretti estimated that extreme weather caused a record 6 billion euros ($6.6 billion) of damages to crops and agricultural infrastructure, leading to shortfalls in the country's production of olive oil, peaches, nectarines and wheat.\nLegambiente said its calculations showed that the northern part of the country was hit the hardest, with 210 separate extreme weather events, followed by 98 in the central regions and 70 in the south which includes the island regions of Sicily and Sardinia.\nAmong the extreme weather events were floods, record high temperatures, rain-triggered landslides and hailstorms, it said.\nMuch of Europe suffered a long and dry summer and multiple severe weather events this year, but Italy is often hit harder due to its long coastline and exposure to the sea on two coasts. Meteorological data indicate that this year is set to be the warmest in more than 150 years of record-keeping in Italy.\nMeanwhile, weather agencies predict the year will end with an unusually warm spell, with high daytime temperatures across much of the Italian peninsula, assuring that 2024 will start out on the warm side.",

    "text": "7 Day Forecast Bay Area residents should enjoy the first week of spring and blue skies for now because this weekend it will be back to blustery rain and possible thunderstorms, according to the National Weather Service. Rain and strong winds will begin on Friday and continue through Saturday in all parts of the greater Bay Area – the North, East and South Bay, the Peninsula, and Monterey and Santa Cruz counties – with chances of thunderstorms, the weather service said. Things will taper off on Sunday, though thunderstorms are possible early in the morning and winds will stay strong, with gusts up to 30 mph. Despite the return of precipitation, the weather service has designated the effects of the rain as minor. The rain could accumulate up to 2 inches on parts of the coast by the end of the weekend, but will be between a quarter-inch and 1.5 inches in other regions. People are also reading… Roadways will be wet and downed branches from the wind are also possible, which could mean power outages, according to the weather service.

    "title": "Gobierno se reúne hoy con trabajadores en paro tras primera jornada de movilización y presiones oficialistas",
    "text": "El paro ilegal de trabajadores del sector público que se llevó a cabo ayer descolocó al Gobierno. Es que la manifestación -convocada por la CUT y la ANEF- se realizó a apenas un día de que los representantes de los gremios se reúnan con los ministros de Hacienda, Mario Marcel y del Trabajo, Jeannette Jara, instancia que se concretará hoy.\nLa movilización se realizó a nivel nacional, con marchas y alteraciones en el funcionamiento de los servicios. Santiago fue una de las comunas en donde se notó con fuerza lo que ocurría, pues hubo alteración del tránsito en la Alameda y suspensión de la recolección de desechos domiciliarios, lo que generó una acumulación de alrededor de 580 toneladas de basura.\nLos funcionarios en paro piden un reajuste de 3% real en sus remuneraciones, además de la defensa del empleo público, tras el dictamen de la Contraloría General de la República (CGR) que dejó en manos de los tribunales de justicia la aplicación del principio de confianza legítima en la renovación de las contratas.\nAsimismo, los funcionarios buscan que el Ejecutivo envíe al parlamento el proyecto de ley que reduce la jornada laboral a 40 horas en el sector público.\nGobierno descolocado\nDesde el Gobierno no comprendieron la movilización. Así, al menos, lo dejaron ver los ministros Marcel y Jara esta semana. \"La convocatoria a un paro antes de sentarse a conversar no le encuentro mucho sentido, toda vez que estas conversaciones recién se van a empezar a producir\" , comentó la titular de Trabajo el miércoles, cuando se anunció el paro.\n\"Es difícil de entender\", aseveró, en la misma línea, el ministro de Hacienda . \"Uno puede entender que hay alguna movilización cuando fracasan las negociaciones. Desgraciadamente, en el sector público eso no está regulado, pero igual es como de sentido común que es en esas circunstancias en las cuales se pueden entender las movilizaciones de los trabajadores\", agregó en conversación con Radio ADN.\nDesde la CUT no dejaron pasar las declaraciones del Ejecutivo. \"Nos llama la atención que una ministra (Jara) que fue dirigenta sindical no entienda la movilización, porque cuando hacemos llamados a movilizaciones sociales, es estar en la calle defendiendo los derechos\", señaló el presidente de la entidad, David Acuña.\nAgregó, asimismo, que \"nosotros estamos haciendo algo que es legal para nosotros, poder movilizarnos. No tenemos que pedirles entendimiento ni permiso a los ministros para, como trabajadores, salir a la calle\" .\nDesde la ANEF, en tanto, señalaron que \"hemos sido firmes en rechazar el cambio en el principio de confianza legítima dictado por la contralora Dorothy Pérez, que pone en riesgo la estabilidad laboral de miles de funcionarios públicos que están a contrata y que este 29 de noviembre vivirán una jornada de inseguridad absolutamente evitable\".\nLa movilización de ayer comenzó a las 11 de la mañana y avanzó por la Alameda. Según cifras de la CUT en Santiago más de 30 mil personas participación de la manifestación. Mientras que a nivel nacional habrían sido cerca de 60 mil.\nDesde el oficialismo, en tanto surgieron presiones hacia el Ejecutivo. Esto, porque un grupo de diputados del sector -liderados por Luis Cuello (PC)- ingresó un proyecto de ley que busca abordar la aplicación del principio de confianza legítima.\nEn concreto, la propuesta busca reducir a dos años el plazo para la renovación automática de las contratas, periodo que es menor a los cinco años que determinó la reciente jurisprudencia del máximo tribunal.\nPor ahora, el Gobierno se abstenido de ir contra el último dictamen de la contralora Pérez y avanzar en alguna modificación legal.",
