    "text": "US stock market: The Dow edged to a fresh record Thursday following another sleepy holiday season session as investors get ready to mark big annual gains.\"The last two months have been truly spectacular,\" said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers. \"No institutional investor can afford to be under-invested.\"The Dow Jones Industrial Average put on 0.1 percent to 37,710.10, notching a second straight all-time closing high. The blue-chip index is up almost 14 percent so far for all of 2023.The broad-based S&P 500 climbed less than 0.1 percent to 4,783.35, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index was essentially flat at 15,095.14.Equities have trended higher since late October as the market has embraced moderating inflation and a strong labor market in the belief the US economy can avoid recession.Data from the Department of Labor on Thursday showed a slight increase in unemployment claims. However, the level remains low by historic standards.\"My concern right now is that both stocks and bonds have been rallying so aggressively, we really have to think about the scenarios that would allow this to continue,\" said Sosnick, who noted that bond market predictions of six interest rate cuts in 2024 implies a weaker economy.Among individual companies, Apple advanced 0.2 percent after a federal court on Wednesday suspended a ban on the US sale of its latest watch models.A ban on sales of the watch had briefly gone into effect Tuesday after US President Joe Biden's administration opted not to veto a ruling on the device's patent.Boeing dipped 0.7 percent as the US aviation giant said its 737 MAX aircraft should be inspected to check for loose hardware on plane rudder control systems.The inspection only lasts about two hours, but the issue comes on the heels of other manufacturing and production problems that have slowed MAX deliveries.",

    "title": "Germany achieves record employment: 45.9 million workers in 2023 | Voice of Europe",
    "text": "Despite a stuttering economy and persistent labor shortages, Germany experienced a surge in the number of employed individuals last year, [as reported by Der Spiegel](https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/2023-waren-rund-45-9-millionen-menschen-in-deutschland-erwerbstaetig-a-fcbba15a-2ff5-4f9c-9c8c-28e6f6cad9cb). According to preliminary calculations by the Federal Statistical Office, an average of around 45.9 million people were employed—a record level since the reunification in 1990. This marks an increase of 0.7 percent or 333,000 individuals compared to the previous record year of 2022, even though Germany’s economy contracted, as reported by leading institutions. A key factor contributing to the employment growth in 2023 was the influx of foreign workers, as stated by the Statistical Office. Additionally, a higher labor force participation rate among the domestic population helped overcome the dampening effects of demographic changes on the labor market. Experts anticipate further growth with the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) expecting the number of employed individuals to surpass 46 million this year. By 2025, according to DIW, it could rise to 46.082 million. However, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW) emphasizes that employment might soon reach its peak. The reason for this is given the aging potential workforce, despite expected above-average immigration. The service sectors accounted for the majority of new jobs with an increase of 295,000 individuals or 0.9 percent, reaching around 34.6 million. Substantial growth was observed in the Public Services, Education and the Health sector. Furthermore, in Trade, Transport and Hospitality. In the Manufacturing sector (excluding construction), the number of employed individuals saw a slight increase, while the Construction sector and Agriculture and Forestry recorded declines. The crucial factor for the overall positive trend was the rise in the number of employees by 363,000 or 0.9 percent to 42.1 million, primarily attributed to the positive development of social security-contributing employment. In contrast, the downward trend persisted among the self-employed, including assisting family members with a decrease of 30,000 to 3.9 million.",

They send me everybody’s recommended comp. I go through the whole company. I sort through all 42,000 employees, and 100% of the time I increase the company’s spend on opex.”\n“If you take care of people, everything else takes care of itself,” he added.\nHuang noted that he seeks to pay his workers handsomely, and his strategy has worked well with the company's leadership as well.\n“I've created more billionaires on my management team than any CEO in the world. They're doing just fine. Don't feel sad for anybody at my layer.”\nHuang was pushed to the presigious list of top 10 billionaires in the world following a recent stock surge of Nvidia.\nMeanwhile, Investing.com financial analyst Jesse Cohen shared a survey that revealed that 76-78 per cent Nvidia employees are millionaires.\nSharing a screenshot of a Reddit post on the survey, Cohen said on X, “Wild Stat of the Day: 76-78% of Nvidia employees are now millionaires, with approximately 50% having a net worth over $25 million.”\nThe survey, conducted among 3,000 Nvidia employees, showed that they benefitted from the employee stock purchase programme that allows them to buy Nvidia stocks at a discount of 15 per cent.\nNvidia share price has surged nearly 3,800 per cent since 2019, allowing employees to increase their wealth.\nCatch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.
