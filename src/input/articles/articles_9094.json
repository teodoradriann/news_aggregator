    "text": "[Skip to main content](#main) Emergency responders in the north told CTV News that they are concerned with the number of individuals venturing out onto the ice amid warmer weather conditions. Greater Sudbury Fire Services ' Deputy Chief Jesse Oshell said there have been several calls from concerned citizens over the past 10 to 15 days. Open water on a lake in Greater Sudbury on Dec. 28/23 amidst reports of northerners venturing onto the 'ice' in the the region. (Amanada Hick/CTV News Northern Ontario)\"So concerned citizens are calling emergency services and we do have to attend and we are attempting to speak to these individuals if they are out on to the ice,\" he said. \"We get them back to a safe location and provide education about the ice conditions at this time of year.\" Oshell said the number of calls is concerning so early in the season. \"The ice conditions are concerning, these mild temperatures, although there may be some ice on local waterways, at this time of year any ice should be considered dangerous,\" he said. The deputy fire chief said fortunately, there have been no serious injuries – but added some people have refused help. \"Individuals feel that they have traditionally gone out to the ice on this time of year and it has been safe,\" he said. \"So that messaging or understanding has to change because we are dealing with milder temperatures that are unseasonable for our climate.\" - Download the CTV News app now - Get local breaking news alerts - Daily newsletter with the top local stories emailed to your inbox Stephanie Bakalar, corporate communications officer for the Lifesaving Society told CTV News conditions have been too mild to venture out on the ice. Open water flowing through the ice on Lake Nosbonsing in 2023. (File photo/Eric Taschner/CTV News Northern Ontario)\"What'll happen is you get a bit of freezing and it melts again and creates weak, unstable ice,\" she said. \"It's definitely not suitable for people to be walking on or snowmobiling on. Anything like that. We need solid, thick, clean ice to be doing any activities on.\" Bakalar said ice thickness can be deceiving. \"You actually need a solid four inches of clean ice to be able to walk on and that increases the heavier, more people you have, the heavier vehicles you have,\" she said. The Lifesaving Society estimates 35 per cent of drownings across Canada occur between October and May – most of which are ice or weather-related. Bakalar said these drownings are preventable, emphasizing the messaging 'no ice is safe ice.' Shopping Trends The Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

    "title": "Reacción desde del Senado por el caso Loan: un proyecto busca penas de hasta 15 años por entrega de niños - Infobae",
    "text": "La senadora radical Carolina Losada La comisión de Justicia y Asuntos Penales del Senado, que comanda el legislador libertario Juan Carlos Pagotto (La Rioja), firmó esta tarde los dictámenes de dos iniciativas: una que activa penas de hasta 15 años por entrega de niños, mientras que la segunda declara duelo nacional el 18 de julio, en homenaje a las víctimas del atentado contra la AMIA.\nEl primer proyecto, que es impulsado por la legisladora radical Carolina Losada (Santa Fe) y está atado a la actualidad del caso Loan -el niño que desapareció en Corrientes-, impondrá “ prisión de tres (3) a diez (10) años al que reciba y a quien entregue un niño o niña, haya mediado o no precio, promesa de retribución o cualquier otro tipo de contraprestación ”.\nLa propuesta reprimirá “ con prisión de cinco (5) a quince (15) años quien facilitare, promoviere o de cualquier modo intermediare en la perpetración de los delitos ” relacionados con este tema, que se encuentran en el Código Penal.\nPor otra parte, “el funcionario o empleado público, profesional o personal de la salud, abogado, encargado de la educación o de la guarda de la persona menor de edad, o miembro de organizaciones especializadas en adopción que, en el ejercicio de su actividad, incurriere o participare de cualquier modo en alguna de las conductas previstas en este capítulo, será reprimido con prisión de tres (3) a diez (10) años y se le aplicará la accesoria de inhabilitación especial por el doble del tiempo que el de la condena”.\nAdemás, la escala penal prevista “podrá reducirse en un tercio (1/3) del máximo y en la mitad del mínimo si antes de la iniciación del proceso o durante su sustanciación la persona imputada proporcionare información útil que permita conocer la identidad del que hubiere recibido a una persona menor de edad, intermediado, promovido o facilitado la comisión de este delito, o que permita dar con el parentesco correspondiente a la persona menor de edad”.\nLa sede de la AMIA y sus flamantes murales En los fundamentos, la legisladora santafecina recordó: “Debido a la falta de convocatorias a Sesiones Ordinarias de la anterior gestión de este Honorable Senado -en referencia a Cristina Kirchner- el dictamen conjunto sobre tipificación de ‘compra’ y ‘venta’ de niños acordado con fecha 19/10/22 (S-404/21, S-1232/22 Y PE-106/22. 06-02-2024) caducó por renovación bienal del cuerpo . Se trata de una problemática sumamente grave y aún sigue siendo una gran deuda para nuestra sociedad”.\nDurante la reunión, realizada en el salón Arturo Illia de la Cámara alta, se escucharon algunas advertencias sobre intenciones para modificar el Código Penal de manera exprés y un potencial desfase de penas entre los delitos que trata la iniciativa en comparación con otros más graves .\nEl segundo proyecto dictaminado por la comisión de Justicia declara “ el 18 de julio de cada año como Día de Duelo Nacional, en homenaje a las víctimas del atentado terrorista perpetrado el 18 de julio de 1994 en la sede de la Asociación Israelita Argentina (AMIA) contra la República Argentina ”. Ya fue aprobado por Diputados, por lo que podría quedar sancionado en caso de tratarse en la próxima sesión.\nLa iniciativa establece que el 18 de julio, “ la Bandera Nacional permanecerá izada a media asta en los edificios y lugares públicos” y que “el Ministerio de Educación, mediante el Consejo Federal de Educación, en coordinación con las autoridades educativas de las provincias y la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, dispondrá los medios necesarios a fin de que los establecimientos de educación pública primarios y secundarios de gestión estatal y privada, organicen y desarrollen actividades conmemorativas para dicha fecha ”. Otro punto del texto es que se “invita a las provincias y a la Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires a adoptar similares medidas”.\nSobre un tercer proyecto analizado por la comisión, también empujado por Losada, se determinó la convocatoria a especialistas de cara a los próximos días. “ El que promoviere, facilitare, incitare, indujere o instigare la corrupción de menores de 18 años con fines delictivos, será reprimido con prisión de 3 a 6 años. La pena será de prisión de 6 a 10 años cuando el niño o adolescente fuera menor de 13 años. Cualquiera fuese la edad del menor, la pena será de reclusión o prisión de 10 a 15 años, cuando mediare engaño, violencia, amenaza, abuso de autoridad o cualquier otro medio de intimidación o coerción, o aprovechándose de una situación de vulnerabilidad, o por pago o promesa remuneratoria, como también si el autor fuera ascendiente, hermano, tutor o persona conviviente o encargado de la educación o guarda”, manifiesta su primer artículo.",

    "title": "El Paso bishop defends migrant shelter under attack by Texas attorney general | Crux",
    "text": "From the perspective of the local bishop, the recent effort by the Texas Attorney General to close a Catholic migrant shelter in El Paso shows the impossible situation such organizations are in, balancing federal and state responses with their own mission to serve. “On the one hand, we are challenged by serious federal neglect to provide a safe, orderly and humane response to migration at our southern border,” Bishop Mark Seitz of El Paso said in a Feb. 22 statement. “On the other hand, we are now witnessing an escalating campaign of intimidation, fear and dehumanization in the State of Texas, one characterized by barbed wire, harsh new laws penalizing the act of seeking safety at our border, and the targeting of those who would offer aid as a response of faith,” continued Seitz, who is the U.S. Bishops’ Conference Migration Committee chair. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced his lawsuit against Annunciation House, a migrant shelter that has operated in El Paso since 1978 on Feb. 20. Paxton is seeking to revoke Annunciation House’s registration to operate in the state, citing public records his office has reviewed that show the organization is “engaged in legal violations such as facilitating legal entry to the United States, alien harboring, human smuggling, and operating a stash house.” Annunciation House called the claims “unfounded,” and the attempt “illegal, immoral and anti-faith.” “Annunciation House has kept hundreds of thousands of refugees coming through our city off the streets and given them food,” the organization said in a Feb. 21 statement. “The work helps serve our local businesses, our City, and immigration officials to keep people off the streets and give them a shelter while they come through our community.” “If the work that Annunciation House conducts is illegal – so too is the work of our local hospitals, schools, and food banks,” the organization added. Seitz also defended Annunciation House, saying that it has given an effective and compassionate response to the city’s immigration challenges; a response that is rooted in the Gospel. “Its work is an example of our Catholic commitment to the poor, the Christian call to love one’s neighbor, and stepping into the breach to take action where many will not,” Seitz said. “Our Church, our city and our country owe Annunciation House a deep debt of gratitude.” Seitz also made clear that the efforts of the Church at the border are not political, and instead about responding to the needs of those they encounter. And while he didn’t mention Paxton or the lawsuit directly, he emphasized that the Church will defend those who carry out this work, and not be intimidated. “Let me be clear. For the Church’s part, we will endeavor to work with all in pursuit of the common good of our city and nation,” Seitz said. “We will vigorously defend the freedom of people of faith and goodwill to put deeply held religious convictions into practice.” “We will not be intimidated in our work to serve Jesus Christ in our sisters and brothers fleeing danger and seeking to keep their families together,” Seitz added. “We will stand in solidarity with our community’s aid workers and volunteers, with our community non-profits assisting migrants, as well as with all those in the borderlands and throughout our state living under the weight of inhumane immigration policies.” Follow John Lavenburg on X: @johnlavenburg",
