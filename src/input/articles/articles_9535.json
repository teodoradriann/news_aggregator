    "text": "NSW man dies after contracting Australian bat lyssavirus\nA man bitten by a bat several months ago has died from a horrific virus.\nNSW Health confirmed a man in his 50s died after contracting NSW’s first recorded case of Australian bat lyssavirus.\n“We express our sincere condolences to the man’s family and friends for their tragic loss,” A NSW Health spokesperson said on Thursday afternoon.\n“While it is extremely rare to see a case of Australian bat lyssavirus, there is no effective treatment for it.”\nThe virus, a close relative of the rabies virus, is spread to humans when saliva enters the body through cuts or scratches.\nIt’s been found in species of fruit bats, insect eating microbats and flying foxes.\nA Health Protection director from NSW Health, Keira Glasgow, said it was a “tragic situation” following news the man was battling the virus.\n“The man had been bitten by a bat several months ago and received treatment following the injury,” Ms Glasgow said on Wednesday.\n“Further investigation is underway to understand whether other exposures or factors played a role in his illness.”\nThe tragedy marks the fourth Australian death from the disease since 1996, with the other three deaths occuring in Queensland.\nBat scratches and bites left 118 people in need of medical assistance across the state last year, however this marks the first case of the virus in NSW.\nMs Glasgow warned it was “crucial” for anyone bitten or scratched by bats to urgently seek medical assessment.\n“If you are bitten or scratched by a bat, urgent medical assessment is crucial,” Ms Glasgow said.\n“You will need to wash the wound thoroughly for 15 minutes right away with soap and water and apply an antiseptic with anti-virus action, such as betadine, and allow it to dry.\n“You will then require treatment with rabies immunoglobulin and rabies vaccine.”\nAny bats could carry the life-threatening virus, she warned, with a NSW Health spokesperson urging Aussies to avoid touching or handling the animals.\n“Only wildlife handlers who are trained, protected, and vaccinated should interact with bats,” the spokesperson said.\nOriginally published as NSW man dies after contracting Australian bat lyssavirus",

    "title": "Bookshelf: Atlanta indie author gets national recognition",
    "text": "In this week’s Bookshelf, a local author gets national recognition for her independently published book, book tours are back in business, and a new literary magazine is launched.\nKudos. Congratulations go to Atlanta author Jennie Miller Helderman. Her book “As the Sycamore Grows” (Lucid House Publishing, $19.99) was named among the Best Indie Books of the Year by Kirkus Reviews.\nHelderman spent five years researching this nonfiction account of Ginger McNeil’s escape from an abusive marriage and a survivalist-style living situation raising a family without electricity or a phone. The book grew out of a magazine assignment Helderman was reporting on poverty in rural Alabama.\nBecause of the disturbing topic, “As the Sycamore Grows” is “at times a difficult read,” writes Kirkus, “but the humanity and McNeil’s indomitable spirit shine through.”\nHelderman will discuss the book and sign copies at Eagle Eye Books in Decatur at 2 p.m. Jan. 20. For details go to eagleeyebooks.com.\nAuthors on tour. Now that the holidays are behind us, bookstores are ramping up their author events again. Sure to be a big draw is New York Times bestselling author Rachel Hawkins, making her first appearance at FoxTale Book Shoppe in Woodstock.\nHawkins’ upcoming book, “The Heiress” (St. Martin’s Press, $29), which made the AJC’s list of the most highly anticipated Southern books of winter 2024, is a thriller with Gothic vibes about the wealthiest woman in North Carolina and her adopted son Cam. Although he wants no part of his mother’s riches when she dies, he inherits her estate. In the process of sorting through it, he discovers long-held secrets related to her kidnapping when she was a child and the deaths of her four husbands.\nThe Alabama author’s previous novels include “The Wife Upstairs,” “Reckless Girls” and “The Villa.” She will be at FoxTale at 6:30 p.m. Jan. 10. Book purchase is requested to attend. For details go to foxtalebookshoppe.com .\nGeorgia’s coastline may not be long, but its virgin marshlands are vast and beautiful, unlike the rest of the Eastern Seaboard where marshes were wiped out to make way for development. That’s because 50 years ago, some of Georgia’s most forward-thinking environmentalists, landowners, state legislators and nature lovers came together to create the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act, which ensured the Golden Isles remained golden.\nAuthor Paul Bolster, a former member of the Georgia House of Representatives, chronicles the efforts to pass the act and brings to life the cast of characters who made it happen in “Saving the Georgia Coast” (UGA Press, $22.95). He also examines modern-day challenges that continue to threaten the coast today.\nA Cappella Books presents Bolster in conversation with Megan Desrosiers, president and CEO of One Hundred Miles, a coastal advocacy organization, at the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library at 7 p.m. Jan. 17. For details go to acappellabooks.com.\nBy writers, for writers. The Georgia Writers Museum in Eatonton has launched a new quarterly e-magazine called Page Turner. According to Managing Editor Chip Bell, the magazine targets “new and wannabe authors” with features on Georgia authors, writing advice, book reviews, children’s books and literary events.\nThe magazine debuted in November with a cover story on Townsend Prize winner Sanjeena Sathian, author of the 2021 novel “Gold Diggers.” Contributing writers include George Weinstein, executive director of the Atlanta Writers Club, and Jim Auchmutey, a former AJC reporter and author of “Smoke Lore: A Short History of Barbecue in America.” The new issue is expected to come out in mid-January before the museum’s 2024 Writers Retreat taking place Feb. 24-26. For details go to georgiawritersmuseum.org.\nSuzanne Van Atten is a book critic and contributing editor to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

    "title": "Propósitos de Año Nuevo: ¿Impulso para el éxito o trampa para la frustración?",
    "text": "“Nuevo año, nuevo/a yo”, dicen. Pero, tras el entusiasmo y la euforia de empezar algo nuevo, se puede esconder la frustración. Esto pasa cuando no cumplimos los objetivos que nos trazamos. Allí surge la pregunta: ¿los propósitos de Año Nuevo sirven de impulso o son una trampa social?\nLo cierto es que no hay una respuesta positiva o negativa para esa pregunta. Las metas o propósitos son herramientas poderosas para nuestro crecimiento personal, pero también pueden ser un arma de doble filo si no son planteadas desde un lugar realista. Por ello importa, no sólo cuál es el objetivo a lograr, sino también su planificación y ejecución.\nEn este artículo te explicaremos cómo los propósitos de Año Nuevo pueden ser tanto un impulso para lograr objetivos como también una fuente de frustración. Aquí encontrarás estrategias para transformar esta costumbre de Año Nuevo en un verdadero camino.\nEl Año Nuevo como símbolo de cambio\nCuando cambia el reloj a las 12:00 a. m., el 1° de enero nos ofrece una página en blanco que nos invita a reflexionar sobre lo que queremos para nuestra vida. En este contexto, los propósitos de Año Nuevo se vuelven un canalizador de nuestras aspiraciones.\nDentro de ese contexto, solemos plantearnos metas, unas más ambiciosas que otras. Algunas de las más comunes pueden ser bajar de peso, dejar hábitos dañinos, cambiar de empleo, ahorrar dinero o aprender algo nuevo, viajar, encontrar pareja.\nEstos deseos están respaldados por la motivación que surge al idealizar cómo será nuestra vida una vez que logremos estos objetivos. Además, la presión social juega un papel importante, ya que es común compartir nuestros propósitos con amigos o familiares, lo que nos da una sensación de compromiso.\nNo es mentira que esta motivación inicial puede ser un impulso real hacia la meta, pero también puede desvanecerse rápidamente.\nA pesar de nuestras buenas intenciones, es una realidad que hay quienes abandonan sus propósitos al poco tiempo de establecerlos. Según estudios realizados, alrededor del 70% de los propósitos de Año Nuevo fracasan a los pocos meses. Esto puede ser una fuente de frustración, que a su vez desencadena una sensación de fracaso.\n- Artículo relacionado:\n\"Crecimiento personal: cómo transformar tu vida en 6 pasos\"\n¿Por qué algunas metas de año nuevo fracasan?\nExisten varias razones comunes por las que algunos de los propósitos de año nuevo no se cumplen y generan una sensación de decepción.\nExpectativas poco realistas\nLos propósitos de Año Nuevo pueden ser demasiado ambiciosos o no tener sentido. Por ejemplo, ¿qué tan realista (y sano) es decir: “voy a perder 25 kilos en un mes”?\nEste tipo de objetivos pueden ser no solo difíciles de alcanzar, sino que también pueden generar presión y ansiedad. Estas altas expectativas nos conducen al agotamiento y, eventualmente, al abandono.\nFalta de planificación\nTener un propósito sin un plan concreto es como querer volar un avión sin ser piloto. Si no aterrizamos nuestras metas y las desglosamos en pasos que en verdad se puedan alcanzar, es probable que nos sintamos abrumados y no sepamos por dónde empezar.\n¿Cuál es, entonces, la recomendación? Ser realista ante cualquier resolución que nos planteemos. Y eso no quiere decir que debas cortar tus alas, ¿eh? Puedes soñar en grande y aterrizar tu plan.\n- Quizás te interese:\n\"Automotivación: qué es y cómo potenciarla\"\nPérdida de motivación\nEs fácil sentirse motivado al principio, ¿pero de verdad sabemos cómo mantener esa motivación a lo largo del camino? La verdad es que la cotidianidad de la vida, los imprevistos, los constantes pensamientos intrusivos y la falta de resultados inmediatos son factores que influyen en la pérdida de interés en nuestros objetivos.\nFalta de autoconocimiento\nMuchas veces establecemos propósitos que no están alineados con nuestra realidad y las herramientas que tenemos a nuestro alcance. Por ejemplo, basar nuestras metas en modas o según los objetivos de alguien más puede no ser sostenible o algo que sólo estamos haciendo por influencia de alguien más.\nMiedo al fracaso\nEl miedo a no cumplir nuestras metas puede paralizarnos. Esas metas pueden quedarse solo en pensamientos solo por el miedo de enfrentar los desafíos. Todo con el fin de evitar la sensación de fracaso. Y es entendible, ¿quién quiere sentirse así?, ¡pues, nadie!\nEstos factores hacen que los propósitos que inicialmente parecían emocionantes se conviertan en una carga, y esto genera frustración y desilusión en muchos casos.\n¿Cómo hacer de tu propósito un verdadero impulso?\nLa clave parece estar en adoptar un enfoque más estratégico y consciente. Por eso aquí te dejamos algunas ideas que puedes poner en práctica para transformar los propósitos en verdaderos logros.\n1. Comenzar con metas pequeñas\nEsto no quiere decir que debas minimizar tus objetivos de vida. Sin embargo, es mejor empezar por las cosas pequeñas. Una de las herramientas más efectivas para definir objetivos es el método SMART (por sus siglas en inglés), el acrónimo de los cinco criterios que debe cumplir un objetivo para ser considerado alcanzable. Estos criterios son:\n- Específica: Define claramente qué quieres lograr.\n- Medible: Garantiza que sea posible cuantificar tu avance. *Alcanzable: Sé realista sobre lo que puedes lograr, considerando tus recursos y circunstancias.\n- Relevante: Sincroniza tus objetivos con tus valores y prioridades.\n- Tiempo definido: Establece un plazo para completar tus objetivos.\n2. Divide las metas en pequeños pasos\nUna meta grande puede parecer abrumadora. Pero si la dividimos en pequeños objetivos hace que sea muchísimo más alcanzable. Por ejemplo, si tu propósito es ahorrar una gran suma de dinero, puedes comenzar por apartar una cantidad mensual que no comprometa tus necesidades básicas.\n3. Crea hábitos en lugar de depender de la motivación\nLa motivación es efímera, pero crear hábitos es sostenible en el tiempo. En lugar de depender de la emoción inicial, enfócate en construir rutinas que te acerquen a tus metas. Un ejemplo: si quieres leer más, establece un horario fijo para leer de al menos 15 minutos al día.\n4. Ajusta las metas y ten compasión\nLa vida puede ser impredecible. No pasa nada si toca modificar el objetivo sólo porque las circunstancias cambiaron de forma inesperada, así que recuerda que el hecho de que haya imprevistos en el camino no significa que tengas que abandonar la meta.\n5. Celebra los pequeños logros\nEs importante que reconozcas todo lo que has avanzado, aunque a veces sientas que es muy poco. Celebrar cada victoria te ayudará a mantener la motivación y a reforzar la idea de que sí estás avanzando.\nEl propósito como aprendizaje y crecimiento\n¿Te suena la expresión: “lo importante no es la meta, sino el camino”?. Pues, tal vez creas que es cliché, pero créenos que hay mucha razón en esas palabras. Darle valor al camino recorrido hacía nuestros objetivos es súper clave para lograr alcanzarlos, ya que durante ese tiempo estaremos inmersos en un proceso de aprendizaje y crecimiento personal.\nEs importante recordar que los errores y los fracasos son parte del camino. Cada obstáculo superado nos dejará una enseñanza muy personal. Al establecer nuestros propósitos, es válido preguntarnos: ¿por qué me estoy planteando esta meta? La respuesta nos ayudará a definir objetivos auténticos y sostenibles.\nNo está mal establecer propósitos de Año Nuevo, al contrario, pueden ser un gran impulso positivo en nuestra vida. Sin embargo, lo ideal es hacerlo desde el realismo y la autocompasión. No somos seres perfectos, así que no se trata de alcanzar la perfección, sino de ir un paso a la vez hacia la versión de nosotros mismos que queremos construir.",
