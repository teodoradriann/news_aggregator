    "title": "Afghan interpreter wanted by Taliban granted asylum in Arizona | 12news.com",
    "text": "TUCSON, Ariz. — An interpreter who worked alongside the Marines in Afghanistan for years is now officially an asylee in the United States.\nZabi, who was an Afghan interpreter who fled the Middle East as a refugee, has been waiting to be granted asylum for more than two years.\nZabi worked with the U.S. Marines from 2010 to 2014 as an interpreter. In August 2021, his work with the Marines made him a target of the Taliban.\n'Now, it's like life or death' Help came for Zabi from Darius Amiri, immigration chair at Rose Law Group. The two connected through Amiri's high school friend Corey Mazza, a U.S. Marine, years ago.\n\"I had to get back from Afghanistan. I had to get out,\" Zabi said.\nAmiri previously worked to help Zabi with a special visa that never got approved.\n\"When we did start pulling our troops out, it became imperative that, 'Hey, now it's not just this visa that he needs. Now, it's like life or death.',\" Amiri said.\nRELATED: The war is over: Last US troops leave Afghanistan\nZabi made it to Arizona in the fall of 2021, and Amiri helped get the asylum process started in August 2022.\n\"It's been a long journey,\" Amiri said. The approval finally came in April 2024.\n\"The first days of small Eid, I got my approval, which was like double happiness,\" Zabi said.\nWhen the news came across Amiri's desk, he immediately reached out to Zabi and Mazza.\n\"I thought 'He's joking around with me' because we do joke around sometimes,\" Zabi said. \"When he sent me the photo I was like, 'No he's serious.'\"\n'You feel safe' It's now happiness and safety Zabi said he feels with being officially an asylee.\n\"You feel safe. You feel yourself as part of United States, part of society,\" Zabi said.\nAmiri, who's worked as an immigration attorney for his entire career, said helping with Zabi's case is a career highlight.\n\"We're going to be friends for life,\" Amiri said. \"Our country could use a million more Zabi's.\"\nStill, the process did take two and a half years.\n\"This is all with guidance from the Biden Administration that these cases should be treated as a priority. So outside of the Afghan situation, there's people who are waiting a lot longer,\" Amiri said.\nAmiri says beyond Zabi, they tried to help more people stuck in Afghanistan.\n\"There are people who sacrificed and who made themselves vulnerable by helping us, and we shouldn't turn our backs on them or forget about them just because some time has gone by,\" Amiri said. \"Our government needs to do everything it can to help people who served, who interpreted, who sacrificed for us while we were in Afghanistan, get out and be safe.\"\nZabi lives in Tucson and now works with Lutheran Social Services to help other refugees while he waits for the opportunity to apply for a green card. That can happen within 365 days of his asylum grant. Five years after that, he then can become a U.S. Citizen.\n\"I would love to join U.S. Marines,\" Zabi said.\n\"You can make the argument that our system, our government, abandoned him after everything he did for them, and the fact that he wants to now get legalized, become a citizen and go back and serve more, just tells you everything you need to know about the guy,\" Amiri said.",

El jefe de Ejecutivo federal incluso se dio tiempo para bromear al respecto al señalar que Sheinbaum “sí, me cepilló a mí”. El tabasqueño hizo referencia al número de votos que él logró en el 2018, año en que ganó la presidencia con 30 millones 113 mil 482.

Pese a los resultados, López Obrador llamó a esperar las impugnaciones antes los órganos electorales por parte de sus adversarios, pues aseguró que se niegan a aceptar los resultados. “Hay que esperar porque vienen las impugnaciones. Ayer (miércoles), estaba yo viendo una impugnación y es interesante decirlo porque todavía no quieren aceptar la nueva realidad, ese es un problema que tienen”, refirió. ‘MÁS TERRITORIO QUE ESCRITORIO’: QUIERE AMLO SUPERVISAR OBRAS CON CLAUDIA [López Obrador ](https://www.facebook.com/lopezobrador.org.mx/)señaló que le gustaría salir a revisar las obras con la virtual presidenta electa, [Claudia Sheinbaum](https://www.facebook.com/ClaudiaSheinbaumPardo/), “más territorio que escritorio”. “En mi caso, a mí me gustaría que si salimos juntos sea a ver obras y a supervisar más territorio que escritorio. He hablado con ella, le he mandado recaditos de felicitación, ¿quieren conocerlo? Bueno, el que le mandé el domingo en la noche ¿Lo quieren? A ver si lo tiene Beatriz, mi compañera, mi esposa, un día voy a hablar de ella en la mañanera, la voy a invitar porque me ha ayudado mucho”, detalló.

    "title": "UK Vows to Arm Ukraine For ‘As Long as It Takes’ – Commits $3.7BN Annually",
    "text": "Terms of Service DMCA Advertise with us Affiliates Media Inquiries About Occult & Globalists The UK has committed to what might be called ‘forever aid’ in Ukraine’s defense, with British Foreign Secretary David Cameron newly promising $3.74 billion of annual military aid for Kiev for “as long as it takes”. He unveiled the plan Thursday, and it marks the biggest commitment in foreign defense aid rollout for Britain thus far in the war (and perhaps in all of history), coming on the heels of the Biden administration also seeking to erect a 10-year plan to assist Ukraine which theoretically would lock in future US presidents as well. “We will give 3 billion pounds every year for as long as is necessary. We’ve just really emptied all we can in terms of giving equipment,” Cameron told [Reuters](https://www.newsmax.com/globaltalk/david-cameron-uk-aid/2024/05/02/id/1163311/) in an interview on a visit to the Ukrainian capital. “Some of that [equipment] is actually arriving in Ukraine today, while I’m here,” he said. Alarmingly, he openly stated that the British government has no problem with Ukrainian forces using UK weapons to strike at targets inside Russian territory. “Ukraine has that right. Just as Russia is striking inside Ukraine, you can quite understand why Ukraine feels the need to make sure it’s defending itself,” Cameron said. “It’s absolutely crucial, not just in terms of the weapons it will bring, but also the boost to morale that it will bring to people here in Ukraine,” the UK top diplomat continued in the remarks given upon his second visit to the war-ravaged country as foreign secretary. Cameron was at one point asked whether a potential future Trump administration could negatively impact the flow of aid to the Zelensky government. He responded: “It’s not for us to decide who the Americans choose as their president. We will work with whoever that is.” NATO officials have reportedly been [attempting to](https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/biden-looks-prevent-future-president-ending-ukraine-war-10-year-agreement) “Trump-proof” any future aid. Last Sunday, Zelensky himself signaled as much in a nightly video address, saying that he’s working with Washington on a bilateral security agreement which would last ten years. “We are already working on a specific text,” Zelensky [said](https://www.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-us-working-long-term-181346998.html) in his nightly video address. “Our goal is to make this agreement the strongest of all.” “We are discussing the specific foundations of our security and cooperation. We are also working on fixing specific levels of support for this year and the next 10 years.” He indicated it will likely include agreements on long-term support centering on military hardware and joint arms production, as well as continuing reconstruction aid. “The agreement should be truly exemplary and reflect the strength of American leadership,” Zelensky added. But as we’ve been detailing, Ukraine’s problem currently is not fundamentally a question of funding or weaponry, but of manpower. Soon it may not have enough troops to operate the sophisticated weaponry being shipped in by the West, given the daily bad news from the front lines.

    "text": "Maksim Konstantinov/Global Look Press Казалось бы, отпуск — время для отдыха. Но почему тогда миллионы русских возвращаются из поездок ещё более измотанными? Врачи бьют тревогу: вместо расслабления люди сами загоняют себя в ловушку стресса, переедания и навязанных соцсетями стандартов. Итог — разочарование, усталость и ощущение зря потраченных денег.\nВы мечтали об этом отпуске месяцами. Планировали маршрут, бронировали отели, изучали отзывы. Но вместо долгожданного отдыха получили нервный срыв, переедание и чувство вины за «неидеальный» трип. Врачи подтверждают: русские сами превращают отпуск в дополнительный источник стресса.\nПсихотерапевт Ирина Крашкина предупреждает : многие даже на отдыхе не могут отключиться от работы, продолжая проверять почту и решать служебные вопросы. Вместо восстановления — хроническое напряжение. Но это лишь верхушка айсберга.\nГлавный враг отдыха — погоня за «идеалом». Люди строят настолько плотный график, что к концу поездки валятся с ног. «Нужно успеть всё» — экскурсии, фотосессии, рестораны, пляжи. В итоге — перегруз, усталость и разочарование. А соцсети лишь усугубляют проблему: сравнивая себя с «успешными» отдыхающими, люди начинают чувствовать себя неудачниками.\nНо и это не всё. Диетолог Надежда Литвинова -Гразион обращает внимание на другую ловушку — шведские столы. Бесконтрольное поглощение еды в отелях не только вредит фигуре, но и усиливает стресс. Врач советует «метод тарелки»: 25% — белки, 25% — углеводы, 50% — овощи. Просто? Да. Но кто этим пользуется?\nВывод неутешительный: многие просто не умеют отдыхать. Они либо работают в отпуске, либо устраивают себе марафон активностей, либо заедают стресс тоннами еды. А потом удивляются, почему возвращаются домой разбитыми.\nУважаемые читатели \"Царьграда\"!
