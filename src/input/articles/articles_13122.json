    "title": "OPINION: Banning Russian seafood imports is good for Alaska - Anchorage Daily News",
    "text": "In Alaska, it is well known that “seafood sustains us.” What isn’t as well known is that Alaska seafood also sustains the rest of the United States and the world. Alaska produces nearly two-thirds of our nation’s wild-caught seafood and supplies around 100 countries with seafood worldwide. Supporting our fishing industry is a no-brainer. So, when the seafood industry in Alaska has been under attack for almost a decade by Russia’s lack of sustainable fishing practices and artificially low prices, it is in our best interest as a nation to protect it by enacting policies that penalize the purchase of Russian-origin seafood products and rescinding any certifications issued to Russian fisheries by the Marine Stewardship Council. The first strike against Alaska’s seafood industry came with the Russian embargo in 2014, which expelled Alaska from the Russian market. This left a big hole in our market at the time, but we as Alaskans are resilient and were able to fill that gap with new markets and expand our reach. More recently, the war in Ukraine inflicted another wound and has impaired Alaska’s ability to compete fairly with Russian seafood products on the global market. As the U.S. dollar remains strong, the Russian ruble has plummeted, enabling Russia to sell its seafood at historically low market values and fund its senseless war. This has led to depressed commodity prices and lower values for Alaska seafood. For example, the price of Alaska salmon ex-vessel dropped by more than $300 million in 2023. In March of 2022, the U.S. addressed this problem with a ban on direct imports of Russian seafood; however, that ban was proven to not be enough. Despite our best efforts, Russia continued to profit from the U.S. market through indirect imports of Russian-origin seafood products. In other words, seafood sourced from Russia and processed elsewhere, like China, continued infiltrating the global marketplace. In 2022, the U.S. allowed approximately 70,000 metric tons of Russian-origin cod, salmon and pollock to be imported from China, a total value of $356 million. The European Union recognized this problem and removed fishery products originating in Russia from duty-free treatment or “most-favoured nation” treatment. Now, after years of advocacy from Gov. Mike Dunleavy and Alaska’s congressional delegation, by presidential executive order, Russian seafood will be banned from entering the U.S. — regardless of where it is processed. This was the right decision, as continuing to allow the purchase of Russian-origin seafood not only harms Alaska’s seafood industry but also violates responsible environmental and social governance practices. On a scale from 1-5, one being the best-performing and five being the worst, Russia received a 3.20 in the 2023 Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing Risk Index report. This annual report, published by Poseidon Aquatic Resource Management Limited and the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, measures the degree to which countries are exposed to and effectively combat IUU fishing in their territories. The only other country that performed worse than Russia was China, with a score of 3.69. By continuing to certify Russian and Chinese fisheries, the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) has failed in its duty to “end overfishing and ensure seafood is fished sustainably.” The MSC should reevaluate the criteria used to certify fisheries and stop allowing IUU fisheries with high scores to be certified under its program. These certifications are now misleading to consumers and perpetuate the current skewed playing field in Russia’s favor. Eliminating the import of Russian seafood, by all means, shows the world that the U.S. will not tolerate unjust practices that jeopardize the sustainability of our natural resources and economic prosperity. Aside from these sanctions, it is also time to end MSC certifications for Russian fisheries. Alaska’s seafood sustains Alaska, our nation, and the world. Let’s protect it.

    "text": "Berlin Cannabis Laws\nThe cops will be quite relaxed when it comes to weed. In most cases, they smoke weed! But keep in mind that this depends from cop to cop, person to person. Some cops might be stricter than others, while some might just let you off with a warning. Buy Cannabis Online Germany\nIf you want to smoke in public, it should be fine, as long as you don’t smoke it in the middle of crowded areas or right in front of the cops.\nIn some cases, the cops might confiscate your weed (and they might go on to smoking it themselves later!)\nKeep in mind. If you have more than 60 grams on you, the cops might arrest you, thinking that you are a dealer. Of course, they might arrest you for just a joint too! It depends upon their mood.\nPrices and Quality of Cannabis\nThe prices and even the quality of cannabis differ from spot to spot, dealer to dealer. To put it in simple terms- it’s the dealer’s choice.\nAs for the price, hash is cheaper than weed. You can buy a gram of good quality weed for around $12 . On the other hand, hash- a gram, you will get for about $10.\nWhere can you get cannabis in Berlin ?\nThe best place to find cannabis in Berlin is just to venture out and explore the city. You will inevitably come across many smokers and dealers in parks or on the streets. You can just walk up to someone smoking and ask them. You will also see many shady looking dealers. They will usually approach you if you make eye contact with them.\n. However, in all honesty, this is a terrible deal. You will find low-quality weed, which is sold for high prices, $15 or even more, especially if you are a tourist.\nBuy THC Gummies Australia The weed is awful quality and just not worth it but you be lucky enough to get a dealer with Top quality weed. Buy THC Vape carts Online Germany\nCannabis Culture in Berlin\nWhat you should know is that cannabis/weed/Marijuana and hash are illegal in Berlin, Germany.

Of course, you will need a doctor’s prescription for that!\nFrequently Asked Questions\nIs it safe to get weed in parks?\nUsually, yes, it is safe as long as you stay discreet and don’t act too overt about it. Be careful of the cops around you, and you should be fine.\nCan you smoke hash on the streets?\nWell, you can.

    "text": "VPNs: More Leaky Than a Sieve! So, how many of you thought that paying for a VPN was akin to buying a safe with a six-digit combination? Well, it turns out many of you might as well be stashing your cash in a sock under the bed! A recent study by Top10VPN.com reveals a shocking revelation: over half of the paid Android VPN applications leak user data. Yes, you heard that right—your so-called “secure” VPN is letting the digital world peek into your private life like a nosy neighbor peering through the curtains!\nSimon Migliano, the Head of Research at Top10VPN, conducted a riveting analysis of 30 popular paid VPN apps that have been downloaded a staggering 732 million times (let’s pretend that’s not an incredibly high number of people who are potentially being spied on, shall we?). The findings? A whopping 53% of these services are leaking user data like a sieve—an outcome that’s as comforting as a porcupine in a balloon factory.\nWhat’s Going Wrong? One of the biggest culprits is the notorious failure to implement Server Name Indication (SNI) encryption—a shortcoming found in 50% of the VPNs tested. Folks, this is like leaving your front door wide open and wondering why everyone from the postman to the pizza delivery guy is rifling through your mailbox! As a result, users’ VPN activities are exposed to potential surveillance. Lovely!\nIt doesn’t end there; a staggering 23% of these apps were found leaking DNS requests under certain conditions. Asking for trouble? You bet! It’s important to remember, the same percentage also relied on third-party DNS servers, which is basically like putting your trust in a stranger who promises to keep your secrets—good luck with that!\nRisky Business The research also uncovered that some of these services flaunt risky data practices, with three VPN providers caught sharing or exposing personal data. I mean, come on! “Trust us with your data,” they say, while simultaneously handing it out like Halloween candy. Migliano didn’t mince words; he pointed out that even those who pay for these services might find themselves more exposed than they bargained for!\nNow, don’t close your browser just yet! There is a silver lining. Migliano proudly noted that not a single paid VPN leaked IPv4 or IPv6 data , unlike 11% of free VPN apps. So there’s that. A bit like saying, “Hey! At least your house didn’t burn down when the oven exploded!”\nWhat Can You Do? Migliano urged users to be savvy. “Users often assume that paying for a VPN guarantees robust security and privacy.” Spoiler alert: it doesn’t! The findings suggest you really need to roll up your sleeves (and not just your sleeves—your whole body) to find out what you’re actually signing up for. And quite frankly, if you’re going for a paid service, the last thing you want is for them to inadvertently feature in the new season of “Spying on You: The Tap Your Phone Edition.”\nFinal Thoughts For anyone still on the fence about VPNs, consider this: with data breaches happening left, right, and center, choosing a reliable VPN is crucial. Select one that can ensure your personal information isn’t being paraded around town like the latest influencer gossip. Research, evaluate, and do not just pick the one with the flashiest ad or the most downloads!\nIn conclusion, while there are reliable paid VPN services that can provide some peace of mind, the findings by Top10VPN should serve as a wake-up call for all you internet surfers out there. Choose wisely, or you might as well host a party for hackers in your living room!\nA groundbreaking investigation conducted by Top10VPN.com has uncovered that over half of the paid Android VPN applications are leaking sensitive user data, raising serious concerns about online privacy.\nUnder the leadership of Simon Migliano, Head of Research, Top10VPN.com meticulously analyzed 30 of the most popular paid VPN apps available on the Google Play Store. These applications, which have collectively garnered over 732 million installations worldwide, displayed alarming security vulnerabilities that could put millions of users at risk.\nThe research indicated a staggering 53% of the VPN services tested are leaking user data, thus compromising user confidentiality. A particularly troubling finding was the failure of 50% of these VPNs to implement Server Name Indication (SNI) encryption. This deficiency exposes users’ online activities to potential monitoring by third parties and underscores a critical lapse in security.\nMigliano highlighted that 23% of the examined applications were also leaking DNS requests under certain conditions, further endangering user privacy. This same percentage of VPNs was discovered to utilize third-party DNS servers, increasing the likelihood of external entities tracking user behavior online.\nAlarmingly, the research revealed that three VPN providers were engaging in risky data practices, sharing or exposing sensitive personal data that could severely endanger user privacy. Simon Migliano stated, “Our research indicates that even paid VPN services, which users trust to safeguard their online privacy, are not immune to significant security flaws.” He stressed the concerning fact that half of these services expose VPN usage due to failing to implement adequate SNI encryption, fundamentally undermining the primary purpose of employing a VPN.\nMigliano voiced his astonishment at the prevalence of paid VPN services that outsource DNS resolution to third parties, noting, “A log of their DNS queries can reveal a lot about a person’s interests, political leanings, and any health or financial concerns, and so should be kept private.” This situation highlights a lack of fundamental privacy protections that users expect when using these services.\nIn a more encouraging note, Migliano stated that no paid VPN leaked IPv4 or IPv6 data during the evaluation process, contrasting sharply with 11% of free VPN apps that exhibited such vulnerabilities. “While there’s room for improvement, many paid VPNs are completely safe and far more secure than their free counterparts, almost 90% of which leak data,” he observed, allowing users to maintain a sense of security amidst the alarming findings.\nThe study employed rigorous testing methodologies to assess a myriad of security aspects related to VPN usage. Among the 30 VPNs analyzed, 16 demonstrated some form of data leakage, indicating widespread issues within the industry. Specifically, 15 VPNs allowed exposure of users’ VPN usage owing to the absence of SNI encryption, while seven were noted to leak DNS requests under specific conditions.\nAs part of the study, security standards were thoroughly evaluated, revealing that over a quarter (27%) of the VPNs assessed did not utilize the strongest encryption protocols available. This shortcoming poses significant risks to data security for unsuspecting users. The study pointed to Avira Phantom as the most insecure among the tested VPNs due to its reliance on the outdated SSLv2 protocol.\nThe research drew attention to four VPNs declaring potentially unsafe hardware utilization without justifiable software functionalities, while seven applications incorporated tracking code from advertisers and data brokers. Notably, observed behaviors from VPNs like Hotspot Shield, VPN Unlimited, and FastestVPN showcased active sharing or exposure of personal data, raising additional red flags for consumer trust. FastestVPN stood out as the worst offender, exposing users’ email addresses in the headers of unencrypted server requests to a geolocation API, a severe breach of user confidentiality.\nMigliano remarked, “Users often assume that paying for a VPN guarantees robust security and privacy.” However, he emphasized that consumers must understand these vulnerabilities to make informed choices when selecting a VPN service, dispelling the misconception of absolute security associated with paid options.\n“Our goal is to empower users with the knowledge needed to protect their online privacy effectively,” highlighted Migliano. “By bringing these critical issues to light, we hope to urge VPN providers to strengthen their security measures and earn back the trust that users place in their services.”\nHow can users identify a‌ trustworthy VPN provider to protect their privacy? ⁤ A range of⁢ security flaws.\nInterview with Simon Migliano,​ Head‍ of Research at Top10VPN **Interviewer:** Simon, thank you for joining us today to discuss your recent findings about paid VPN services. It’s quite alarming to ‍hear that over half of these applications are leaking user data. Can you elaborate on what prompted this investigation?\n**Simon Migliano:** Thank you for having me! Our ​team at Top10VPN felt it was crucial to investigate the actual security claims made by various VPN​ providers, especially considering how many users trust these services to ⁢protect their privacy ​online.⁤ With over 732 million installations among the 30 apps we analyzed, we believed it was vital⁢ to determine if these trust relationships were deserved or misplaced.\n**Interviewer:** One of the most troubling aspects of your⁤ findings was the failure of 50% of these VPNs to implement Server Name Indication (SNI) encryption. Why is this significant?\n**Simon Migliano:** SNI encryption is essential because it helps obfuscate users’ online activities from potential ⁣surveillance. When VPN services fail to ⁤use SNI encryption, it’s akin to leaving your front door open for anyone ⁤to walk in and see what you’re ‌doing. This leaves users vulnerable to monitoring and undermines the very purpose of using a VPN for privacy.\n**Interviewer:** You also mentioned that 23% of the apps were leaking DNS requests and relying on third-party DNS servers. What does that mean for user privacy?\n**Simon Migliano:** Great question. DNS requests can reveal a lot about a person’s online ⁤behavior, interests,⁢ and even sensitive issues ⁣like health or political preferences. When VPNs outsource DNS resolution‍ to third⁢ parties, ‍they transfer control⁤ over that sensitive data to entities that may not have users’ best ​interests at heart. This increases the ⁤risk of exposure to external monitoring, which is counterproductive to the privacy protection that users expect from​ VPNs.\n**Interviewer:** Alarmingly, you found that some VPN providers were sharing sensitive personal data. How​ can users ensure they are not falling prey to such practices?\n**Simon Migliano:**⁢ Users need to be diligent. They should read terms of service and privacy policies carefully before signing up. Look ‍for VPNs that are transparent about their data practices and emphasize a ​no-logs policy. Additionally, researching independent reviews and evaluations, like our own, can help users make ‍informed‌ decisions rather than⁢ just ‌relying on marketing claims.\n**Interviewer:** Amidst these alarming revelations, you noted a positive point ​about paid VPNs not leaking IPv4 or ⁣IPv6 data. Can you explain ​why that’s important?\n**Simon Migliano:** Yes, that’s a crucial finding. The fact⁤ that no paid VPN leaked IP data means that these applications have a⁢ better grip ⁣on certain⁤ security aspects compared to free alternatives, where 11% did exhibit such vulnerabilities. ​This indicates that while there are ⁢significant⁤ issues in the paid VPN market, many are taking steps to secure their users’ IP information effectively.\n**Interviewer:** What final message do you have for users ⁢who⁢ rely on VPNs​ for their online privacy?\n**Simon Migliano:** My primary message is that users should ⁤never‍ assume that paying for a VPN guarantees privacy or​ security. It’s essential‌ to ⁤do thorough research, understand the limitations of the ​service, and select a provider that truly prioritizes user privacy. the⁣ responsibility for protecting your online presence lies with you. Choose wisely—your privacy is worth it!\n**Interviewer:** Thank you, Simon, for shedding light on this critical topic. It’s essential information for anyone using or considering a paid VPN service.\n**Simon Migliano:** Thank you for having me! ‌Let’s keep users informed and empowered in this digital landscape.",

    "text": "2024 a été l'année la plus chaude jamais enregistrée en Chine\n(AFP) - L'année 2024 a été la plus chaude jamais enregistrée en Chine, ont annoncé les autorités, sur fond de phénomènes météorologiques extrêmes qui se multiplient dans le monde en raison du changement climatique.\nLe géant asiatique est le premier émetteur mondial de gaz à effet de serre, responsable selon les scientifiques du réchauffement planétaire. Il reste cependant derrière les États-Unis et d'autres pays en termes d'émissions par habitant.\n\"En 2024, la température moyenne nationale était de 10,92 degrés Celsius, soit 1,03 degrés de plus sur un an. Il s'agit de l'année la plus chaude depuis 1961, date du début des relevés d'observation complets\", a indiqué mercredi soir l'Administration météorologique chinoise sur son site internet.\n\"Les quatre dernières années sont les plus chaudes jamais enregistrées. Les 10 années les plus chaudes depuis 1961 se sont toutes produites au 21e siècle\", a-t-elle précisé.\nDans le centre de Pékin, Xu Yici, un employé du secteur de la finance, remarque que ces températures élevées ont déjà affecté l'une des activités hivernales préférées des Pékinois: le patinage sur glace.\n\"Il n'y a pas de glace au Palais d'été. J'avais l'intention d'aller y faire du patin à glace, mais je n'ai pas pu le faire cette année\", explique M. Xu à l'AFP.\nLa Chine avait déjà enregistré en 2024 les mois de juillet et août les plus chauds depuis 1961. Son été a été marqué par des phénomènes météorologiques extrêmes et des vagues de chaleur qui ont frappé une grande partie de ses régions nord et ouest.\nLe changement climatique a déclenché des conditions météorologiques extrêmes et de chaleur record l'an passé, a alerté lundi l'Organisation météorologique mondiale (OMM).\n\"Le gouvernement chinois fait un très bon travail pour protéger l'environnement, donc je ne pense pas que le climat... aura un grand impact sur nous\", affirme à l'AFP Xue Weiya, un informaticien résidant à Pékin.\n- Inondations -\nLe réchauffement mondial, dû en grande partie à l'utilisation de combustibles fossiles, n'est pas seulement une question de hausse des températures, mais a des répercussions importantes en raison de toute la chaleur supplémentaire accumulée dans l'atmosphère et dans les mers.\nUn air plus chaud peut contenir plus de vapeur d'eau, et des océans plus chauds entraînent une plus grande évaporation, ce qui peut conduire à des pluies diluviennes et des tempêtes plus intenses.\nLes répercussions peuvent être importantes, mortelles et sont de plus en plus coûteuses, car elles provoquent des dégâts matériels et détruisent des récoltes.\nEn Chine, plusieurs dizaines de personnes ont été tuées lors d'inondations l'an passé.\nEn mai, des pluies intenses ont provoqué dans le sud du pays l'effondrement d'une autoroute. Le drame a fait 48 morts.\nLes habitants de la ville de Canton (sud) ont connu un été exceptionnellement long en 2024. Selon des médias d'Etat, la température moyenne y a dépassé les 22 degrés pendant 240 jours, battant ainsi le précédent record de 234 jours établi en 1994.\n- Coût astronomique -\nLa Chine, tout comme le reste du globe, fait face à une augmentation significative de ses températures moyennes, entraînant des épisodes de vagues de chaleur, de sécheresse et d'inondations de plus en plus fréquents.\nMais le pays a promis que ses émissions de CO2 connaîtront un pic en 2030 avant d'atteindre la neutralité carbone en 2060. Il développe activement les énergies renouvelables pour atteindre cet objectif.\nEn 2024, des inondations meurtrières ont également ravagé l'Espagne et le Kenya. De multiples tempêtes se sont abattues sur les États-Unis et les Philippines. Une grave sécheresse et des incendies de forêt ont également frappé l'Amérique du Sud.\nLes phénomènes météorologiques extrêmes ont coûté la vie à des milliers de personnes l'année dernière.\nSur le plan économique, les catastrophes naturelles ont causé 310 milliards de dollars de pertes dans le monde, selon une estimation du groupe d'assureurs Swiss Re.",

    "text": "以色列與伊朗進入熱戰，伊朗昨（19）日也預告將要給以色列「大驚喜」，兩國陷入全面戰爭已成定局。亞太商工總會執行長、東海大學經濟系教授邱達生分析，油價及避險資產必定會出現波動。對於美國是否可能參戰，他則認為，考量美國總統川普優先目標朝是穩定物價，判斷會等到 關稅戰 、 國內通膨 塵埃落定，準備充足才可能投入。\n我是廣告 請繼續往下閱讀 據國際油價，布蘭特原油（BRENT）5月低點為每桶58.95美元，經過1個月時間已漲到每桶76.25美元，漲幅近3成。\n邱達生分析，以伊戰爭首當其衝的便是油價，因為全世界約20%的原油都必須要經過荷莫茲海峽，如果伊朗選擇封鎖，那麼中東產油國原油無法輸出，將干擾供給端，導致油價推升。\n假如油價上揚，那麼國際物價又要面臨通膨壓力，原本各國央行都希望從緊縮貨幣政策轉為寬鬆貨幣政策的步調就可能會放緩。\n但他認為，這並非完全無法解決，手段包括美國用影響力逼迫OPEC成員不要減產，維持全世界原油供給；另外就是美國釋出自身的戰略原油，這些都可以讓油價漲勢受到抑制。\n除了油價，邱達生也認為，避險資產會持續走強，譬如黃金等，而現在市場都於美元、美債不具有信心，但這些也都是屬於避險資產之一，因此如果戰爭打響，反而會對於美元信心出現恢復。\n另外，各界對於川普是否可以參與以伊戰爭持續觀望，即便美國國內共和黨部分支持大力反對，川普迄今並沒有明確排除參戰可能性。\n對此，邱達生認為，美國如果若考慮參戰，那就必須要有幾大前提必須完成，包括前述的油價掌控，以及美國國內物價才可能採取更明確動作，也評估川普應該會等到與各國在對等關稅談判塵埃落定後再做決定。\n他解釋，川普一直希望可以回到比較寬鬆貨幣政策，近期也不斷對聯準會（Fed）施壓，如果美國在毫無準備參戰，那只會讓國內通膨黏濁，那就跟上任以來目標不同。\n其次，現在川普正與各國都在打關稅戰，但各界普遍認為關稅戰會拉高通膨，這點也由Fed對外說明，因此川普應該會先優先把物價、關稅戰都處理完畢。\n邱達生評估，美國參戰層面不會太高，如果參戰也會希望早點把戰爭結束，透過快速給伊朗壓力，爭取對方短時間內無條件投降，比較符合川普行事風格，也可以把經濟衝擊壓低。\n更多「 以色列伊朗開戰 」相關新聞。",
