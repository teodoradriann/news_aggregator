    "text": "A celebration of culinary excellence turned sour when over 70 attendees of the L.A. Times 101 Best Restaurants reveal party reported severe gastrointestinal illnesses.The event, which was held at the Hollywood Palladium and featured dishes from top eateries, has now been linked to a norovirus outbreak tied to contaminated oysters, L.A. Taco reported.The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health confirmed that oysters from Fanny Bay Oysters, sourced by Santa Monica Seafood, were likely the cause.The oysters, originating from British Columbia, Canada, have since been recalled.Symptoms experienced by attendees included vomiting, diarrhea, chills and abdominal pain, with some reporting illness lasting several days.Food journalist Javier Cabral described the illness as the \"most horrible food poisoning\" he'd ever endured.The L.A. Times and event organizers emphasized that all vendors met food safety standards but urged affected individuals to report illnesses to aid the investigation.Public health officials continue to probe the outbreak, now part of a broader multi-jurisdictional investigation into contaminated oysters.© Copyright IBTimes 2024.

This phenomenon can then lead to abdominal cramps, a feeling of bloating, constipation and can even make you sick, all factors that can discourage you from eating.\nVIDEO – Dr Christian Recchia: “It is the second most common and deadliest cancer”\nThe second most common cancer\nIntestinal cancer ranks second among the most common cancers. However, there is no need to panic because in 95% of cases, it can be cured if the diagnosis is early, hence the importance of monitoring your body and knowing the different symptoms. As a reminder, one of the most important and common is the presence of blood in the stools.\nALSO READ >> Be careful, this drink can double your risk of bowel cancer\nSo to avoid any unpleasant surprises and complications, it is strongly recommended to be monitored from the age of 50. As Dr Christian Recchia recalled for Yahoo, paraclinical examinations “extremely precise” are indicated from this age, every two years. This makes it possible to observe each part of the intestine and detect the presence or absence of a tumor.\nRead more\nNote that it is possible to reduce the risk of this type of cancer by favoring a healthy diet and physical activity, limiting alcohol consumption and giving up tobacco.\nVIDEO – Why do we lose our appetite when we are in love?\n1703800932\n#symptom #notice #holiday #season",

    "title": "Dublin is safe compared to other western cities, Varadkar insists | Hackney Gazette",
    "text": "Dublin is a safe city when compared with others in the western world, the Taoiseach has insisted. Leo Varadkar said while it is important to acknowledge and listen to the experiences of those who have fallen victim to crime in Dublin, he insisted such incidents are not the norm for Ireland’s capital. There has been an increased focus on safety in Dublin following a series of well publicised random attacks and assaults on people in the city. That scrutiny intensified after the events of November 23, when rioting broke out in the city centre following a knife attack on three young children and their care assistant outside a primary school. Opposition parties claim a reduction in Garda numbers has contributed to a situation where parts of the city are no longer safe. It is a charge the Government has rejected. Mr Varadkar was asked about the issue of safety in Dublin at his end of year media briefing with political journalists. “There’s no city that’s 100% safe,” he said. “If you look at something like the murder rate, for example, in Ireland or Dublin, compare that to other countries or other major cities, you’ll see that Dublin and Ireland are relatively safe relative to other countries and other cities in the western world. “But there’s no place that’s 100% safe and I acknowledge that. What I say to people is that we’re taking actions in all of these areas, increasing Garda numbers and Garda resources, making our laws tougher, with tougher sentences in particular, appointing more judges, expanding our prison places. “(There is) also a big focus now on community safety partnerships, because it can’t be all just about a law and order response. Other things are important too, including things like street lighting, like cameras, like engaging with different services around addiction and mental health and so on. That’s the approach that we’re taking.” Asked how he responded to accounts from individuals who have been assaulted in the capital, the Taoiseach added: “Of course I am concerned about individual negative experiences that people have in Dublin or anywhere else. That’s something you’re very aware of and very exposed to as a politician. “Somebody would have maybe a very bad experience of our health service. But I’m also aware of the counterfactual or the other sides of the story, if you’d like, the huge number of people who have a very positive experience of our health service, for example and say so when surveyed. “The same thing applies to people coming into town, coming into our cities and coming into our country. “Most people, thankfully, don’t experience being victims of violent crime in Dublin or anywhere else. “While it’s really important that we listen to and acknowledge the stories of people who have a very bad experience, we have a responsibility as politicians and journalists not to make the mistake of thinking that bad experiences are the majority or are the norm.”",

    "text": "(AOF) - Les salariés de\n[Boeing](/cotation/BAu) de la région de Seattle, aux Etats-Unis, ont voté hier soir à une très écrasante majorité en faveur d'une grève à partir du vendredi 13 septembre. Cette décision fait suite au rejet de la nouvelle convention proposée par le constructeur aéronautique américain en difficulté. La grève entraînera la fermeture de deux grandes usines d'assemblage d'avions dans la région de Puget Sound (nord-ouest de l'État de Washington). Elle va paralyser la production du 737, du 777 et du 767 cargo, dont les livraisons cumulent déjà les retards.\nSelon ces salariés, l'accord était bien moins généreux que ne l'affirmaient les dirigeants de Boeing. Cette nouvelle convention, qui concerne les adhérents d'IAM-District 751, tablait sur une augmentation salariale de 25% sur quatre ans ainsi qu'un engagement d'investissements dans la région de Seattle.\nBoeing prend acte de cette décision et \"reste déterminé à rétablir ses relations avec ses employés et le syndicat et est prêt à retourner à la table des négociations pour parvenir à un nouvel accord\".\n© 2024 Agence Option Finance (AOF) - Tous droits de reproduction réservés par AOF.

    "text": "“People are no longer able to sleep well at night. In a residential neighbourhood, you will see nightclubs, mosques and churches there making all kinds of noise there. They will tell us they are doing a vigil,” he said. Mr Anya stressed that the town hall meeting was designed to gather input from religious leaders, nightclub and bar owners, and other residents of the state. Master Plan Mr Anya also said the development agency would clamp down on worship centres, nightclubs, and houses built against the state’s existing master plan. He said the Enugu metropolis cuts across three local government areas in the state: Enugu North, Enugu South and Enugu East. The chairperson said the metropolis was almost losing its place as a city because various individuals and bodies frequently violated the state’s master plan. “We have zones in the Enugu metropolis. You can’t establish a church in a residential area. “We will not allow that. We will shut such churches down,” he said. Continuing, Mr Anya said: “Also, in a residential area where people are raising their children, and a nightclub is erected there that starts making noise from 4 p.m. until 6 a.m., we will shut it down.” The chairperson, however, said buildings that were constructed outside the state’s master plan but had government approval would not be shut down. “But we need to talk. We need to agree that you will implement acoustics or soundproofs. We don’t want to hear the sound of your music in another person’s compound,” he explained. He said enforcement of the policy will start on 15 November this year. Religious leaders speak At the town hall, Cadi Ibekwe, a representative of the Christian community, argued that it would be impossible to completely eliminate sound during worship. Mr Ibekwe, a Christian cleric, suggested that the agency should consider specifying the level of sound allowed for churches, mosques and nightclubs rather than outright ban. He appealed to Mr Anya to engage and collaborate with the Christian Community to fashion ways of addressing the concerns before policy enforcement. “I would like to ask for a meeting after this so that we will look at how this policy may affect us,” he said. On his part, Abubakar Sambo, a representative of the Muslim community in the state, said their Islamic faith emphasises the need to consider the rights and peace of others during their daily prayers. Mr Sambo, an Islamic cleric, assured the meeting of the Muslim community’s resolve to restrict sounds being generated during their prayers. “During the course of discussion with some Islamic leaders, we were made to understand that, as Muslims, it is our duty to regulate the sound within our prayer premises so that we will not encroach into the rights and peace of our neighbours and that we have applied in Enugu State,” he said.

    "text": "陈劭扬 | 大学预科班 原本就是教育制度的不公\n大马教育文凭考试（SPM）A-不是A的风波延续至今，究其原因，并非是A不A的问题，也不是首相安华为了扩大蛋糕，导致僧多粥少的问题，而是必须明白，为何成绩优等生，挤破头都要进入大学预科班（Matrikulasi），抢占进入大学的先机。\n从我求学时代起，进“Matri”弃“Form 6”就已经是莘莘学子的主流想法，特别是对于家境普通，但成绩优秀的学生，即便明知只有10%名额的机会，多数人都不想放过这条被视为升学捷径的方案。\nADVERTISEMENT\n反之，中六向来都是被视为最后的妥协，是“Matri”落选后的退而求其次，但问题是，当越来越多学生选择所谓的“捷径”，留下来继续拼读中六的学生，反而成了“另类”，对这些学生公平吗？\n中六，也就是STPM，是国家考试系统的一部分，前后要读一年半，早期考试非常难，后来经过整改后，考试评估改为学期制，采用与预科班相同的制度，但无可否认，考试依然压力大，即便获得满分，也不一定申请到理想大学和科系。\n反观大学预科班，由大学自己设立课程，一年时间就可毕业，考进去的学生，只要不是不及格，几乎保送大学，对于非巫裔学生而言，有运气拼抢到的名额，自然格外珍惜，因此读上预科班的华印裔生，满分成绩比比皆是。\n我们会误以为，读上预科班的都是满分学生，但其实，成绩中等的学生也有不少，但这些学生却因为受到特别照顾，拥有让中六生羡慕的升大学优先权。\n归根究底，如今最大的问题，不是“A-不是A”的问题，而是两者的门槛、入学机会从一开始就根本不对等。\n比如，STPM学生要拼死拼活读上18个月，即使考到满分，还不一定能拿到自己想要的大学课程，反而预科生只要顺利完成那一年的课程，即便无法选上自己的目标大学，但保底也可以拿到自己所要的课程。\n别忘了，随着时代变化，如今升学管道多样化，除了面对预科班的竞争，中六生也要面对私人大学开办的预科课程、剑桥A水平考试，再加上大学直接招生。\n只要是家境可以负担，如今很多学子都是“绕过”STPM这条辛苦路，但对于那些家境普通的学生，他们多数的选择只能是中六，因为这是免费，也是国家提供的升学通道。\n可是，当他们读得那么辛苦，成绩又好，却还输给用“更容易制度”升上大学的学生时，那种无力感，谁又能体会，这不仅是不公平，还会打击学生信心。\n对于华裔生，许多学生中五毕业后，都会产生一种观点，即STPM很难、升学机会低，还不如直接跳过，放弃国立大学，拉曼理工学院拥有如此多的华裔生，都是教育制度的失衡所造成。\n而且，这种观念越来越走向主流，近几年来，愿意报读中六的学生已经越来越少，没人会愿意花费更多时间，争取原本就很微小的升学机会，即便可以升学，往往都是被派到冷门到都不曾听过的学科。\n教育的目的，应该是让所有人，不管家庭背景，都能靠努力改变命运，但如今这个双轨制，不仅变成了一条“捷径”，更是成为了“制度化的特权”。\n不是说大学预科班不应该存在，只是它在整个教育体系中，已经占据了太多优势资源，反而把中六这条原本为全民设计的路，逐渐被边缘化。\n读书拼命，应该值得被尊重，不是让努力的人输给制度，在一个公平的社会里，努力应该得到回报，而不是让努力输给捷径！\nADVERTISEMENT\n热门新闻\n百格视频\nADVERTISEMENT",
