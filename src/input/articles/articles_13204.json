    "text": "El Salvador’s President Fires 300 Culture Ministry Employees for 'Incompatible Agendas' El Salvador President Nayib Bukele announced plans to fire 300 culture ministry employees, claiming their agendas conflicted with the government’s vision. Bukele, while aiming to save public funds, has faced criticism for restricting civil rights and canceling cultural events. The move aligns with his administration's emphasis on patriotic and family values. [Reuters](/reuters-stories)| Updated: 28-06-2024 03:39 IST | Created: 28-06-2024 03:39 IST El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said on Thursday that the culture ministry would fire 300 employees who he said were promoting agendas \"incompatible\" with the government's vision. \"Furthermore, we will save public funds in the process,\" Bukele said on X. \"Bitter medicine.\" Bukele did not elaborate. But last week he appointed Raul Castillo, a former teacher, as culture minister, saying that he wanted to \"promote patriotic and family values.\" Ruling party lawmaker Alexia Rivas wrote on X shortly after Bukele's post: \"El Salvador is pro-life, pro-traditional family and the 2030 agenda has no place here,\" an apparent reference to the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda which includes provisions for a range of human rights. \"This is what the people asked for, this is the vision of our president, and this is the path that officials must follow,\" she said. El Salvador maintains some of the world's harshest anti-abortion laws, while earlier this month, the culture ministry canceled a play by drag artists after receiving complaints from local conservative and religious groups. Bukele took office at the start of June for a second term after winning a landslide re-election, pledging to cure the \"illnesses\" of the Central American country by prescribing \"medicine\" to fix the economy, following what he described as a cure for the \"cancer of the gangs\" during his first term. Bukele garnered massive popularity for transforming security in a country that was once one of the world's most dangerous, but use of mass trials, a mega prison and suspended civil rights have drawn criticism from human rights groups. A former marketing professional, Bukele has created a powerful communications operation that has allowed him to influence what Salvadorans read, watch and hear about their government like no previous leader in the nation of 6.5 million people in the internet age. Critics say Bukele's media juggernaut is helping to undermine the country's fragile democratic institutions.

[ANI](/ani-stories)| Updated: 29-12-2023 15:00 IST | Created: 29-12-2023 15:00 IST - Country: - India Reacting to the opposition rejecting invitations for the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple, Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami said that people refusing to attend the temple inauguration never wanted the Ram temple to be constructed. Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami said, \"Everyone waited for a long time for the Ram Temple, and under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi, this has been possible. People from around the world will be able to witness this historic moment. I am also one of them. All the Ram devotees are anxiously waiting for the moment.\" On Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut's allegation that the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh has abducted Lord Ram he said that it was useless to expect anything from the opposition. \"People refusing to attend the inauguration never wanted the Ram temple to be constructed. The Congress party, which is leading the INDIA bloc especially Kapil Sibal have tried their best to obstruct the path towards the construction of the Ram temple. It is useless to expect anything from them,\" he added. As per temple officials, the consecration ceremony will be held over a span of seven days starting on January 16. On January 16, the host appointed by the temple trust, Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra, will conduct the atonement ceremony. The 'Dashvidh' bath, Vishnu worship, and offering to cows will be held on the banks of the Saryu River. Following that, on January 17, a procession carrying the idol of Lord Ram in his child-like form (Ram Lalla) will reach Ayodhya. Devotees carrying Saryu water in Mangal Kalash will be reaching the Ram Janmabhoomi temple. On January 18, formal rituals will kick off with the Ganesh Ambika puja, Varun puja, Matrika puja, Brahmin Varan, and Vastu Puja. On January 19, the holy fire will be lit, followed by the establishment of 'Navagraha' and a 'havan' (holy ritual surrounding the fire). The sanctum sanctorum of the Ram Janmabhoomi temple will be washed with Saryu water on January 20, after which the Vaastu Shanti and 'Annadhivas' rituals will take place. On January 21, the Ram Lalla idol will be bathed in 125 urns and will finally be laid to rest. On the final day, January 22, after the morning puja, the deity of Ram Lala will be consecrated in 'Mrigashira Nakshatra' in the afternoon. The Bharatiya Janata Party has decided to run a campaign for Ram Mandir celebrations starting January 1, in which BJP workers will go door to door in all the villages across the country and encourage ten crore families to participate in Diya Lightning programs for Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address attendees at the grand consecration event from the front of the 'Singh Dwar'. According to sources, lakhs of devotees are likely to pour into the temple town for the grand occasion.

    "text": "Tecnología\nEl aparato que aumenta el consumo eléctrico si lo usa en la mañana\nUsar los aparatos eléctricos se vuelve una herramienta indispensable para el ahorro y la sostenibilidad.\nEl consumo de energía eléctrica en el hogar es un tema que cada vez genera más preocupación, especialmente ante el aumento de las tarifas en diversos países y el impacto ambiental asociado al uso excesivo de electricidad. Uno de los aparatos más comunes en los hogares, y cuyo uso en horarios específicos puede disparar el consumo energético, es el calentador de agua eléctrico. Usarlo en la mañana, cuando la demanda de energía es más alta, puede incrementar significativamente los costos en la factura mensual.\nSegún un análisis realizado por la inteligencia artificial de ChatGPT, [uno de los electrodomésticos que más energía consume en las primeras horas de la mañana es el calentador de agua eléctrico](https://www.elpais.com.co/tecnologia/el-peor-momento-del-dia-para-usar-el-microondas-podria-desbordar-el-costo-de-la-factura-de-luz-2058.html), indispensable en muchos hogares para realizar actividades básicas como ducharse, lavar platos o la ropa. Sin embargo, este aparato es uno de los mayores consumidores de energía, especialmente durante las primeras horas del día.\nEn la mañana, debido a la alta demanda energética de otros electrodomésticos, como cafeteras, microondas y planchas, el sistema eléctrico tiende a saturarse, lo que puede ocasionar picos en las tarifas en zonas con sistemas de facturación por horas.\nLos calentadores eléctricos trabajan de manera constante para mantener el agua a una temperatura elevada. Si se encienden en la mañana, cuando ya hay un alto consumo por parte de otros usuarios en la red eléctrica, [el aparato requiere más energía para alcanzar la temperatura deseada, lo que resulta en un consumo mayor al habitual.](https://www.elpais.com.co/como-hacer/los-electrodomesticos-que-no-se-deben-dejar-enchufados-en-las-noches-para-ahorrar-energia-2216.html)\nUn informe de eficiencia energética publicado por diversos organismos ambientales y empresas eléctricas señala que este fenómeno no solo afecta la economía de los hogares, sino que también tiene un impacto negativo en el medioambiente, ya que la mayor demanda suele estar respaldada por fuentes de energía menos sostenibles.\n¿Por qué las mañanas son problemáticas?\nLa razón detrás del incremento del consumo energético al usar el calentador en la mañana tiene que ver con los patrones de uso colectivo. En la mayoría de los hogares, la actividad comienza al amanecer, y los electrodomésticos se encienden de manera simultánea. [Desde las 6:00 hasta las 9:00 de la mañana, se registra uno de los picos más altos en la red eléctrica, lo que genera una sobrecarga y, en algunos casos, una elevación del costo del kilovatio/hora.](https://www.elpais.com.co/como-hacer/este-electrodomestico-de-uso-diario-podria-estar-causando-muertes-prematuras-0731.html)\nEn países donde se utiliza el sistema de “tarifas horarias”, el costo de la electricidad varía según la demanda. Esto significa que utilizar electrodomésticos como el calentador de agua en horas pico puede salir significativamente más caro que hacerlo en horarios de menor uso, como la tarde o la noche.\nAdemás, hay factores internos que también contribuyen al mayor gasto en las mañanas. Durante este periodo, el agua que ingresa al sistema suele estar más fría debido a las bajas temperaturas nocturnas, lo que obliga al calentador a trabajar más intensamente para elevar su temperatura, incrementando aún más el consumo energético.",

    "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin (right) speaks with Rostec CEO Sergey Chemezov during their meeting in Moscow, Russia, 28 December 2023. (Photo: EPA-EFE / GAVRIIL GRIGOROV / SPUTNIK / KREMLIN) By Bloomberg 0 Ukraine’s premier sounded the alarm over the country’s finances, requesting an emergency meeting with international donors as Kyiv confronts ‘exceptionally high uncertainty’ over its budget at the start of the year. The Biden administration announced on Wednesday $250-million in weapons and equipment for Ukraine, its final package for the year, as officials press Congress to renew aid in the new year.\nThe head of Russia’s Rostec said its arms unit had boosted the output of tanks and armoured vehicles for the military as the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine approaches its third year.\nRussia has sufficient budget funds to pay for its war in Ukraine, according to Finance Minister Anton Siluanov.\nUkraine sounds alarm over finances Ukraine’s premier sounded the alarm over the country’s finances, requesting an emergency meeting with international donors as Kyiv confronts “exceptionally high uncertainty” over its budget at the start of the year.\nIn a letter to a key coordination group overseeing funds, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said financing was needed next month and should be channelled to Ukraine’s core budget needs. The message reinforces Ukrainian pleas with more than $110-billion in financial aid being held up by political infighting in the US and the European Union.\n“To uphold macroeconomic stability, it is imperative that we receive sufficient, prompt, and predictable external financing, beginning January 2024,” Shmyhal said in a letter sent this month to the Multi-Agency Donor Coordination Panel (MDCP) and seen by Bloomberg News.\nThe sense of urgency is mounting in Kyiv as Russian President Vladimir Putin exploits wavering support among Ukraine’s allies and a 2023 counteroffensive that failed to achieve its aims. Ukraine’s Finance Ministry last week said financing needs for 2024 stand at $37.3-billion, after receiving more than $42-billion in foreign aid in 2023.\nThe prime minister said the MDCP, which was set up by Group of Seven leaders in December 2022 to coordinate international funding, should focus on immediate budget needs — keeping the government running with payments for teachers, civil servants and pensions — rather than its longer-term mandate to coordinate resources for reconstruction and economic recovery from the war.\n“It is hardly possible to hold any discussion about recovery and rebuilding projects, when we struggle fulfilling the 2024 survival priorities,” Shmyhal said in the letter. Donors should hold a meeting in January ahead of a scheduled meeting the following month, he said.\n“We cannot wait till March to finance our social needs,” the premier said. Ukraine’s budget may be hit by shortfalls as early as the first two months of next year, Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko said earlier this month.\nIt was unclear how recipients responded to the letter or whether they agreed to a meeting sooner.\nUS legislators this month abandoned efforts to reach a deal for more than $60-billion in funding for Ukraine before leaving Washington for the holiday break. The assistance is being held up by Republican lawmakers demanding more restrictive border and immigration policies.\nAn EU package worth €50-billion for Ukraine was blocked by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán this month, sending the debate into early next year.\nGermany expects EU deal on Ukraine aid, even without Hungary Germany expects European Union member states to pass their next Ukraine support package either way, even if Hungary should continue to block a unanimous decision.\nEU leaders have been looking for ways to get around Budapest’s intransigence after talks over the €50-billion package for the government in Kyiv broke down at a summit in mid-December.\nA potential backup option that has been floated is having member states funnel money to Kyiv outside of the EU budget process, an option Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán signalled may be viable.\nThe proposal would involve national guarantees from member states to raise funding in the markets should Hungary continue to block the review of the EU’s long-term budget at an extraordinary summit on 1 February.\nSpeaking at a regular government news conference in Berlin, Foreign Ministry spokesman Christian Wagner said Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s coalition government would provide military support for Ukraine worth €8-billion in 2024 and Berlin would continue to “campaign vigorously” for the adoption of the bigger EU aid package worth €50-billion early next year.\nUS provides $250m in Ukraine arms in last package for the year The Biden administration announced on Wednesday $250-million in weapons and equipment for Ukraine, its final package for the year, as officials press Congress to renew aid in the new year.\n“Our assistance has been critical to supporting our Ukrainian partners as they defend their country and their freedom against Russia’s aggression,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. “It is imperative that Congress act swiftly, as soon as possible, to advance our national security interests by helping Ukraine defend itself and secure its future.”\nThe package, drawn from Pentagon stocks, includes ammunition for artillery and air defence systems as well as anti-armour munitions and more than 15 million rounds of small arms ammunition. The Defense Department said in a press release that Javelin anti-tank systems and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles would be among the weapons offered.\nAccording to the administration, the US has provided about $44.3-billion in military assistance since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nRostec chief tells Putin Russia is boosting tanks output for war The head of Russia’s Rostec said its arms unit had boosted the output of tanks and armoured vehicles for the military as the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine approaches its third year.\nTank production increased seven-fold in two years, Rostec Chief Executive Officer Sergey Chemezov told Putin on Thursday in televised comments, without giving figures.\nOutput of armoured vehicles grew more than fivefold, and production of ammunition ranging from small arms to artillery shells grew as much as 50 times, said Chemezov, who’s under US and European sanctions for his role in the war.\nRussia plans a sharp increase in defence spending next year to 10.8 trillion roubles ($119.8-billion), up by almost 70% compared with this year.\nRussia has enough budget funds to pay for war – finance minister Russia has sufficient budget funds to pay for its war in Ukraine, according to Finance Minister Anton Siluanov.\n“The Finance Ministry provided all the funds required for the main tasks” of the military, Siluanov told reporters in a briefing on Wednesday. “All the needs of our armed forces for their tasks in the special military operation are provided with money.”\nRussian petroleum exports decline as diesel, naphtha flows ease Russia’s oil-product exports dropped on a weekly basis, led by a slump in shipments of diesel, naphtha and fuel oil.\nThe more volatile weekly flows for the period through 24 December slipped to 2.5 million barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from analytics firm Vortexa. That was about 666,000 barrels down from the revised figure for the period to 17 December.\nHowever, the four-week average climbed to the highest in more than seven months amid a ramp-up in oil processing at Russian refineries. Oil-product flows from the nation reached 2.6 million barrels a day in the four weeks to December 24, up by 157,000 barrels a day from the previous week. DM\n ",

Pelo Instagram, o ator compartilhou um vídeo e um texto: \"Fiz, refiz vários vídeos nossos pra postar hoje nesse seu dia, mas achei melhor postar só esse mesmo que mostra todo seu sorriso, toda sua grandeza e brilho. Quero começar esse texto agradecendo antes de tudo pelo nosso amor, pela nossa união, hoje casados, mas muito antes disso com muita amizade, respeito, admiração, carinho, amor, e sempre liberdade. Nos escolhemos até aqui, escolhemos casar, escolhemos viver todos os dias juntos e assim será pro resto dessa e de outras vidas. Obrigado por esse amor leve e tranquilo, obrigado por fazer eu ser um homem melhor, um ser humano melhor\", escreveu. Frambach continuou a declaração: \"Você imagina o quão eu te admiro e te amo, mas te dou certeza que você não imagina o QUANTO eu te admiro e te amo, o QUANTO eu tenho a certeza da mulher GIGANTE que você é. Infelizmente vivemos em uma sociedade em que as escolhas das mulheres são sempre relacionadas ao homem que está do lado, sempre subestimadas, e reduzidas a sua escolha amorosa, então pra essas pessoas eu só posso desejar mais amor porque só a falta de amor verdadeiro justifica tantas frases absurdas que vemos e ouvimos\". E seguiu: \"Eu te amo meu amor, parabéns pelo seu aniversário, parabéns pelo seu dia, parabéns por todas as conquistas e batalhas que superou nesse ano e em todos os outros que passaram e em todos os outros que ainda virão! Saiba que você tem antes de tudo um amigo, um admirador, do seu ser, e por isso tudo, hoje sou também o seu marido! Eu te amo muito meu sorvetinho, minha vida!\", desejou. Como esperado, Larissa agradeceu o carinho do marido e comentou: \"Já tô chorando. Meu presente! Minha escolha! Te amo muito. Obrigada por ser meu companheiro nessa vida! Que sorte que eu dei! Que seja sempre assim, cheio de amor. VAMOS VIVER\".",

A ideia é que seja feita aos poucos, com alíquotas diferenciadas a partir do ano que vem.",
