    "text": "Livestock welfare is a shared responsibility What you need to know: - In Uganda, livestock are vital members of our communities enriching our cultural heritage and bestowing on us immediate economic benefits on top of providing us with food, manure, and industrial raw materials. - NARO’s livestock research focuses among other aspects, on technologies, innovations, and management practices that improve livestock feed efficiency for milk production, optimal growth rates in beef, and overall freedom of livestock from distress while ensuring that livestock undergo positive experiences. Every October 4th, the world commemorates the World Animal Day. This year the theme is , “The world is their home too,” shinning a spotlight on the challenges facing animals and the animal welfare movement world over. This year’s theme is a great inspiration building onto last year’s theme “Great or small, love them all” and inspires us to further recognize that animals including livestock are sentient with the capacity to feel pain, pleasure, and happiness and that they too can enjoy the world. In Uganda, livestock are vital members of our communities enriching our cultural heritage and bestowing on us immediate economic benefits on top of providing us with food, manure, and industrial raw materials. We can’t stress enough that livestock are a strong component of Uganda’s economy supporting 6.5 million households who depend on livestock for their livelihood and contributing about 6-7 percent of the GDP and hence ought to be seen as our partners in building a prosperous, healthy, well-nourished country. However, animal welfare has not been picked as a crucial aspect of animal husbandry in the country largely because of the inadequacy of information or the weakness of animal protection laws that are by and large almost impossible to enforce in their current form. Many a time, the mental and physical well-being of livestock are abused by exposing them to extreme distress like we often see in their inhumane transportation, improper-inadequate feeding, severely unsafe and uncomfortable animal housing, and general exposure to disease risk. Animals whose owners don’t take into consideration their rights and welfare are often prone to diseases that expose them to negative experiences and lower their productivity causing losses to their owners and the country at large. Through research at the National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) in areas such as breeding, disease control, and feed optimization, sustainable farming practices are being developed to benefit both animals and farmers. For instance, the development of anti-aflatoxin technology and vaccine production capacity aims at not only reducing animal disease risk but also ensuring the freedom of livestock from pain and discomfort. Also, NARO’s livestock research focuses among other aspects, on technologies, innovations, and management practices that improve livestock feed efficiency for milk production, optimal growth rates in beef, and overall freedom of livestock from distress while ensuring that livestock undergo positive experiences. More is yet to be done especially with partnerships among stakeholders who ought to resolve as one to ensure that livestock welfare is embedded in all livestock production systems. For it is important to note that sustainable livestock farming is not just about increasing yields but creating a balanced system where animals thrive and that simple practices such as feeding the right rations in proper amounts, and proper housing can drastically improve livestock welfare, which without doubt, is a sure road to sustainable livestock farming. As we celebrate the 2024 World Animal Day, I yearn to see farmers, researchers, policymakers, and the public come together to advocate for the welfare of livestock. Ensuring that the world is their home too means taking collective responsibility to provide animals with the care, respect, and protection from harm they deserve. This involves among other measures; increased investment in research, better farmer access to extension and veterinary services, and the enforcement of animal protection laws. Let us use this day not just to reflect on the challenges but also to commit to actions that will improve the mental and physical well-being of livestock under our care. The author Dr. Solomon Emergo Kiggundu, is a Veterinary Doctor at NARO’s National Livestock Resources Research Institute (NaLIRRI)",

    "title": "Gypsy Rose Blanchard shares first photo after being released from prison early - Mirror Online",
    "text": "For the first time since her early release from prison, Gypsy Rose Blanchard took to her Instagram account to post a selfie — captioning it simply: \"First selfie of freedom!\"\nThe snap shows her wearing the same white and blue shirt with a front pocket and stylishly ripped and woven arms she wore on Thursday as she went shoe shopping with her husband, Ryan Scott Anderson, at an Off Broadway Shoe Warehouse near Kansas City, Missouri. She's also wearing the same jeans.\nShe smiles as she holds up her rose gold iPhone and places her other hand on her hip, her wedding ring visible. Her hair is in a messy but cute ponytail that's draped over her left shoulder, with two strands of hair streaming down the sides of her face.\nREAD MORE: Gypsy Rose Blanchard's life after prison as mum murderer set to be unlikely celeb\nGypsy appears to be in a hotel room — likely the same one she crashed in at the Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott in Chillicothe, Missouri, a tiny city located about 90 miles (145km) northeast of Kansas City. Chillicothe is the same city near which the Chillicothe Correctional Center is located, the place Gypsy was imprisoned for around eight years before she was set free on parole on Thursday.\nBehind her, a suitcase sits on the floor near the pristinely made bed, which seems to also have a suitcase on it. Another one sits on the floor beside it. All appear to be packed with clothes and other essentials.\nThere is also a pack of Dr Pepper on the floor near the hanging racks, where her husband's large blue shirt hangs next to another that's tan in colour.\nFor all the latest news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US\nPosted around 8.30am local time on Friday, the snap has already garnered almost 100,000 likes and hundreds of comments. Many of them are supportive, praising her look, her smile or simply offering their support for the famous felon, who was convicted of second-degree murder after she orchestrated the killing of her medically abusive mother, Clauddine (Dee Dee) Blanchard.\n\"We’ve been waiting years for this for you!! Wishing you a lifetime of comfort love and all the joy you can find <333,\" wrote user @littlebunnybigday. That comment achieved over 700 likes. \"2024 is your year! And we’re all rooting for you,\" wrote @thekevinlivingston, while @aplasticplant simply wrote \"w\" — a sort of GenZ slang that's an abbreviation for \"win.\"\nGypsy was imprisoned for orchestrating the murder of her mother in 2015 after suffering over two decades of medical abuse at her hands, which eventually turned into violent domestic abuse as Gypsy began to figure out what was happening.\nDee Dee suffered from factitious disorder imposed on another, formerly known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy, which meant that she would make up or exaggerate the illnesses she said her daughter had, fooling doctors, family members, the community and even charities, which doled out large sums of money for Gypsy's treatments and care.\nAt the age of just three months, Gypsy was diagnosed with sleep apnea after her mother took her to the doctor when she was having breathing problems. She was given a breathing apparatus, but the medical maladies only increased from there.\nDee Dee was convinced that there was something else wrong with her daughter, and she eventually told family and convinced medical professionals that she had a chromosomal disorder that meant she wouldn't develop at the same rate as other children and that she would be cognitively impaired, too.\nThat \"diagnosis\" relegated Gypsy to a wheelchair, but more maladies kept coming. Her mother told others that she had leukaemia, then started shaving her head to mimic the impact of chemotherapy treatments. She also made up that she had epilepsy, convincing doctors to prescribe Gypsy medication that she didn't need, which made her teeth crumble and fall out.\nWhen the height of all these issues was happening, when Gypsy was just 7 or so, she and her mom moved to Louisiana, shocking the family, who just wanted to help poor Gypsy as she endured such horrific medical \"diagnoses.\"\nThen, Hurricane Katrina rolled in and destroyed their home in 2005, which prompted them to move to Missouri, where charities paid to have a home built for them, complete with wheelchair ramps and a hot tub in the back.\nDee Dee reportedly couldn't work because caring for Gypsy was a full-time job in and of itself. The donations kept pouring in, and the seemingly inseparable pair would win trips to Disney for free.\nWhen they were out together, Dee Dee would hold Gypsy's hand consistently, but it wasn't out of love — it was a method of controlling her, as Dee Dee would squeeze Gypsy's hand hard whenever she feared her daughter would spill the beans on their secret, which was that Gypsy wasn't actually ill.\nEventually, Gypsy met Nicholas Godejohn online, and the two struck up a relationship, chatting using fake Facebook accounts so Gypsy's overprotective mother wouldn't find out. They met at a showing of Cinderella at a movie theatre and had sex in the bathroom, and then later, when Dee Dee did discover their relationship and smashed up Gypsy's computer, they managed to stay in touch, and she conscripted him to help her kill her mother.\nGypsy let Nicholas into the house, and he stabbed Dee Dee 17 times in the back with a serrated knife, and then the two fled to Wisconsin, where Nicholas is from. They made posts to her mother's Facebook page, but they were traced back to Wisconsin, and the couple was arrested.\nGypsy was handed 10 years for second-degree murder and was paroled after around eight on Thursday this week. Nicholas was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\nNow, Gypsy has aspirations of a public speaking career and of meeting Taylor Swift at the upcoming Kansas City Chiefs game on New Year's Eve against the Cincinnati Bengals. She plans to live her life to the fullest as a free woman.",

    "text": "No matter how many difficulties there may be in life, there is so much more left\nin which one can draw the meaning of life, and strength, and even the joy of life.\nNatalia Frederiks\nBaroness Natalia Frederiks was born on July 8, 1864, at her ancestral estate of Znamenovka in the Bakhmut district of the Ekaterinoslav Governorate (now Donetsk Oblast) on the feast of the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God. She was the daughter of a hereditary nobleman, Imperial Army Colonel Modest Alexandrovich Frederiks,\n1 and Countess Elizaveta Alexandrovna, nee Geiden. Natalia had one brother, Baron Nikolai Modestovich Frederiks, a lieutenant in the Egersky Guards Regiment.\nThe Frederiks baronial family was known in Russia since the eighteenth century. The ancestor of Baron Modest Alexandrovich, Ivan Yurievich Frederiks, was a court banker of Empress Catherine II, who, for his honest service, was granted the title of baron on August 5, 1773. Natalia's grandmother, Countess Anna Alexandrovna Geiden, in 1898 helped build a church dedicated to the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the village of Petrovka-2, located near the Znamenovka estate. She also donated fifty desyatins (130 acres) of land for the maintenance of the church. Possibly the village of Znamenovka itself belonged to her, where later Natalia's parents built a brick factory.\nBaron Modest Frederiks' family lived in St. Petersburg, where Natalia graduated from the Mariinsky (Foundry) Gymnasium. It was the first mixed-social-status female educational institution in the country. Girls studied for seven years, during which they received comprehensive knowledge. Unlike other institutes, the students lived at home, within their families.\nAfter the death of her parents, Natalia Modestovna inherited the village of Znamenovka and 3000 desyatins of land. Later, she also acquired a house-estate in Yalta. Natalia was wealthy but lived very modestly, dedicating much of her time to philanthropy. In 1895, she became a member of the St. Petersburg Cross Charitable Society and was on its board of directors. The society was established by representatives of the Petersburg nobility to aid all those in need, regardless of rank, gender, age, or creed. It provided the destitute with clothing, food, shelter, medicine, and, in extreme cases, financial support. It placed the elderly in shelters and almshouses and allocated funds for the education of children.\nIn her estate, Natalia Modestovna built a hospital and an elementary school for peasant children, and organized festivities for peasants. She was reserved by nature and loved solitude. Her brother, Nikolai Modestovich, died in 1892 at the age of thirty, leaving a widow with two children. Natalia was very close to her sister-in-law, Elena Iliodorovna Frederiks (born Shidlovskaya), and helped her raise her nephews, Dmitry and Vladimir. Natalia herself never married. She usually spent winters in St. Petersburg and summers either in Znamenovka or in Crimea. Living on her estate, she read much, painted watercolor sketches, planted flowers and trees, and managed the estate. This continued for many years until her tranquil life was disrupted by the outbreak of the First World War.\nAt the onset of the war, Natalia Frederiks enrolled in nursing courses. For a while, she worked as a surgical nurse at the Tsarskoye Selo Palace Hospital, then went to the front as a Sister of Mercy in the sanitary-nutritional train named after\nGrand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna as part of the 4th Army. For her devoted work, on November 9, 1915, Natalia was awarded the Silver Medal “For Diligence” on a distinguished ribbon. Having witnessed all the horrors of war, she turned to God in repentance and secretly took monastic vows. 2\nAfter the\nrevolution, Natalia Modestovna remained in Russia while her other relatives emigrated. Apparently, she lived on her estate in Znamenovka until it was expropriated by the new regime. She herself stated that the revolution “freed her from property ownership.” Natalia Modestovna returned to Petrograd and in early 1919 began working as a librarian at the Pedagogical Institute for Preschool Education, where she worked until July 1919. She led a modest and secluded life, attending church services.\nShe was first arrested on July 11, 1919, as a former baroness, and by a resolution of the Petrograd Cheka on November 7, 1919, she was “sent with her case to the All-Russian Cheka 24/U11-19 for imprisonment in the Moscow camp.” After spending six months in a camp near Moscow, she was released in February 1920. From the fall of 1920 until the end of 1922, she worked again as a librarian at the same institute but was dismissed due to staff reduction. Left without any means of subsistence, the former wealthy landowner earned a living by giving private lessons to children.\nUntil February 1924, Natalia Modestovna was a member of the parish council of the St. Sergius Cathedral on Liteyny Prospekt in Petrograd, where she sold prosphora. She was also a member of the Orthodox Charitable Brotherhood of the All-Merciful Savior (Spassky Brotherhood). The Spassky Brotherhood organized food and clothing aid for those held in the prison infirmary on Pereyaslavskaya Street, as well as a free canteen where sixty to a hundred people were fed daily. In the spring of 1922, arrests of the Brotherhood’s members began across the country.\nOn February 3, 1924, Natalia Modestovna was arrested “for active church activity in the parish.” She was held in pretrial detention in the Special Purpose Prison (DPZ) “of the first category.”\nDuring interrogations, in order to avoid implicating relatives and friends, the former baroness stated:\n“I have no close relatives... I have no acquaintances with whom I constantly associate. I am very occupied with work at the St. Sergius Cathedral, and therefore, I do not go anywhere, and no one comes to see me.”\nRegarding her attitude toward the authorities:\n“I am indifferent to the Soviet government. However, I am thankful for the revolution as it freed me from property and secular obligations, which would have been a challenge for me to renounce.”\nRegarding her political beliefs:\n“I have none because I am a religious person, and politics do not exist for me.”\nDuring one interrogation, she testified about herself:\n“Until 1913, I had little connection with the Church as I was not particularly religious. But since 1913, I increasingly strengthened my spiritual faith... Now I have fully devoted myself to the Church.”\nFrom February 3, 1924, until September 26, when the final sentence was issued, Natalia Modestovna was in the Preliminary Detention House on Shpalernaya Street in Petrograd. The second arrest ended with her being sent to\nSolovki: On September 26, 1924, by a Special Council at the OGPU Collegium, Natalia Modestovna Frederiks was sentenced to two years in the SLON (“Solovki Camp of Special Direction”) concentration camp, where she arrived on October 25, 1924.\nThe main types of women's work in Solovki included laundry work, rope-making, peat extraction, and work at a brick factory located two kilometers from the monastery. “Brick-making” (molding and carrying clay) was considered the most challenging. The sixty-year-old baroness struggled immensely with the “brick-making”; she was involved in molding clay—unbearable work for her age. The criminal inmates mocked her: “Hey, baroness! Lady! This is not like dragging the Tsarina’s train! Work like us!”\n3 They constantly ridiculed her, attempting to humiliate her in every possible way.\nThe internal life of the women's barracks was a hell, where an aristocrat found herself among prostitutes, criminals, smugglers, and brothel madames. Among the inmates were noblewomen who kept to themselves, conversing in French. Natalia did not get close to any of them.\nEvery evening, after returning from hard work in the barracks, Natalia Modestovna silently ate a bowl of codfish stew, then knelt before a small icon and prayed for a long time. After carefully tidying her clothes and shoes, she lay down to sleep on a neatly arranged bunk. It's known that a person’s true essence manifests itself during tough times. The saintly ascetic Natalia bore all the hardships of camp life with humility, considering her fate as a cross sent to her that must be carried without complaint or tears in an atmosphere of foul language, fights, and mockery. She treated both criminals and women from her own circle with equal friendliness, seeing the divine image in each person. She carried herself with a sense of dignity but never lectured or displayed superiority over others. An aristocrat in the truest sense, she remained noble, pure, and possessed high moral qualities.\nNatalia Modestovna became greatly weakened while working in the brick factory, so she was transferred to the role of supervisor for the children of the camp leaders. As the sorrowful days on Solovki passed by, attacks on the Baroness became rarer day by day. Gradually, the attitude of the other inmates towards Baroness Frederiks changed significantly. Seeing her self-control, honest work, and kindness, they began to respect her and sought her advice. Due to her cleanliness, she was unanimously elected to the honorary position of barrack cleaner, which included washing the floors and tending the stove. Her personal record noted: “Handles assigned duties well and conscientiously, behavior is excellent, disciplined”; the overall review mentioned: “Exemplary behavior, good work”; and in the disciplinary action section: “No incidents”.\nThe spiritual influence of Baroness Frederiks on her fellow inmates grew stronger. With her love, inner culture, and sense of duty, she transformed human souls, leading some to faith. During\nHoly Week in 1925, under Natalia Modestovna's influence, five female prisoners from her barracks, including herself, confessed and received Communion from a camp priest, whom brave inmates secretly brought into the Solovki theater building and hid in the costume room. The priest administered the Holy Gifts in a secluded corner.\nChaos erupted on the Solovki Islands a year later when a typhus epidemic broke out, and a typhus ward was set up on the remote Anzer Island. Medical staff were scarce, as no one wanted to tend to typhus patients, knowing it was akin to a death sentence. The camp administration turned to the prisoners for help. Baroness Frederiks was the first to volunteer to care for the sick prisoners. Several of her fellow inmates followed suit. Because of her experience as a Sister of Mercy, she was appointed as the senior nurse in the quarantine ward. She cared for the typhus patients lying on the floor, clearing away dirty sawdust and filth from beneath them. Solovki prisoner Anna Sergeevna Arsenyeva recalled:\n“The winter of 1925/26 brought many victims. In December, the first reports of those affected by abdominal typhus emerged. The elderly Baroness F. and I requested permission to care for the sick, and upon receiving it, we went to the typhus isolation ward. The Baroness and I didn't have a single free moment. At night, one of us, fully dressed, would sleep while the other kept watch. We had to work tirelessly. Lice against which we were utterly powerless crawled over our hands and the walls. Only one woman was assigned to help us; she washed the floors and dishes. Apart from her, no one assisted us in this difficult and dangerous task. Every three hours, we had to rinse the patients’ throats with a glycerin solution to prevent ulcers. Some resisted, not comprehending in their delirium why they needed it. They would push us away with cries and fists, refusing our aid... Bishop Agapit, our first patient, recovered and was transferred back to his cell in stable condition. He often visited us, and when the camp was asleep, he sneaked into the infirmary to comfort the dying and absolve them of their sins.\"\nWhen signs of illness appeared in Natalia Modestovna, the head of the medical unit urged her to move to a separate room, but she declined, saying, \"Why bother? You know that at my age, one doesn't recover from typhus. The Lord is calling me to Himself, but for two or three more days, I can still serve Him.\"\nHer service continued for two more days; on March 30, Natalia Modestovna died while attending to the sick. Before her death, Bishop Agapit administered to her the Holy Mysteries of Christ.\nBaroness Natalia, having died from typhus, was buried in a common grave at the former monastery cemetery, located not far from the women's barracks. It was destroyed in the 1930s, and a military hospital was built in its place.\nOn November 14, 1981, by the Hierarchical Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia (ROCOR), Nun Natalia of Solovki was glorified among the host of new martyrs and confessors of the Russian Church. Her memory is celebrated on March 30—the day of her repose. In 1991, Natalia Modestovna Frederiks was officially rehabilitated by the Prosecutor's Office of St. Petersburg. On May 14, 2019, a solemn opening ceremony was held for a memorial plaque placed on the wall of the St. Nicholas Church in the village of Petrovka-2, Alexandrovsky District—the parish church for the village of Znamenovka, Natalia Modestovna Frederiks' birthplace.\nSt. Natalia of Solovki, pray to God for us!",
