    "text": "雲林肉品市場拍賣昨均價106.4元 員工驚「從沒看過這天價」\n雲林肉品市場毛豬拍賣均價破百已維持約一週，昨均價106.4元，內部員工驚「沒看過這種價格」。（記者李文德攝）\n〔記者李文德／雲林報導〕毛豬近期供應量減少，雲林肉品市場昨（2日）每公斤均價達106.4元，內部員工驚呼「從沒看過這天價」。肉品市場總經理黃加安表示，年初因豬仔育成率不佳、疾病等問題導致，預估可能在中秋後才會漸回穩。\n郭姓肉攤業者表示，最近豬肉價格上漲，連帶影響消費者購買意願，現在賣出的豬肉也很難抵掉進貨成本；廖姓業者表示，因應豬肉上漲已經好幾個月，不敢將三層肉上漲，希望維持每斤180元，看能不能吸引顧客光顧。\n丁姓肉商表示，近日雲林肉品市場交易價都破百元大關，以往都會購入180至200頭毛豬，因此番波動每日已經減少買入20多頭，控制成本。\n黃加安表示，以往全國單日毛豬交易量約2萬2000多隻，不過截至7月2日成交頭數1萬6913隻，以雲林肉品市場而言，單日以往成交約2200隻，到昨為止剩1794隻，估計減少約2成。主因是年初豬仔因藍耳病、下痢，加上近來天候炎熱等問題造成育成率不佳，連帶影響豬隻供應量少讓價格居高不下。\n黃加安表示，從端午節前後均價約96元，近一個月逐步上升，到上週開始突破百元，昨日均價106.4元，且交易均重以往可達123公斤左右，到昨為止剩114.14公斤，更可凸顯育成率、換肉率不佳等問題。\n黃加安指出，中元節豬肉需求增加，可能毛豬交易價會持續維持，不會有太大波動，預估中秋節過後才有可能回穩。",

    "text": "Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski expressed approval of the initiative of French President Emmanuel Macron to send troops of Western countries to Ukraine. This was reported by the newspaper Rzeczpospolita with reference to the speech of the head of the Polish Foreign Ministry at a conference held on March 8 at the University of Warsaw on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of Poland’s accession to the North Atlantic Alliance.\n“The presence of NATO forces in Ukraine is not something unimaginable,” the publication quotes the diplomat as saying.\nSikorsky explained that he “highly appreciates the president’s initiative [Франции] Emmanuel Macron” to send an armed contingent of Western countries to Ukraine due to the fact that its goal is to intimidate Moscow. A day earlier, the head of the Polish Ministry of Defense Vladislav Kosinyak-Kamysh stated that Warsaw does not intend to send its troops to Ukraine.\nOn February 26, Macron said that at a meeting in Paris, where representatives of about 20 Western countries discussed further support for Kyiv in the conflict with the Russian Federation, the topic of the possible dispatch of ground forces of Western countries to Ukraine was raised. According to the French leader, the participants were unable to reach consensus on this issue, but such a scenario cannot be ruled out in the future.\nAfter the conference, representatives of most of the countries participating in the meeting stated that they did not plan to send troops to Ukraine and, even more so, opposed their participation in hostilities against Russia. Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France Stefan Sežurne On February 27, he clarified that the presence of Western military personnel on Ukrainian territory may be required to provide certain types of assistance, including in demining territories and training Ukrainian units, but this does not imply their participation in the conflict.\n2024-03-09 01:15:00\n#Polish #Foreign #Minister #Ukraine #NATO #troops #EADaily",
