Elected Liberals outside of Justin Trudeau's cabinet have largely remained silent about the prime minister's political future in the party, and those who want to see him step down won't say so publicly. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick Those who want Trudeau to step down won’t say so publicly.\nDuguid admits many MPs are frustrated but adds those feelings stem from the struggle to connect with Canadians, not concerns about the prime minister.\nWinnipeg Free Press | Newsletter Business Weekly Monday mornings\nThe latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week.\nSign up for Business Weekly Sign Up I agree to the Terms and Conditions, Cookie and Privacy Policies , and CASL agreement .

    "text": "Table of Contents\nWaqar Salamkheil produced a moment of magic in the International League (IL)T20 2025 match between MI Emirates and Desert Vipers, dismissing the dangerous Alex Hales with the beauty of a delivery.\nWaqar Salamkheil dismantles Alex Hales with a stunning delivery\nBowling the very first ball of his spell, Salamkheil unleashed a mesmerizing leg-break that was nothing short of a masterclass in spin bowling. The delivery landed on a good length just outside off stump, gripping the surface with precision and fizzing through the air. Hales, who had been batting fluently, completely misjudged the trajectory and spin. Expecting less turn, he left an expansive gap between his bat and pad, creating an inviting pathway for the ball. With sharp deviation off the pitch, the ball zipped through the gap, clipped the top of the middle stump, and sent it cartwheeling. The sheer artistry of the delivery left Hales visibly stunned and underlined Waqar’s ability to deceive even the most accomplished batters with his guile and control.\nThis dismissal broke the Vipers’ strong opening stand of 62 runs and provided Emirates with a crucial breakthrough. Hales’ quickfire knock of 34 off 22 balls, including six boundaries, was pivotal for the Vipers’ aggressive start, but Waqar’s brilliance brought it to an end. It was a perfect example of a bowler outwitting a set batter with skill and precision.\nHere’s the video:\nAbsolute 𝙥𝙚𝙖𝙘𝙝 🤩\n[#ILT20onZee][#T20HeroesKaJalwa][#DPWorldILT20][#DVvMIE][pic.twitter.com/FtV1tpWcb3]— Zee Cricket (@ilt20onzee)\n[January 16, 2025]\nAlso WATCH: Adam Milne’s destructive bowling shatters the stumps of Phil Salt and Kyle Mayers in ILT20 2025\nDesert Vipers outshine MI Emirates: Fakhar Zaman’s remarkable knock\nIn a closely contested match at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, The Vipers secured a commanding 5-wicket victory over the Emirates with five balls to spare. Chasing a target of 160, Fakhar Zaman anchored the innings with a brilliant 67 off 52 balls, striking 5 fours and 4 sixes. Hales gave a brisk start with a 22-ball 34, adding 62 runs for the first wicket with Fakhar. Though Emirates fought back with timely wickets, Sam Curran‘s 28 and Sherfane Rutherford‘s explosive 21 off just 8 balls sealed the win. Earlier, the Emirates posted 159/6, with Kieron Pollard top-scoring with a 23-ball 36. Lockie Ferguson was the pick of the bowlers for Vipers, claiming 2 wickets for 25 runs. The victory kept Vipers unbeaten in the tournament and cemented their position at the top of the points table.",

    "text": "If you didn&apos;t get a chance to see the Northern Lights, you might have another chance Friday night thanks to a \"severe\" geomagnetic storm. According to Armen Kurdian, a certified aero systems engineering professional, there could be a second-chance to view the jaw-dropping sky. The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration forecasts the storm will reach a G-4 rating – or become a \"severe\" geomagnetic storm. The highest rating on the geomagnetic scale is G-5.The Northern Lights are forecast to reach as far south as Northern California through Alabama. If the aurora display is relatively dim, it may only appear to your eyes as a faint green or milky haze, depending on the strength of the show. If the storm really gets going, more dazzling greens and purples may be seen with just your eyes, provided they&apos;ve adjusted to the darkness.It is recommended to use a camera, set it on long exposure, and the lights will pop out. Some even say cameras are better than the human eye at picking up the color at night.The NOAA recommends the following tips for the best chance to see the Northern Lights.",
