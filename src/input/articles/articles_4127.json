    "title": "After talks over 12 years, ULFA inks peace pact with govt; Amit Shah terms it historic - Shafaqna India | Indian Shia News Agency",
    "text": "The pro-talks faction of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) on Friday signed a peace accord with the Centre and Assam Government in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, signalling its return to the mainstream by shunning violence. Shah said all conditions of the pact would be fulfilled in a time-bound manner and for it, a committee would be formed by the Centre with the help of Assam Government. The Centre had been holding negotiations with Arabinda Rajkhowa-led faction for over 12 years. Formed in 1979 to press for a “sovereign Assam”, the ULFA was banned in 1990 for participating in violent activities. The hardline faction, headed by Paresh Baruah, is still not part of the peace accord. Baruah reportedly lives along the China-Myanmar border. The Rajkhowa faction had joined the peace talks with the government on September 3, 2011, after an agreement for suspension of operations was signed between it and central and state governments. “Assam had been witnessing violence for years but since the Modi government came to power in 2014, efforts were made to talk to all stakeholders. As a result, a terror-free Northeast is now a reality. In the last five years, nine peace and border accords were signed,” said Shah. He said over 9,000 militants had surrendered across Assam and AFSPA provisions had been removed from 85 per cent of the state. Calling the pact “historic”, Shah said a “very big” financial package as well as development projects had been approved.",

    "title": "Corpus Domini: mons. Parisi (Lamezia Terme), “il senso della vita di Gesù è quello di essere donata agli altri, essere per gli altri” - AgenSIR",
    "text": "“Il senso della vita di Gesù è proprio quello di essere donata agli altri, essere per gli altri”. Lo ha detto il vescovo di Lamezia Terme, mons. Serafino Parisi, nell’omelia della messa del Corpus Domini, celebrata ieri sera in cattedrale. Il presule si è soffermato sulla forza dell’amore “che ha guidato la vita di Gesù. Cioè, quell’amore – ha detto – che è capace di amare chi, non solo è irriconoscente, ma anche chi è ingrato”. “L’esistenza ha un senso – ha aggiunto – se è un’esistenza donata, quella che con una parola viene detta l’agape, cioè l’amore oblativo, l’amore che si dona, che si consegna, che non aspetta il contraccambio, ricompense e nemmeno i ringraziamenti, l’amore che sa essere amore anche per quelli come Giuda che l’hanno tradito, come gli apostoli che l’hanno abbandonato, come Pietro che lo ha rinnegato”. “Il messaggio del brano del Vangelo di oggi – ha spiegato mons. Parisi – è quello dell’ultima cena, del pane spezzato, che è il corpo di Gesù, e del sangue versato, che è il sangue di Gesù, che viene presentato all’interno del testo come dono d’amore. Cioè, la scelta del figlio di Dio è quella di donare la sua vita per amore” ed “il dono d’amore dell’Eucarestia, il corpo consegnato di Gesù, insegna a noi credenti, a noi cristiani che il modello dell’amore, della consegna, della donazione, di questa oblatività, cioè diventare dono per l’altro, la mia vita diventa vita per te anche se devo sacrificarla e tu non lo meriti, diventa ancora più forte se collocato all’interno di questo contesto di peccato, di fragilità umana, di limite. Dentro questo limite accade l’amore di Dio. Anzi è questo limite dell’umanità che dice a Dio che proprio questo baratro deve essere abitato, proprio questa frattura deve essere riempita dal suo amore. Questa è la forza dell’Eucarestia. Allora, quando noi celebriamo l’Eucarestia, entriamo dentro questo legame di una fraternità che certamente è costruita sul sangue”. Al termine della messa mons. Parisi ha presieduto la processione del Corpus Domini che si è conclusa sul sagrato della cattedrale.",

Visit image gallery to purchase the image.\nBy John Lewis News Dunedin Campus 0 Comments University of Otago Emeritus Professor Dame Linda Holloway. PHOTO: ODT FILES An \"extraordinary trailblazer\" for women in medicine is to be awarded an honorary doctor of laws at tomorrow’s University of Otago graduation ceremony.\nEmeritus Professor Dame Linda Holloway is to receive the honour for a career spanning 60 years, during which she has been a prominent pathologist, a pro-vice-chancellor of health sciences for the University of Otago, and the first woman to be dean of the Otago Medical School.\nWhile the 84-year-old was \"honoured, overwhelmed and very excited\" to receive the honour, she was looking forward to giving the graduation address even more.\nDame Linda said the first part of her speech would remind the graduands about how lucky they were to have had such a \"well-rounded\" education, because it meant there was so much potential for them to develop different career paths.\n\"But in the second part of the talk, I’ve been very naughty because I will talk about the new hospital.\n\"Health should be considered an investment, not a cost.\n\"So I’m asking the graduates to take that message with them wherever they go, because Cliff the ambulance can’t be everywhere all at once.\"\nDame Linda came to national prominence when she was the pathology medical adviser for the Cartwright Inquiry (1987-88), which investigated the treatment of women with cervical cancer at National Women’s Hospital in Auckland.\nIt was a watershed moment in patients’ rights around the globe which led to significant reforms towards a patient-centred healthcare system.\nDame Linda started her career at the University of Aberdeen, graduating with a bachelor of medicine and bachelor of surgery in 1964.\nAfter graduating, she trained in academic and diagnostic pathology, before moving to New Zealand in 1970.\nShe lived in Gisborne and later moved to West Otago, where she spent time in rural general practice, before relocating to Dunedin and completing her specialist training.\nAt this time, she returned to Scotland for two years where she was a senior lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, and at the same time she completed her doctoral thesis in perinatal pathology and gained experience in lung pathology.\nOn returning to New Zealand, she accepted an appointment as a senior lecturer in Otago’s department of pathology.\nShe later became professor and then dean of the Wellington School of Medicine — the first woman to be a dean of medicine in the country — before moving to the Dunedin campus.\nShe has also held several board roles, including the chairwoman of the National Health Committee, a member of the Medicines Assessment Advisory Committee, a long-serving chairwoman of the Abortion Supervisory Committee, and director of the Institute of Environmental Health and Forensic Sciences Ltd.\nDame Linda was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 1997 for services to medicine, and was elevated to Distinguished Companion in 2005, and Dame Companion in 2009.\n\"In the years following my retirement from full-time work, I have enjoyed providing interim leadership to a number of departments,\" she said.\n\"As someone who loves teaching, I have been able to continue to teach undergraduates in my discipline of pathology.\"\nShe will continue to teach pathology to medical students in Dunedin next year, but admitted she would be slowing down \"just a little\".\nVice-chancellor Grant Robertson said Dame Linda’s achievements were \"nothing short of extraordinary\".\n\"She has been a trailblazer for women in medicine and we are proud to have had her at Otago for so many years.\"\njohn.lewis@odt.co.nz",

    "text": "All homes that lost power as Storm Gerrit lashed Scotland have now been reconnected, bosses at power firm SSEN have confirmed. The electricity provider said its teams had worked through “particularly challenging conditions” to restore supplies to more than 48,000 homes. A final push by staff saw the last properties without electricity reconnected by 11pm on Friday, with customers in parts of Aberdeenshire, Perthshire and The Great Glen area in the Highlands all now with power again. Andy Smith, SSEN distribution’s operations director, said the storm had brought “serious disruption” with gale force winds having reached recorded speeds of 86mph in Inverbervie, Aberdeenshire and 84mph in Lerwick, Shetland. Mr Smith said: “Storm Gerrit caused serious disruption across the north of Scotland, and I would like to say thank you to our customers for their patience while we worked through some particularly challenging conditions to reconnect them, as quickly and safely as possible. “I’m very proud of the work undertaken by SSEN’s operational teams, and for being out at all hours and in all weathers to find and fix the faults over the past few days. “I would also like to extend my gratitude to our contract partners and fellow network operators for how they supported our response.” SSEN is now encouraging customers who were left without power to apply for compensation, depending on how long they were without electricity for. Completion of work to restore electricity supplies comes ahead of the latest weather alert, with a yellow warning for rain and snow having been issued for much of Scotland on Saturday. As a result of that Network Rail Scotland said speed restrictions will be in place on the West Highland Lines from 10am today until 9am on Sunday.

    "title": "La infidelidad de Fedez en Chiara Ferragni: el rapero tuvo una amante durante todo su matrimonio",
    "text": "Engañada durante todo su matrimonio: el momento más bajo de la 'influencer' Chiara Ferragni\nEl paparazzi que ha sacado a la luz la relación que ha mantenido el rapero durante los años de matrimonio con la 'influencer' asegura tener más información\nCualquier telenovela se queda corta comparada con la historia que está protagonizando Chiara Ferragni, la creadora de contenido más famosa de Italia y una de las influencers más conocidas en todo el mundo. Mientras intenta sobrevivir al barro legal por una presunta estafa en la venta benéfica de unos panettones, la imagen que hasta ahora se tenía de los años de matrimonio con el rapero Fedez se ha hecho añicos. Ferragni ha roto el silencio y ha publicado un comunicado para explicar cómo su ya exmarido la ha engañado durante años.\nLa italiana ha compartido con sus 28,6 millones de seguidores en Instagram un largo escrito (presentado en forma de stories) en el que explica cómo vivió el momento en que Fedez le explicó que durante todo su matrimonio había mantenido una relación paralela con la diseñadora de moda Angelica Montini. \"He optado por el silencio en los últimos meses para intentar protegerme a mí y a mi familia [...], pero ya no puedo quedarme callada\", comienza el escrito difundido anoche desde el perfil de Ferragni. \"Viví siete años de una relación en la que amé como quiero yo, sin límites. Amé incluso cuando había muchas razones para abandonar. Minimizando constantemente las faltas de respeto y justificando actitudes equivocadas para proteger a la otra parte, por proteger a la familia, para proteger a la pareja\", explica haciendo referencia al padre de sus dos hijos, del que se divorció hace un año.\n\"No dije nada públicamente ni siquiera cuando, unos días antes de Navidad [del 2024], Federico [Fedez] me llamó y confesó por primera vez la historia de amor con esta amante, que continuaba desde de 2017\", afirma la italiana, que confirma así la información publicada por Fabrizio Corona. Ahora bien, la confesión más explosiva aún estaba por llegar: \"También me dijo «Pensé en no casarme unos días antes de la boda, pero luego no supe cómo echarme atrás públicamente»\", dice la propia Ferragni. La boda entre la influencer y el rapero, que tuvo lugar el 1 de septiembre de 2018, reunió a cientos de personas y fue ampliamente retransmitido a través de la prensa y las redes. También contó con la implicación de diversas marcas comerciales.\nDe la vida de color rosa que durante años habían compartido en Instagram Ferragni y Fedez ya no queda nada. \"Entendí que lo que había vivido había sido una burla total, pero sufrí en silencio [...] porque tengo dos hijos que oirán todo lo que sus padres dijeron el uno del otro y lo pasarán mal por ciertas declaraciones\", añade Ferragni.\nDespués de ajustar cuentas con su exmarido, la influencer también señala directamente al paparazzi Fabrizzio Corona, que es quien ha revelado a los medios la infidelidad de Fedez, supuestamente con su consentimiento. \"Decidir, junto a tu amigo, que se harían públicos más detalles, probablemente para vengar el amor no correspondido de la amante, ha sido realmente bajo\", dice la empresaria, de 37 años. De esta forma Ferragni confirmaba lo que algunos medios italianos han apuntado en las últimas horas: la publicación de la relación extramatrimonial de Fedez estaba pactada después de que la mujer con la que había mantenido una relación paralela, Angelica Montini, haya querido romper definitivamente la relación con él. Montini, diseñadora de moda y que proviene de una de las familias más ricas de Milán, no ha mostrado ningún interés en mantener una relación pública con el rapero.\nLa respuesta del paparazzi en el comunicado de Ferragni\nSi Ferragni no se ha quedado corta con el comunicado, la respuesta del paparazzi y amigo de Fedez sólo ha añadido más leña al fuego. \"Estuviste en silencio todo este tiempo no porque quisieras salir adelante ni porque tus dos hijos no revivan todo esto. Desde hace un año lo único que le pides a Federico es poder mostrar a sus hijos en las redes. Tú, que nunca has estado con ellos porque solo haces que contratar a canguros\", dice. Además, Corona ha desmentido con tono amenazante que la publicación de esta información estuviera pactada: \"Te olvidas, querida Chiara, de quien soy y qué hago. Me llamo Fabrizio Corona y Federico se dejó llevar; dedico mi vida a hacer mi trabajo y no me detendrá nadie”.\nAdemás, el paparazzi ha soltado que Ferragni también había sido infiel a Fedez con el cantante italiano Achille Lauro. Su comunicado concluye prometiendo que habrá una nueva publicación de información sobre los entramados empresariales de la creadora de contenido y su vida privada.",
