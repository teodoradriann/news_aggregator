    "title": "Coal community advocates applaud new “10-Day Notice” rule for strengthening response to health, safety and pollution threats > Appalachian Voices",
    "text": "This morning, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement released its final “Ten Day Notice” rule to address how the agency responds to community member complaints about safety, pollution, and other violations at coal mines across the country. The final rule implements the intent of Congress that citizens have a pivotal role in monitoring the performance of coal mining operators and state regulatory authorities through the inspection and enforcement process. Congress struck a balance between providing some deference to state regulators in implementation of the federal mining laws requirements through a “ten-day” notice of suspected violations initiated by citizen requests, and the goal of remedying violations and ending the historic failures by the states in regulating mining impacts of people and the environment. “The Trump Administration’s 2020 rule upset that balance, and made it significantly harder for communities to secure timely compliance for violations occurring at mine sites, particularly where the violations were the result of state policies inconsistent with the federal law,” said Aimee Erickson, Executive Director of the Citizens Coal Council. “The rule restores common-sense policies that had been effectively followed by both OSMRE and state regulators in the decades preceding changes made to the rule in 2020.” Advocates specifically applaud OSMRE’s decisions in today’s rule to eliminate delays imposed by a “pre-review review” process imposed by the 2020 Trump Administration rule, and to require OSMRE to again address violations caused by a state regulator itself — such as permit defects — through the Ten Day Notice process. “Coal mines are often located in remote areas and only inspected occasionally by regulators, so local residents are essential to identifying safety and environmental hazards at these mines. This rule ensures that regulators will take community complaints seriously and make sure problems are addressed promptly,” said Erin Savage, Central Appalachian Senior Program Manager for Appalachian Voices. “We applaud the final rule from OSMRE, which will empower communities to alert regulators of violations at coal mine sites for prompt action as Congress intended under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. The coal industry has long attempted to exploit loopholes in the law to not clean up their toxic pollution. This rule offers the oversight needed to improve the well-being of people living near coal mining sites,” said Sierra Club Senior Attorney Peter Morgan. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 created a mechanism to empower community members to alert federal regulators of problems at coal mines, like a resident reporting dangerous coal mine waste running into a stream. The process allowed state regulators ten days to take action to correct the problem before federal regulators stepped in. Community members have successfully used the Ten Day Notice process to address violations ranging from erosion issues to drinking water contamination. Changes to the process in 2020 lessened OSMRE’s responsiveness to community concerns by providing excessive discretion and delay that effectively rendered many violations unaddressed. The changes imposed unnecessary bureaucratic burdens, exempted systemic permitting and other programmatic issues from the process, and allowed federal regulators to elect to forgo an inspection. In total, the Trump-era changes reduced the power of individuals and community organizations to access the means Congress had provided in SMCRA to actively address coal mining impacts to their communities. The updates are aligned with and address many of the issues raised in a 2021 court challenge to the Trump-era 2020 rules, filed by the Kentucky Resources Council on behalf of Appalachian Voices, Citizens Coal Council, and the Sierra Club, to restore community members’ ability to ensure enforcement of the law. The litigation has been stayed pending the time the new rule was being developed. Moreover, the new rule retains the improvements from the draft rule praised by 28 community groups in 2023. These include: - Cutting down on red tape by ending unnecessary data requests to state agencies and limiting reviews to publicly available information, information provided in the complaint and within the agency’s own files at the time the complaint was submitted; - Empowering community input by treating all community complaints as requests for federal inspection and allowing community members to accompany federal regulators on inspections; - Tackling systemic problems by including “permit defects” — or mining permits issued in violation of the law by state regulators — as a violation that can be addressed through the Ten Day Notice procedure. - Speeding up solutions by providing stricter timelines for response. One remaining issue that citizens groups will continue to work with OSMRE to resolve is assuring that on-the-ground violations resulting from programmatic state failures to properly implement the federal law through their approved state program are as timely corrected as if the violations were the result of a permittee’s failure to follow their permit or mine plan.",

The group said it targeted a gathering of enemy soldiers in the vicinity of the Avivim barracks and achieved a direct hit. It also confirmed that he had targeted buildings used by Israeli soldiers in the settlements of Zarit, al-Manara and Metulla, and had attacked Israeli soldiers’ positions in the settlement of Kiryat Shmona. The party added that it bombed the sites of al-Malikiyah, al-Marj, Jal al-Alam and the Baranit barracks, and a gathering of soldiers in the vicinity of the Metulla site, and in the vicinity of the Ghajar site in the occupied Golan. It pointed out that his attacks hit their targets accurately, and that they came in support of the steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and in support of their “valiant resistance.” Israeli Army Radio said a building in the town of Zarit in the Upper Galilee was hit directly and suffered material damage when a rocket fired from southern Lebanon landed in the area.

    "text": "At a time when Congress has not publicly declared its decision to participate in the Ram temple inauguration or not, CPM State Secretary MV Govindan on Friday said the dilly-dallying shows the national party's political bankruptcy. Addressing the media here, Govindan said as the main opposition party, Congress has the responsibility to uphold the values of secularism. \"They still do not understand that they cannot beat the hard-core Hindutva with their soft Hindutva. This has not dawned on them even after the defeat in the assembly elections in five states,\" he said. According to Govindan, the people of Madhya Pradesh rejected the soft Hindutva of Congress. \"In Gujarat when soft Hindutva was used to tackle the BJP's hard-core Hindutva agenda, we saw Congress losing even its core voters\", he added. \"The opposition can form a secular front for the coming general elections only by assimilating all anti-BJP votes across India. But when the parties that should take the lead in such endeavours use soft Hindutva to oppose BJP, they are propounding the hardcore right-wing policies,\" Govindan said. \"Congress should take a bold stand against BJP agenda by upholding the traditions of the country and its secular values. This is the common belief among all parties who want to see the BJP defeated in the election,\" he added. He said the BJP's decision to move away from India's history of supporting the Palestinian cause has its roots in the Congress' governments' decision to normalise diplomatic relationship with Israel. CPM, which is a part of the grand opposition alliance called INDIA, has already declined the invitation from the central government to participate in the inauguration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya.",

    "title": "When Leaders Fall “They’re Only Human” Doesn’t Help Our Disillusionment",
    "text": "It seems like it is impossible to go through a month without hearing of another Christian leader and their misdemeanors. The phenomenon is interpreted differently. Some feel like Pastors are being victimized as believers post their judgements all over social media. Others would prefer to ignore it and avoid all discussions. But unfortunately some Christians have been trying their best to battle through the disillusionment that can often happen when people you trust are discovered to have\na secret life.\nSo what exactly is disillusionment? To be brief, it is the shock, confusion, emotional and/or psychological instability that arises when you realize that the world or aspects therein, don’t work the way you once believed it to. These beliefs that we put our trust in, aren’t necessarily doctrine. They are formulas we have derived through life experience, that we assume to be biblical. For example: “If I do Christian things like serve at church, regularly attend church, read my Bible, pray…I will avoid hard things”. Often it’s not until a challenging situation, that we discover we had these beliefs in the first place. But disillusionment can settle in, in the process of relearning such beliefs.\nFor any person who is genuinely struggling with the disillusionment that has arisen in relation to such leaders, it is inevitable at some point that you will hear the statement, “Well the fact is they’re only human”. The statement is meant to imply that leaders are only humans too, open to the same temptations and frailties that all humans are. For a disillusioned person the statement couldn’t be more frustrating. They know that the person is only human, but usually that’s not the problem upending your previously perfect worldview. Here are four reasons why this statement can be incredibly difficult for a disillusioned person to swallow:\nWhy “They’re Only Human” Doesn’t Help\n1. It can be dismissive\nFor the genuinely disillusioned person, they often can’t make sense of the mess in their head. All they have is a sense that something is not right, and no obvious way to organize that confusion. None of the confusion they are experiencing is intended to come across angry, or judgmental. They’re just doing the best they can to find psychological and emotional clarity, which is often buried underneath a massive mess of thoughts. Sometimes the reason we make a statement like this is because we feel some need to defend the leader. Maybe the disillusioned person is being too harsh or we can just sense that they have a really imbalanced view on the situation. And we may be right! Maybe we feel compassion for the leader…and that’s okay too. But if the cost of asserting our opinions equates to a dismissal of a believer’s very genuine and active process of internal reorganization, it probably isn’t worth it. At least not in that specific moment.",

    "text": "United States District Judge Thomas O. Rice has mandated that three dairies in the Lower Yakima Valley conduct well testing and provide safe drinking water to residents at risk from nitrate-contaminated wells. This decision follows a motion for preliminary injunction by the United States, as announced by U.S. Attorney Vanessa R. Waldref.\nThe action is part of a lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice in June 2024 under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The lawsuit claims that these dairies have contributed to nitrate contamination in the area's groundwater, posing health risks such as methemoglobinemia, also known as \"blue baby syndrome.\"\nJudge Rice's order requires the dairies to test drinking water wells within a 3.5-mile radius downgradient of their locations and provide reverse-osmosis water treatment systems or bottled water where nitrate levels exceed 10 milligrams per liter. Additionally, the dairies must monitor groundwater and check a lined lagoon for leaks.\nThis legal action aims to address ongoing contamination issues and enforce compliance with a 2013 agreement between the dairies and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). U.S. Attorney Waldref emphasized, “Everyone deserves access to clean, safe drinking water.”\nDan Opalski from EPA’s Region 10 office expressed commitment to working with various stakeholders to tackle nitrate contamination challenges in the region.\nResidents are encouraged to visit EPA’s Lower Yakima Valley Groundwater webpage for information on affected areas and upcoming well testing offers. The court has given dairies 30 days to submit a testing plan and 60 days post-approval for completion.\nFor those outside the impacted area, free well testing is available through local initiatives.",
