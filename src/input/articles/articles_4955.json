    "title": "Omni Hotel Workers Go On Strike",
    "text": "By Jabez Choi ,\n9 hours ago Jabez Choi photo Strike! At the Omni on Temple St. Over 120 housekeepers, front desk agents, cooks, and other employees at the Omni Hotel went on strike early Thursday morning, amid an ongoing contract fight over better pay, healthcare, and pensions.\nThose downtown hotel workers walked out of their jobs at 5 a.m.\nThe Omni workers are represented by UNITE HERE Local 217; the strike was announced via a late Wednesday email press release sent out by Ian Dunn, a spokesperson for Yale’s UNITE HERE clerical and technical workers union, Local 34. That press release cites ​“painful workloads and wages that aren’t enough to afford the skyrocketing cost of living” as some of the reasons for the strike.\nAt around 7 a.m. Thursday, roughly three dozen striking workers rallied on the sidewalk in front of the 155 Temple St. hotel , which is formally called the Omni New Haven Hotel at Yale .\nThey wore red shirts bearing white and black text reading ​“Hotel Workers STRIKE” and ​“Local 217 UNITE HERE!” on the back. They carried signs stating: ​“ON STRIKE RESPECT OUR WORK” and ​“ON STRIKE MAKE THEM PAY.”\n“What do we want? Contracts!” the striking hotel workers chanted.\n“When do we want it? Now!”\n“No contract!” They continued. ​“No peace!”\nThe workers will be on strike for four days straight, and will be protesting in shifts, according to Omni front desk agent, Local 217 member, and hotel union ​“loyalty ambassador” Bobby May.\nBrenda McPherson, who has worked at the Omni for over 27 years as a banquet servers, joined her colleagues on the picket line Thursday. Her job entails serving meals as well as setting up and breaking down.\nShe said she’s seen a lot of downsizing over the years. She also noted she’s of retirement age, and so she’s fighting not only for herself, but also for future Omni workers and union members.\n“It’s like they don’t appreciate what we do,” she said about management. ​“I love my job, but I want them to appreciate what I do.”\nOnly guests are allowed in the hotel as of 7:30 a.m. Thursday.\n“It’s not fair to discuss the specifics of the contract because we are in the middle of negotiations,” Omni General Manager David Han told the Independent. The ​“union is exercising their right and we will continue to find a resolution.”\nThursday’s workplace walkout comes a little more than a month after the unionized Omni workers voted unanimously to authorize a strike amid unresolved contract negotiations , which in turn was followed by a hundreds-strong rally by local labor leaders and allies outside the hotel in mid-August.\nThe Omni workers’ last contract expired in late March. Represented workers include housekeepers, front desk agents, cooks, dishwashers, servers, bartenders, bellmen, and others.\nThe strike also comes as UNITE HERE-represented hotel workers across the country — in San Diego, Boston, Baltimore, and elsewhere — have gone on strike in recent weeks. And it comes as New Haven native Gwen Mills was elected president of the international union earlier this year .\nBy around 8 a.m., the crowd of strikers had grown to around 40. Passing cars beeped in support, as protesters blew their own loud red horns from the sidewalk.\nHotel banquet server Brenda McPherson (second from right): \"I love my job, but I want them to appreciate what I do.\" Omni front desk agent Bobby May: \"My father was a coal miner and his union health insurance saved his life.\" On Temple Street.

    "text": "“Pi Day” holds special meaning for Belleville family MADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - March 14 is “Pi Day.” People often celebrate by enjoying their favorite slice of their pie. But this year, “Pi Day” means so much more to one woman in Belleville and her family. Katie O’Dair spent much of her life surrounded by pie. Her parents, Beth and Charlie, had a passion for the sweet treat. WMTV 15 news featured Beth and Charlie in a story 5 years ago on March 14 -- Pi Day. The couple sold 200 pies in 45 minutes. “Everyone just loved them. Like there is no pie like a Beth pie, right,” said O’Dair. But in January 2023, Beth passed away after battling cancer. Shortly later, Charlie’s health took a turn for the worse and he passed away in September. “It’s been rough. it sometimes feels like you are glad they are at peace, but you wish they were still here,” O’Dair said. To help keep their memory alive, O’Dair turned to a former co-worker, Sara Stoltman, who also has a passion for baking. She is a retired nurse now running her own small business, [Thread Maven Stitching](https://threadmavenstitching.com/). O’Dair asked Stoltman if she could turn her mom’s contest ribbons into a quilt. Stoltman said she liked the idea but didn’t know if she could pull it off. “I was scared to death to sew with these,” Stoltman said. But Stoltman was up for the challenge and got to work on her sewing machine. Stitching fabric together, piece by piece, to create a memorial for a beloved couple and their passion for pie. “This is what I love to do,” Stoltman said. After some trial and error, Stoltman crafted a tapestry in honor of Beth and Charlie. “She came up with this and it could not have been more perfect,” O’ Dair said. The plan is to put this slice of creativity on display this summer at the Stoughton Fair with the hopes to win just one more ribbon. The quilt serves as a reminder that life may be short…but it sure is sweet.

    "title": "Five Unexpected Ways Your Home Renovation Can Backfire",
    "text": "A renovation can uncover exciting new problems you never knew you had. Credit: Ally Foster/Shutterstock\nHome renovation projects always start out in a rush of excitement—you're finally going to solve all those annoying problems, update those dated aspects of the house, and live the life you deserve! And sometimes it actually works out that way—but there are a lot of ways a renovation can go wrong. That's why nearly three-quarters of homeowners come to regret their renovations to some extent.\nMost of the reasons behind renovation regrets are pretty straightforward: Cost overruns, dissatisfaction with the final result, or shoddy work (either by contractors or DIY efforts) are the problems most people worry about when embarking on a renovation. But there are other, less obvious ways your renovation plans can backfire on you—problems that will only seem obvious in retrospect.\nI once innocently called my local utility company to come out and service my water heater, and ended the day with a dreaded \"red tag\" on my mechanical room—a paper notice that I had to bring something up to code. The worst part? The problem had nothing to do with my water heater, furnace, or anything else—it was the door to my mechanical room. When we renovated our house we had a new door hung, and it didn't have any ventilation built in. We passed city inspections after the reno, but now the utility company insisted I cut a louver into the door.\nIn another instance, a utility worker came by and noticed that our electrical panel was just in the wall. They informed me that there was a new requirement that panels be enclosed, so we had to build a fairly ridiculous box around the panel.\nThose are mild cases—it can be a lot worse. A nearby neighbor is renovating his house, and the utility company discovered that he shares a gas supply with his next-door neighbor, and that now has to be separated and re-routed despite the fact that neither of them have ever had a problem. The project is adding weeks to the renovation schedule and aggravating everyone involved. Often…\nJeff Somers",

    "title": "'Extinction looms?' Giraffes to be declared endangered for the first time",
    "text": "Produced by: Mohsin Shaikh Giraffes are set to join the endangered species list as their population plummets. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposes protections under the Endangered Species Act to curb their decline. For the first time, giraffes may receive formal protection, with restrictions on importing products like rugs, jewelry, and shoes made from their remains. These measures aim to fight poaching and wildlife trafficking. Giraffe numbers have dropped from 150,000 in 1985 to just 98,000 by 2015. Habitat loss, urbanization, poaching, and climate-induced drought are driving this alarming decline. “The U.S. decision supports giraffe conservation and ensures we do not contribute further to their decline,” said Martha Williams, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director. The U.S., a major market for giraffe products, could significantly reduce global demand with stricter trade limitations, aiding the species’ survival worldwide. Years of activism led to this proposal. Environmental groups like the NRDC and Center for Biological Diversity pushed for action, even filing a lawsuit in 2021 to force the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to act. The seven-year delay in protecting giraffes underscores a larger crisis, with millions of species at risk. Advocates stress the need for urgent measures to save biodiversity. The proposal includes new funding for giraffe conservation efforts in African nations, emphasizing global collaboration to protect these iconic animals. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is inviting public feedback on the proposal until February 19, with plans to finalize protections by the year’s end. Your voice could help save the giraffes.",

    "text": "Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 26 (AFI) – Gabriel Pires foi anunciado como novo reforço do Panserraikos , da Grécia . Após rescindir seu contrato com o Fluminense , o volante iniciou conversas e acertou seu retorno ao futebol europeu. A passagem nas Laranjeiras não correspondeu às expectativas dos torcedores.\nMAIS DETALHES Desde o início de 2024 na equipe, o jogador teve diversas lesões que o impediram de ter uma sequência. Com a demissão de Fernando Diniz e a contratação de Mano Menezes, perdeu ainda mais espaço no clube. Ao todo, entrou em campo apenas oito vezes no conturbado período em que defendeu o Tricolor. Desde a reta final da temporada, a diretoria já estudava o encerramento do vínculo, que era válido até o final do ano que vem.\nOs problemas físicos acompanham Gabriel desde o ano passado, quando vestiu as cores do Botafogo . Contratado pelo Alvinegro em 2022, disputou duas temporadas em General Severiano e teve um tempo de jogo maior. No entanto, assim como no Fluminense, as lesões não permitiram que ele tivesse mais minutos em campo.\nGabriel Pires começou sua trajetória no Resende e foi para Europa ainda jovem defender a Juventus. Antes de retornar ao futebol brasileiro, ele passou por Pro Vercelli, Spezia, Livorno, Leganés, Benfica e Al-Gharafa.\nMISSÃO CUMPRIDA Em 2024, o Fluminense lutou contra o rebaixamento até a última rodada do Campeonato Brasileiro. Com a confirmação da permanência na elite do futebol nacional, o clube garantiu uma vaga na próxima edição da Copa Sul-Americana .\nNa próxima temporada, o time de Arias, Ganso, Thiago Silva e comapanhia disputará o Super Mundial de Clubes , que terá início em junho. Os cariocas estão no grupo A do torneio, ao lado de Borussia Dortmund , da Alemanha, Ulsan Hyundai , da Coreia do Sul, e Mamelodi Sundowns , da África do Sul.",
