    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — A man was arrested Thursday for his alleged role in a deadly shooting on Indianapolis' northeast side in late December.\nOn Dec. 28, IMPD officers responded to an apartment complex in the\n3400 block of Alsuda Court, just northeast of Binford Boulevard and East 46th Street, shortly before 3 a.m. for a report of a person shot.\nPolice found a man outside an apartment building who was pronounced dead at the scene.\nThe Marion County Coroner's Office identified the victim as 31-year-old Joshua Hopson.\nAn IMPD spokesperson said shortly after that, preliminary information led police to believe the victim was involved in a disturbance before he was shot. The suspect was not at the scene when officers arrived.\nOn Thursday, Jan. 5, IMPD officers with the Violent Crimes Unit located and arrested Emmanuel Newman for his alleged role in the shooting.\nThe Marion County Prosecutor's Office will review the case and make final charging decisions.\nAnyone with information on the incident is asked to contact Detective Kyle Hoover at the IMPD Homicide Office at 317-327-3475 or Kyle.Hoover@indy.gov. Tips can also be submitted anonymously to Crime Stoppers of Central Indiana at 317-262-8477.",

    "text": "Mumbai, Dec 28 : Chennaiyin FC suffered a 0-3 loss against Mumbai City FC in the Indian Super League (ISL) 2023-24 match at the Mumbai Football Arena on Thursday. Lallianzuala Chhangte scored the opening goal of the match for the home team in the 52nd minute. Vikram Partap Singh (80th) and Gurkirat Singh (90th) netted second and third goal respectively for the winning side. Coming into the match after defeats in their respective last matches, both the teams started aggressively. Chennaiyin looked solid in defence as well as they denied the hosts a few close scoring chances early in the match. Chennaiyin came close to scoring their first goal in the 11th minute but Sarthak Goluiâ€™s shot missed the target. Mumbai City were given a spot kick in the 36th minute when Vikram drew a foul in the penalty area. However, Chhangte failed to convert it as his left-footed shot hit the bar. The visitors once again demonstrated their defensive prowess when Ryan Edwards impressively blocked Jorge Pereyra Diazâ€™s strike in front of the goal just before the break. The Islanders managed to take the lead seven minutes into the second half when Chhangte found the target. Later, Vikram converted a penalty kick to make it 2-0 for Mumbai City. Owen Coyleâ€™s men gave their all in order to make a comeback. However, Gurkirat scored Mumbai Cityâ€™s third goal to take the game further away. Chennaiyin have concluded the first half of the season with 12 poi nts.",

    "text": "Ecoener recibió el máximo “Reconocimiento a la inversión extranjera directa en la República Dominicana”, concedido en la edición 2024 durante un evento que tuvo lugar en la sede del Banco Central del país. La distinción, otorgada por ProDominicana (Centro de Exportación e Inversión del gobierno de la República Dominicana), premia la trayectoria y la aportación de la compañía presidida por Luis de Valdivia, en su apuesta por ampliar sus operaciones y contribuir positivamente al desarrollo económico y social del país. Durante el evento, se puso también en valor la contribución de Ecoener a la soberanía energética del país y en la lucha contra el cambio climático. El presidente de la República Dominicana, Luis Abinader Corona entregó el galardón al vicepresidente ejecutivo de Ecoener, Fernando Rodríguez Alfonso. República Dominicana ha experimentado un notable crecimiento, convirtiéndose en una economía de referencia en Latinoamérica. Su PIB ha aumentado entorno al 5% de media anual en los últimos años como destaca un reciente estudio del Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI). Rodríguez Alfonso agradeció este reconocimiento y manifestó que “la economía de República Dominicana está creciendo de manera sostenida y estable. Desde Ecoener queremos contribuir a este progreso invirtiendo y haciendo crecer nuestra compañía de manera sólida, como lo está haciendo el país”. En el acto estuvieron también presentes el ministro de Industria, Comercio y Mypimes, Víctor Bizonó; el ministro de la Presidencia, Joel Santos; la directora ejecutiva de ProDominicana, Biviana Riveiro, o el embajador de España en la República Dominicana, Antonio Pérez-Hernández y Torra, entre otras autoridades. En este momento, el plan de inversión de Ecoener en la República Dominica alcanza los 289 millones de dólares para la puesta en marcha de 5 parques fotovoltaicos que aportarán a la empresa 279 MW de potencia instalada. Dos de ellos, Cumayasa 1 y 2 (97 MW), se encuentran en operación desde el pasado mes de noviembre. Estas instalaciones producen el volumen de energía equivalente al consumo anual de 48.000 hogares, evitan la emisión anual de 140.000 toneladas de CO2 a la atmósfera y el consumo de 17.000 toneladas de combustibles fósiles. Ecoener generó 300 puestos de trabajo en su construcción y la instalación de los paneles fue realizada mayoritariamente por mujeres, formadas y empleadas específicamente para ello. Cumayasa 1 y 2, que contó con una inversión de 100 millones de dólares, incorporan además una novedosa experiencia de agrivoltaica, en la que se combina la producción de energía solar con el pastoreo. Es un modo de implicar y favorecer la simbiosis de la compañía con la sociedad local, conjugando seguridad alimentaria y energética de manera equilibrada y respetuosa con el medio ambiente. Además de las instalaciones ya operativas, Ecoener está construyendo otras tres plantas fotovoltaicas en República Dominicana. Por un lado, Cumayasa 4 (62 MW), ubicada en la provincia de La Romana y donde la compañía está invirtiendo más de 63 millones de dólares. Por otro lado, las plantas Payita 1 y 2 (60 MW cada una), localizadas en el norte del país, y en las que Ecoener realiza una inversión conjunta de 126 millones de dólares. Estos tres activos de Ecoener poseerán una capacidad de producción anual conjunta equivalente al consumo de 93.000 hogares, evitarán el consumo de 34.000 toneladas de combustibles fósiles y la emisión de cerca de 200.000 toneladas de CO2 a la atmósfera.",
