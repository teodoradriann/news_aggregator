    "text": "According to data published by the Norwegian Institute for Research of the World (Prio), the number of armed clashes with the participation of states has reached the maximum over the past 80 years.\nIn 2024, it was recorded around the world 61 armed confrontation in 36 countries is the highest indicator from the end of World War IIreports Bb.lv.\nAnalysts of the institute note Sustainable growth in conflicts: in 2022 there were 56 of them, in 2023 – already 59. Last year, 11 were classified among these clashes as full -scale wars.\nIn the report “Global Review of Conflicts: Trends”, it is emphasized that two of these wars dominated the number of victims: Russian aggression against Ukraine, which, according to estimates, led to the death of about 76 thousand people, and the escalation of the conflict in the gas sector, which has taken off 26 thousand lives.\nThe total mortality rate from armed violence in 2023 and 2024 was approximately the same – about 129,000 dead. This indicator significantly exceeds the average values of the last 30 years. Thus, 2024 became the fourth most deadly year since the end of the Cold War in 1989.\nAfrica – epicenter of violence. Particular attention in the report is paid to internal conflicts in which the national government takes part. The largest number of such cases recorded In Africa – 28 conflictswhich is twice the number of ten years ago. She is following her Asia (17 conflicts), the Middle East (10), Europe (3) and America (2).\nDespite the growth of interstate conflicts, the study notes a small reduction in the number of non -state clashes – from 80 in 2023 to 74 in 2024.\nSiri Aas Rustad, director of Prio and one of the authors of the report, emphasized:\n“The modern world has become much more cruel and fragmented compared to the situation of ten years ago. The closure of borders and the refusal to participate in international processes in the context of global growth of violence can result in catastrophic consequences for millions of people. ”\nSome conflicts last for several days, others – years, decades and even centuries.

    "text": "20 fillings, 4 root canals, 8 crowns in one visit add up to lawsuit for Minnesota dentist [Mary Walrath-Holdridge](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/12093029002/mary-walrathholdridge/) A Minnesota dentist has become the subject of a malpractice lawsuit after his patient accused him of \"disfiguring\" her. The civil lawsuit was filed in Hennepin County, Minnesota last week by Kathleen Wilson, who alleged Dr. Kevin Molldrem and [Molldrem Family Dentistry](https://molldremdentistry.com/) caused her significant injury that is still being corrected. According to the suit, Molldrem performed more than 30 producers on Wilson in a single July 2020 visit, doing eight crowns, four root canals and 20 fillings in one go. The lawsuit alleges that the dentist \"perform[ed] this work improperly,\" resulting in pain and suffering, embarrassment, emotional distress, and disfigurement. Molldrem was likewise accused of using improper levels of anesthesia during the procedures and falsifying medical records to cover it up. Treatment called 'inconceivable' “It is inconceivable that Dr. Molldrem could have prepared and placed 8 crowns under these circumstances in the time allotted, not to mention the additional 20 restorations,” wrote [Dr. Avrum Goldstein,](https://www.seakexperts.com/members/4827-avrum-r-goldstein) a dentist and expert witness brought on by Wilson's attorney, in an affidavit. Goldstein, who is a faculty member at [NOVA Southeastern University](https://dental.nova.edu/aboutus/faculty/goldstein-avrum%20.html?_gl=1*1kqtqxq*_gcl_au*ODA4NzUxNTA1LjE3MDM3OTc5MjI.), also wrote that Wilson had been correctly diagnosed as having a \"rare condition\" causing decay in almost all of her teeth, but Mollderm's course of action was not a proper form of treatment. \"[Wilson’s] required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease,” he said in his report. “Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanly possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner.” Doctors remove wrong organ from man: [They opened him up to remove his appendix. They mistakenly took out much more, lawsuit says.](/story/news/health/2023/11/07/doctors-accidentally-remove-wrong-organ-surgery/71487292007/) The lawsuit also accused Mollderm of tampering with medical records to falsify the amount of anesthesia that was reportedly used, which in reality was nearly double the standard number of units, according to court paperwork. According to Goldstein, the maximum dose of anesthesia given in three hours should not exceed 490 mg, but Molldrem's records show he gave Wilson 960 mg. “Any negative cardiovascular or central nervous system outcomes could be tied to the local anesthetic overdose,\" he wrote. Wilson said in the suit that she has since had to have the dental work completely redone by other dentists to repair Molldrem’s “negligent work,\" an ongoing process that has caused her to lose income and rack up medical bills on top of enduring pain, suffering and embarrassment. She is seeking more than $50,000 in damages. Wilson's attorney and Molldrem did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "title": "Experts scrambling to control Ontario's avian flu outbreak as feds stockpile vaccines",
    "text": "With numerous cases of avian influenza appearing in Ontario, experts are scrambling to prevent a potential mass outbreak.\nLast December, seven poultry farms in southern Ontario were quarantined due to the pathogenic avian influenza strain(s) HPAI/H5N1, colloquially known as bird flu.\nAs a byproduct of these contaminations, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) cut off the impacted areas, euthanized all potentially infected poultry, and ensured that all nearby farms were not exposed.\n“I would say we can call this an exceptional outbreak,” the CFIA’s deputy incident commander of avian influenza response, Brian Hamilton, told INsauga.com.\nWith uncharacteristic outbreaks occurring in Ontario, how safe is the province from an avian flu epidemic among humans?\nYesterday (Feb. 19), the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) released an announcement concerning the procurement of avian flu vaccines to curb what the federal government deemed as an “unprecedented” spread of the virus.\nAt the time of publication, 500,000 vaccine doses have been secured by the feds, however, only 60 per cent of the available inventory is being sent out to provinces and territories, while the other 40 per cent, will remain under lock and key in the event of a potential pandemic.\nA corresponding document from December 2024 by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) ruled that as long as the country remains in a pre-pandemic state, the distribution of these vaccines will likely prioritize those working near potential contamination scenarios.\nThese include lab workers, poultry farmers, veterinarians, and wildlife researchers.\nHowever, even with these preventative measures, experts in the field are still preparing for the worst.\n“I think to be truthful, we are underestimating the power of this virus and the predictability of it. It has proven us wrong too many times and we can’t trust it. It doesn’t respect our politics and it doesn’t respect our borders — it certainly doesn’t respect what we think we know about how to mitigate it,” Dr. Shayan Sharif, interim VP of research and innovation at Guelph University, told INsauga.com.\nSharif — who has an extensive background as a professor of immunology — has been following this current strain of avian flu since its emergence in 2020/2021.\nSharif notes that while this current pathogen in Ontario is likely to be traced back to birds from the Maritimes, as the years have progressed, complex factors have entrenched it within the province and, by extension, Canada.\nAs climate change progresses, Sharif notes that migratory birds are acting erratically, and as a result, lingering where they shouldn’t be and spreading the virus amongst both wild and agricultural avian species.\n“So if you’re in cities in Ontario right now, you are likely seeing a lot of Canadian geese or other birds, sometimes, in parks or local bodies of water. Now, is this normal for this time of year? No,” says Sharif.\nBeyond extended avian layovers in Ontario, the encroaching spring season has Sharif more concerned, as the remainder of migratory birds flooding the province will increase the likelihood of new strains and mutations.\n“It’s just getting worse and worse. This virus, like any virus, has new mutants and new strains. Most of them are H5N1 but now some are emerging as other types of avian influenza, all with new variants and genotypes,” says Sharif. “Hopefully, it will get better but it still remains a huge cause for concern, as it could potentially adapt itself to human cells.”\nWhile human transmission of avian influenza remains incredibly rare , last November, a teenage girl in B.C. was infected with the H5N1 strain and hospitalized for several months.\n“No one knows how this patient contracted the virus,” says Sharif.\nWhile the cause of transmission remains a mystery, official correspondence from the B.C. government indicated that it was likely due to an interaction with infected wild birds, not livestock.\nCurrently, the U.S. is also struggling with an outbreak of avian influenza, drastically impacting their agricultural economy.\nBoth the American Bread Belt — U.S. agricultural states — and Ontario are connected to what is known as the Mississippi Flyway, one of the world’s largest migratory avian causeways connecting the Arctic to South America.\nAs a result of this shared exposure, Jianhong Wu, professor and director for Advanced Disaster, Emergency, and Rapid Response Simulations at York University, has been closely monitoring how the virus has been spreading throughout the North American continent.\n“Southern Ontario is vulnerable, and the issue of avian flu is going very poorly south of the border. So, I think issues in the U.S. potentially impacting us are inevitable. So the only thing we really can do is increase our surveillance systems and rapid response capabilities,” Wu told INsauga.com\nDespite the province’s vulnerability, Wu did indicate that Ontario (and Canada) are in a much better position to address a potential outbreak, specifically due to lessons learned during COVID-19 — a potential throughline to yesterday’s bulk procurement of vaccines.\nHowever, what separates a potential human pathogen of avian flu from COVID-19 is that its functionality remains in the dark. Add this to the fact that the only recent reference point is one patient from last November, and alarm bells start ringing throughout the scientific community.\n“The girl who contracted avian influenza last November was in the hospital for two months,” says Sharif. “She was provided with the best possible intensive care that anyone in Canada could get — in an order of magnitude more than anyone in Canada could get. Still, she was in the hospital for two months. It was just one patient in the ICU for two months. Could you imagine if we had hundreds or thousands of people taking up hospital beds for two months? What are we going to do?”\nWhile authorities remain on high alert, those who excel in emergency response procedures like Wu believe that while a potential mass outbreak of avian flu (human or otherwise) can happen anywhere, it’s up to response forces to ensure public safety.\nAnd if they can’t ensure it, at least prepare for what happens next.\n“If this is going to happen, it’s going to happen somewhere. What we have to do then, is to slow it down and buy the province and the country some time,” he says.",
