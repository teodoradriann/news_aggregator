    "title": "'Productivity crisis': Canadian employers cite challenges of inflation, burnout",
    "text": "Report highlights importance of benefits to boost productivity, alleviate financial stress\nCanadian employers are grappling with declining employee productivity despite expressing optimism about their businesses' prospects, according to a new survey.\nInflation and interest rates are cited as key challenges, with 78% of employers reporting negative impacts from inflation—up seven percentage points from 2023.\nEmployee burnout (68%), increased hiring competition (63%, down eight points), and ongoing labour shortages (62%, down nine points) are further straining employers, found the survey by the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP) and Angus Reid Group.\nInterest rates are also a concern, with 60% of employers noting their negative impact when the policy rate stood at 4.5%. Even if the rate drops to 3.5%, more than a third (37%) believe their businesses will continue to face challenges.\nWhile 82% of employers feel optimistic about their business productivity and 77% about employee productivity for the year ahead, these sentiments are at odds with recent trends. Only 24% of employers reported better-than-normal productivity in the past year, a significant drop of 17 points since 2022.\nAdditionally, the proportion of employers rating employee productivity as excellent or very good fell to 47%, down 10 points since 2023, found the survey.\nA notable 20% of employers reported worse-than-usual productivity in the past year, up seven points from 2023, found the survey.\nNearly three-quarters (72%) agree Canada is experiencing a productivity crisis, and 90% recognize that business productivity hinges on employee performance.\nThe survey highlights a strong correlation between investing in employee benefits and improved productivity. Employers who introduced or enhanced retirement benefits were more likely to report better-than-normal productivity (42%) than those who did not invest in their employees (12%).\nSimilarly, 28% of employers who improved compensation saw productivity gains, found the survey.\nEmployers who reported declining productivity also expressed greater concern for their employees’ well-being:\nThese employers were also more likely to cite employee burnout as a significant challenge (85%) compared to those with better productivity outcomes (64%).\nA vast majority of employers (86%) believe offering benefits that alleviate financial stress is crucial, with 83% agreeing retirement benefits are a cost-effective way to address financial stress. Two-thirds (66%) believe such benefits help maintain employee productivity.\nDespite these acknowledgments, fewer employers invested in benefits last year (78%, down 15 points since 2023) or plan to do so in the coming year (62%, down 20 points). This reluctance to invest may exacerbate the downward trend in employee productivity despite employers’ optimism for future performance.\nThe survey was conducted online from August 12 to 22, 2024, and involved 759 Canadian business owners and senior leaders with at least 20 employees who influence HR decisions.",

O clube alviverde está disposto a liberar o atleta pelos 15 milhões de euros (R$ 80,5 mi, na cotação) oferecidos pelos russos - além de outros 3 milhões de euros (R$ 16,11 mi, na cotação atual) por metas atingidas. O jogador, no entanto, não se vê convencido a mudar de ares e ainda não bateu o martelo.\nO próprio Zenit também não trata a negociação como prioridade e tirou o pé há alguns dias. A equipe de São Petersburgo foca em outras tratativas que serão desenroladas durante a janela de transferências.\nO Verdão e o antigo estafe de Artur foram as partes que mais se mostraram empolgadas com o fechamento do negócio. O clube alviverde, no início, até foi relutante, já que firmou o retorno do atacante recentemente, em março de 2023, mas considerou o valor oferecido pelos russos, já que os números, contando as bonificações, representam o dobro do que foi investido em menos de um ano.\nOutro motivo que faz a direção palmeirense considerar negociar o camisa 14 é o desempenho em campo. Importante no seu retorno ao Palmeiras, o jogador terminou a temporada perdendo espaço na equipe titular e fora da espinha dorsal da equipe montada pelo técnico Abel Ferreira.\nAinda que não esteja dando muita atenção para a negociação, o Zenit mantém o interesse em ter Artur. Assim, a decisão sobre a evolução das tratativas passa diretamente pelo atleta.\nComo trocou recentemente de agente, o atacante tem vivido menos \"pressão\" para definir o futuro profissional e reflete sobre a situação enquanto passa férias no Ceará.",

    "text": "*The views expressed in this article are those of Rebecca Thistlethwaite’s and not those of Oregon State University where NMPAN is housed. Feel free to reach out to Rebecca if you have a different opinion or if you have a related story to share. She wants to hear from you! thistler@oregonstate.edu.\nAs you have probably seen on the national news, many federal grant programs have been frozen due to President Trump’s executive orders. This means they are not making payments or reimbursements on millions of dollars of grants.\nEven though two judges have issued temporary restraining orders directing the federal government to continue funding their existing grant contracts, many government departments and agencies are still not processing payments after Jan. 19, 2025. The meat and poultry industry, unfortunately, is experiencing this as well. Hundreds of grants have been made to this sector over the last few years as a result of the Biden administration’s efforts to diversify the meat processing industry and make it more resilient to shocks, as well as provide more options to meat producers.\nThese grants include MPIRG (2 rounds), MPEPP (2 rounds), Local MCap, and the Indigenous Animals Harvesting and Meat Processing Grant Program (IAG) grants. Other related grants to meat producers and processors, such as the Value-Added Producer Grants, Local Food Promotion Program grants, Renewable Energy for America Grants, NRCS grants, and others have been effectively frozen, despite the judge’s orders.\nNMPAN and partners such as American Association of Meat Processors, American Meat Science Association, Flower Hill Institute and others have worked hard to provide outreach and support over the years to help hundreds of small and mid-scale processors know about these grant opportunities and submit successful applications. We have celebrated many of the wins and are now deeply dismayed by those funds being held up. These are real American businesses and lives we are talking about that are being caught in the political crosshairs. At what cost?\nSome of the stories we have been told include the following (names withheld to protect people from political retaliation):\n- $317,645 frozen for a vertically integrated pastured poultry operator for processing equipment, H2A program, and farm water system upgrades\n- $100,000 in refrigeration upgrades frozen for a small custom-exempt operator who was going to go under USDA inspection but now will not be able to\n- $120,000 for a new farmer-owned processing facility to upgrade their humane handling equipment\n- $50,000 to close out a MPIRG grant and finish paying their suppliers for new packaging equipment\nAnd many more ...\nOne person who served as a grant reviewer and read many of these applications had this to say, “As someone who served as a reviewer on these grant applications, I have a deep appreciation for the level of scrutiny and analysis that went into making the final determinations of approved grant recipients. The failure to reimburse grant recipients for previously authorized federal obligations is both illegal and severely wrongheaded.”\nAs AAMP wrote in their recent newsletter article on the same subject- “Furthermore, the money has already been awarded. Companies have poured concrete for new construction and ordered equipment for expanded processing. When the payment is frozen, or worse, canceled, the consequences could drive a small processor out of business.”\nIf you are struggling with frozen grant funds or if you believe this situation is unfair, we encourage you to reach out to your elected officials and let them know your opinions. Use this search page to find your US Representative or Senator’s contact information.\nNMPAN will continue to provide technical assistance to small and mid-scale meat processors and producers despite the freeze. Although some of our funding is also unknown, we will continue to provide the highest level of service to the hundreds of stakeholders we help every year. We are more resolute than ever in our commitment to you and the niche meat industry.",
