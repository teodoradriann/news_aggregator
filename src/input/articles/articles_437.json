    "text": "Alysha Newman, Canada's pole vaulting star, is not just content with breaking records; she's on a mission to soar even higher. After setting a new indoor Canadian record at 4.83m in France, Newman is eyeing another record-breaking performance at the World Athletics Indoor Championships in Glasgow, Scotland. Her recent achievements and ambitions signal a strong comeback, fueled by newfound joy in the sport and a supportive team.\nRecord-Breaking Aspirations\nNewman's recent record of 4.83 meters at a meet in Rouen, France, has set the stage for her next challenge at the World Athletics Indoor Championships. With the competition just around the corner, Newman is determined to outdo herself and break the Canadian record once again. Her confidence is high, thanks to a special pole that she believes can help her achieve even greater heights, potentially making her a strong contender for Olympic medals in the future.\nConsistency and Confidence\nThe key to Newman's recent success and her goals for the future lies in consistency and the right equipment. Having competed in 11 events since January, including sprints, Newman has shown remarkable consistency, with several jumps over 4.70 meters. This level of performance, she believes, is crucial for competing at the highest levels, including the Olympics. Her coach, Zdenek Krykorka, echoes this sentiment, expressing confidence in Newman's ability to surprise many with her performance this year.\nOvercoming Challenges\nNewman's journey has not been without its challenges, including injuries and doubts about her future in the sport. However, with the support of her team and a renewed love for pole vaulting, she has managed to turn things around. This year, she's putting her focus squarely on her sport, calling it her \"selfish era,\" and it's paying off. As she prepares for the championships in Glasgow, Newman is not just looking to break records; she's aiming to prove to herself and the world that she is far from done.",

    "text": "The Norwegian government announced Thursday it will provide Kyiv with 1 billion Norwegian kroner ($94 million) to boost air defense systems in Ukraine.\n“The Ukrainians need more air defense to protect the population against Russian bombs and missiles,” said Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store.\nThe move comes after Moscow was accused of hitting the largest children's hospital in Kyiv with a cruise missile Monday which killed 43 victims, including children. Nearly 200 others were injured in the attack.\nRussia has repeatedly denied striking the hospital and alleged a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile was responsible.\n“The brutal attacks we have seen this past week show why it is so vital for the Ukrainians to have greater protection from Russian air attacks. In cooperation with Germany, Norway will donate a compete IRIS-T air defense battery to Ukraine this autumn,” said Store.\nFor Kyiv, support for air defense has been a top priority.\n“The Ukrainians themselves have the best insight into what is needed, so we are in close contact with Ukraine when determining how we should target our support to the country,” Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide was quoted in the statement.\nIn addition, the Nordic country is providing funds for the international effort to repair and maintain air defense equipment in Ukraine. The support is being carried out via third countries, according to the statement.\nNorway is a major contributor to Ukraine's air defense and the developer of the NASAMS air defense system.\n“A great deal of excellent work is being done in the three coalitions that Norway has chosen to give priority. One of the most important things we can do in the air defense coalition is get military equipment to Ukraine quickly,” Defense Minister Bjorn Arild Gram said in the statement.\nOslo has designated that up to 4 billion Norwegian kroner under the Nansen Support Program for Kyiv will be used to fund air defense measures through 2024.\nThe government confirmed that a large part of the funding will be channeled to Germany's Immediate Action for Air Defense initiative to quickly enhance Ukraine's air defense systems.\n# air defense # Norway # Ukraine",

    "text": "The Commission on Elections (Comelec) has disqualified Cagayan Governor Manuel Mamba from the 2022 National and Local Elections (NLE) for violating the Omnibus Election Code (OEC).\nIn a decision released by the Comelec First Division, Mamba was disqualified for defying OEC provisions, which prohibit the release, disbursement, or expenditure of public funds for any and all kinds of public works from March 25, 2022 until May 8, 2022.\nThe poll body also declared the position of governor of Cagayan as vacant and will automatically be filled in by the vice governor in accordance with the law on succession.\nVictorio Casauay filed the complaint against Mamba. Other respondents in the complaint were Mabel Mamba and Francisco Mamba III, who ran for vice governor and representative of the third district of Cagayan, respectively, in the 2022 NLE but lost their candidacies.\nCasauay said that the then candidates used public funds in providing financial aid, scholarship grants, and various transport vehicles to their constituents during the 45-day prohibition period.\nIn a statement, the poll body noted that “Mamba is incorrect in claiming that the prohibition does not extend to local government units.”\n“This prohibition aims to prevent the use of public funds for campaign purposes, and it serves a deterrent effect on incumbent public officials having control and access to public funds from using the same in furtherance of their own political interests,” the Comelec said.\nOn the other hand, the Comelec cleared Mamba from vote buying allegations, noting that the source of the election paraphernalia bearing his name and containing P1,000 bill could not be verified, thus his culpability cannot be established.\nMeanwhile, Mamba has filed a motion for reconsideration before the Comelec to appeal the disqualification order against him, according to the Cagayan Public Information Office (CPIO).\n“In this regard, Governor Manuel Mamba will remain and continue to serve as governor of the province while there is no final decision yet,” the CPIO said.",

Enjoy and ignore trolls who grabbed my phone.

    "text": "PG&E Takes Action to Aid Recovery from Hurricane Helene [Henry Turner](https://investorshangout.com/profile/view?id=79353)Updated: 10-03-2024 05:54 PM PG&E Teams Up to Tackle Hurricane Helene Aftermath In a commendable effort to support hurricane recovery, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) is dispatching an Incident Management Team along with over 400 skilled workers to assist in restoring power in the wake of Hurricane Helene's devastation. This mutual assistance embodies the spirit of solidarity that prevails in the utility industry. Massive Response to Hurricane Helene's Destruction The coordinated response will see PG&E workers departing from California, ready to collaborate with other utility personnel across North America. With over 300 trucks being sent, the scale of this operation speaks to the significant challenge of restoring power to thousands left in darkness. Impact of Hurricane Helene As a Category 4 hurricane, Helene wrought catastrophic effects after making landfall. It swept across multiple states, including Georgia, South and North Carolina, plunging over 900,000 residents into darkness. This hurricane is reportedly the deadliest in five decades, claiming numerous lives and displacing many more. PG&E stands with the affected communities during this challenging time. Collaboration Across Utility Sectors Angie Gibson, PG&E's Vice President of Emergency Preparedness & Response, underscored the importance of mutual aid among utility companies, stating, \"When the chips are down, we start our crews and blue trucks rolling to help. And other companies do the same for us when we need assistance.\" This cooperation is vital for efficient disaster response. Recent Mutual Aid Highlights In the past few years, PG&E has exemplified its commitment to cooperative support. For example, they assisted Pacific Power in August 2023 during the Smith River Complex Fires, providing both personnel and crucial equipment. Similar efforts were made in 2018 when PG&E traveled to Massachusetts to support local utility efforts after devastating explosions. Efforts During Previous Disasters Historically, PG&E's involvement extends to major hurricane recovery efforts, including deployments after Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and Hurricane Irma in Florida. These extensive recovery missions highlight PG&E's expertise and readiness to respond to various natural disasters. Supporting a Nationwide Response As organizations rally together during Hurricane Helene's aftermath, the Edison Electric Institute reported an astounding 50,000 workers from at least 40 states and Canada are involved in this emergency response. PG&E's contribution is remarkably significant among this vast network, showcasing the united front of utility companies. Power Restoration Progress With nearly 6 million customers initially impacted by Hurricane Helene, progress is being made as approximately 4.51 million have seen their power restored. This diligent work underlines the commitment from all involved to expedite recovery efforts and assist affected communities effectively. Conclusion: A Heartfelt Commitment PG&E's Senior Vice President of Electric Operations, Peter Kenny, expressed empathy for the victims of Hurricane Helene, reflecting on the devastation caused. He voices gratitude for those who serve, emphasizing the relentless nature of support—both in Georgia and California. PG&E remains dedicated to restoring power and offering aid where it is most needed. Frequently Asked Questions What is the primary purpose of PG&E's deployment?

    "text": "Le Monégasque Takumi Minamino (à droite) et le Japon ont chuté face à Hussein Ali et l’Irak. (M. Darlington/Reuters)\nFavori de la compétition, le Japon s’est incliné vendredi face à l’Irak (2-1). La sélection nippone pourrait tout de même se qualifier pour les huitièmes en cas de succès mercredi contre l’Indonésie.\nFin de série pour le Japon. L’équipe nippone s’est inclinée vendredi lors de son deuxième match de Coupe d’Asie contre l’Irak (2-1). Le Japon n’avait pas perdu un match depuis le mois de mars 2023, enchaînant une série de 12 victoires d’affilée.\nLe match a rapidement tourné au cauchemar pour les Samouraïs Blues. Dès la 5e minute de jeu, Aymen Hussein inscrivait le premier but de la rencontre après une très mauvaise relance du gardien japonais, Zion Suzuki. Hussein doublait la mise pour l’Irak avant la fin de la première période, grâce à un bon centre d’Ahmed Al-Hajjaj (45e+4).\nlire aussi\nCalendrier et classements de la Coupe d’Asie\nAu retour des vestiaires, les hommes d’Hajime Moriyasu tentaient le tout pour le tout avec des assauts répétés sur la partie de terrain irakienne et une très nette domination (73 % de possession). Le manque de réalisme de Takuma Asano, aligné en pointe de l’attaque, n’a pas non plus aidé le Japon à revenir au score. Le défenseur de Liverpool, Wataru Endo, réduisait l’écart en fin de match (90e+3) mais trop tard.\nGrâce à cette victoire, l’Irak passe premier du groupe D avec 6 points. Le Japon occupe quant à lui la deuxième place avec 3 points. En cas de victoire contre l’Indonésie, mercredi prochain, la sélection nippone pourrait tout de même se qualifier pour les huitièmes de finale, en seconde position derrière l’Irak, si celle-ci ne perd pas face au Vietnam.\nlire aussi\nToute l’actualité du football",

    "title": "Unos 33,000 trabajadores de Boeing se declaran en huelga",
    "text": "Decenas de miles de trabajadores de [Boeing](https://es.theepochtimes.com/focus/boeing) abandonaron el trabajo el 13 de septiembre tras rechazar un acuerdo contractual, lo que representa la primera huelga desde 2008. Miembros de dos sindicatos locales, de la Asociación Internacional de Maquinistas y Trabajadores Aeroespaciales, votaron con abrumadora mayoría el jueves por la noche para rechazar la última oferta de contrato e iniciar una huelga. Según los sindicatos, el 94.6 por ciento votó a favor de rechazar el contrato y el 96 por ciento apoyó el abandono del trabajo. La huelga comenzó a medianoche. Los trabajadores en huelga, unos 33,000, representan el 22% de la plantilla de Boeing. La empresa, con sede en Virginia, fabrica aviones y otros productos. Boeing y los sindicatos dijeron el fin de semana que habían llegado a un acuerdo provisional sobre un nuevo contrato, que incluía cambios como el aumento del salario base inicial de al menos 12 dólares la hora a 21 dólares la hora, así como la opción de recibir una pensión como pago único al jubilarse. «Hemos conseguido todo lo que podíamos en la negociación, cercanos a la huelga. Nosotros recomendamos la aceptación porque no podemos garantizar que podamos conseguir más en una huelga. Pero esa es su decisión y es una decisión que protegeremos y apoyaremos, pase lo que pase», dijo Jon Holden, presidente del sindicato Aerospace Machinists District 751, en una carta abierta el lunes. Al anunciar el resultado de la votación días después, Holden dijo que la huelga «es acerca de respeto, esto es acerca de abordar el pasado y es acerca de luchar por nuestro futuro». «Nosotros estaremos en huelga a medianoche», dijo el presidente, mientras los miembros coreaban: «¡Huelga! ¡Huelga! Huelga». La Asociación Internacional de Maquinistas y Trabajadores Aeroespaciales afirmó que apoyaba la huelga. «Estamos increíblemente orgullosos del duro trabajo y dedicación mostrados por los equipos negociadores del Distrito 751 y W24 y de la inquebrantable solidaridad de nuestros miembros. Sus incansables esfuerzos han quedado patentes a lo largo de todo este proceso. Ahora, se reagruparán y comenzarán a planificar los próximos pasos para garantizar un acuerdo que nuestros miembros puedan aprobar», dijo la asociación en un comunicado. Boeing indicó en una declaración el jueves que «seguimos comprometidos a restablecer nuestra relación con nuestros empleados y el sindicato, y estamos dispuestos a volver a la mesa para llegar a un nuevo acuerdo». La huelga de Boeing del año 2008 duró 52 días y costó a Boeing unos 100 millones de dólares diarios. El contrato que se alcanzó para poner fin a la huelga se prorrogó dos veces. Según una nota previa a la votación del banco de inversión TD Cowen, una huelga de 50 días podría costarle a Boeing entre 3000 y 3500 millones de dólares de flujo de caja. Los trabajadores en huelga trabajan principalmente en las zonas de Seattle y Portland, donde construyen el 737 MAX y otros aviones. «La pregunta clave ahora es sobre la duración de la huelga dada la brecha entre el aumento salarial propuesto y la petición de los miembros del sindicato», dijo el analista de Jefferies Chloe Lemarie en una nota, añadiendo que una huelga larga representa un riesgo clave para los niveles de producción del 737 MAX. Poco después de medianoche, los trabajadores en huelga empezaron a concentrarse ante las entradas de las fábricas de Boeing en la zona de Seattle. Muchos ondeaban pancartas en las que se leía: «En huelga contra Boeing», mientras los conductores pasaban y hacían sonar las bocinas de sus coches. «Estoy dispuesto a hacer huelga durante dos meses o incluso más. Vamos el tiempo que haga falta para conseguir lo que nos merecemos», dijo James Mann, un joven de 26 años que trabaja en una división de alas en Boeing. Ni la Casa Blanca ni los candidatos presidenciales, la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris y el expresidente Donald Trump, han hecho comentarios sobre la huelga por el momento.

    "title": "Walid Regragui pleased as Morocco begin Afcon 2023 with 'important' win over Tanzania",
    "text": "Morocco manager Walid Regragui said he was pleased with his team’s opening performance at the Africa Cup of Nations on Wednesday after the World Cup semi-finalists eased to a 3-0 victory over Tanzania.\nCaptain Romain Saiss, Azzedine Ounahi and Youssef En-Nesyri all netted for Morocco in the Ivorian coastal city of San-Pedro, while Tanzania had Novatus Miroshi sent off.\n“First matches are always difficult, and the humidity made this one tough, but we respected Tanzania,” said Regragui after Wednesday’s Group F clash.\n“The team’s spirit was very good and we got an important win.”\nAlthough an African powerhouse for decades and one of the pre-tournament favourites, Morocco are seeking only a second Afcon title, 48 years after lifting the trophy in Ethiopia.\nMorocco sprang to international prominence just over a year ago in Qatar when they became the first African World Cup semi-finalists, eliminating Spain and Portugal along the way.\nMorocco began with seven of the team that started in the 2-0 World Cup semi-final loss to France in Qatar. There were three La Liga players, two each from the Premier League and Ligue 1 and two with Saudi Pro League sides.\nThis contrasted sharply with Tanzania, whose line-up included Tarryn Allarakhia from English fifth-tier outfit Wealdstone. The winger struggled in sweltering conditions and was replaced after 38 minutes, by which time Morocco were already ahead.\nHakim Ziyech, on loan at Galatasaray from Chelsea, lifted a free kick over the defensive wall and when goalkeeper Aisha Manula failed to grasp it, Saiss converted the loose ball.\nTanzanian hopes of finding an equaliser suffered a huge blow with 20 minutes remaining when Miroshi fouled Ounahi and was sent off for a second booking.\nOunahi rounded off a fine move to make it 2-0 on 77 minutes, and the scoring was complete shortly after when En-Nesyri converted a low cross for a goal that was confirmed as onside following a VAR check.\n“We wanted to score early and had chances, but the goal finally came from a set piece. Once we scored, that was the hard part done,” Regragui said. “At times in the second half, we accepted not having the ball and managed the game like a great team.”\nRegragui believes Morocco benefitted from being one of the last teams to play their opening group game, allowing the manager to analyse where other sides struggled in the conditions.\nTanzania manager Adel Amrouche admitted his team were outclassed by Morocco. AFP\n“Seeing their first matches allowed us to avoid the same mistakes,” he said. “We noticed many sides declined physically in the second half, so we prepared to stay fresh.”\nMorocco face DR Congo in their second Group F match on Sunday and another victory will send them through to the last 16.\nTanzania, meanwhile, will take on Zambia on the same day, and manager Adel Amrouche admitted the gulf in class between his side and Morocco proved the difference on Wednesday.\n“Our gameplan failed. We did not expect this scenario but I congratulate Morocco for their performance and result,” he said. “The quality of Morocco’s players made the difference and they deserved to win.”",

    "text": "In the Far East of Russia, a passenger plane carrying 34 people made an emergency landing on a frozen river, presumably due to a pilot error.\nThe Soviet-era Antonov An-24 aircraft operated by Polar Airlines came to an abrupt stop on Thursday morning on the frozen River Kolyma, not far from land. Fortunately, no one was injured.\nThe aircraft touched down on the Zyryanka airport\nrunway.\nProsecutors said that initial investigations indicated pilot error was the cause. On board were thirty passengers and four crew members.\nEarly on Thursday, the Sakha republic’s capital city of Yakutsk in the Far East of Russia saw the departure of Flight PI217.\nIt was bound for Zyryanka, 1,100km (685 miles) to the north-east, and was due to fly on to another small town in Srednekolymsk before returning to Yakutsk.\nVideo from one of the passengers showed the plane almost in the centre of the frozen River Kolyma in eastern Siberia. Temperatures in Zyryanka dip to around -40C at this time of year.\nProsecutors said the plane had landed on a sand bank in the river. A trail in the snow revealed how long it had taken to come to a standstill. (Agencies)\n Copy 29/12/2023 25",
