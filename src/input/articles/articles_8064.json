    "title": "'May this keep you safe from harm': WWII era Bible returned to New York veteran's family",
    "text": "Lost Bible returned to slain USAAF airman from World War II [Saleen Martin](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/7245115001/saleen-martin/) During World War II, a woman bought three brothers Bibles to protect their hearts and guide them as they set out for battle. The Bible had a metal cover on the front with the inscription “May this keep you safe from harm.\" Two of the brothers made it home, while the other, Lt. Edsel J. McKnight of the United States Army Air Forces, was shot down off the coast of France. His Bible was mailed to the family but was lost sometime after. This month, his family finally got it back. Ava Coogan's family is from Albany, New York and they found the Bible in late December while going through their late matriarch’s belongings. On Jan. 11, Coogan met Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law and returned the Bible to her, allowing her to put it back in its rightful place, next to the ones his brothers brought back home from war. ‘I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages’ Coogan’s uncle and mother found the Bible in a stack of books. Their mother, Rosanne Vartanian, died nearly 20 years ago but was a collector and loved garage sales. “It’s just so random that my grandmother had the urge to pick that up,” she said. “She bought random things. There was no rhyme or reason to it. It was with a stack of other books.” Coogan decided to research the Bible and found out soldiers often took them to war. Some can be found in museums. “The whole premise of it was that the metal cover on the front is like a hard shield,” Coogan told USA TODAY. “They would put it in their coat pockets … like the front breast pocket … that cover would protect their heart from bullets.” Lt. McKnight’s name was also written in the Bible, said Coogan, who was drawn to the Bible for some reason. She couldn’t put it down, she recalled. “I kept playing with it and flipping through the pages,” she said. She noticed that the Bible’s front cover had a slice in it, almost like something was underneath it. She examined it more closely and found a piece of paper folded up inside. She asked her uncle for help, who carefully used a butter knife to get the slip of paper out. Once they retrieved the piece of paper from under the Bible’s cover, they saw that it was a plea for the Bible’s safe return to an address not too far away. Although there was no area code, there was a phone number listed, so the family added their own area code and called. “I was just hoping for the best,” Coogan said. “We found out that number worked.” Lieutenant was shot down off the coast of France When Coogan's uncle called the number written in the note, he spoke to a woman named Fay, Lt. McKnight’s sister-in-law. The families organized a meetup on Jan. 11 to return the Bible to the McKnights, who are from Porter Corners, part of Saratoga County in eastern New York. Lt. McKnight served in the U.S. Air Force’s 365th Fighter Group and 388th Fighter Squadron. He was flying in a Thunderbolt fighter aircraft in 1944 when he was shot down off the coast of France, [online records](https://rafbeaulieu.co.uk/honouring-the-airmen-of-raf-beaulieu/) show. Fay told Coogan and her family that Lt. McKnight has two brothers. All three of the brothers served in WWII. Fay’s husband, Ray, said his Bible saved his life. “He got shot during the war and it hit where the Bible was, covering his heart, and the bullet went into his arm instead,” Coogan said. Once Lt. McKnight was killed, his belongings were shipped back home to the family. His sister-in-law had all three Bibles on a bookshelf on display. One day, the family was preparing to go to church. Her nephew borrowed the Bible, but knew it was so precious, the family decided to write a note with contact information in case it were ever lost. “He didn't lose it,” Coogan said. “He brought it back after church and I guess what happened is after someone passed in their family, they had an estate sale … and it just accidentally went out with a stack of books.” It ended up in Coogan’s grandmother’s hands, she said. Returning the Bible to the McKnight family was quite the enlightening experience, Coogan said. “That was really cool because that's when we kind of got to hear their story,” she said.",

She plays unseeded Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova next.\nAustralian Open winner Sinner was similarly untroubled in dispatching American Alex Michelsen 6-4 6-0 6-2, taking just 99 minutes to complete his ATP Tour-leading 30th hardcourt win of the year.\nThe Italian, who will play Australian Chris O'Connell next, has been dogged by controversy at Flushing Meadows after it was revealed days before the tournament he escaped a ban and was cleared of wrongdoing despite failing two drug tests this year.\nHe said he tested positive for a banned substance after his physio applied an over-the-counter spray to a cut on his own hand before carrying out treatments in March.\nSinner fired both his physio and trainer last week.\n\"Not easy, obviously, to find now in the middle of the season, you know, the physical trainer and the physio,\" said Sinner. \"We try our best to find the best people, and then we see.\"\nTwice champion Naomi Osaka was sent packing by Czech Karolina Muchova 6-3 7-6(5), another disappointing Grand Slam exit in what she has dubbed her \"learning year\" after coming back from a 15-month maternity break.\n\"I feel like I'm working way harder than I've ever worked in my life, so it needs to turn into something,\" said Osaka. \"Well, it doesn't need to, but I think it will.\"\nMuchova, a semi-finalist last year, will next play Russian Anastasia Potapova.\nFormer champion Daniil Medvedev moved past Hungarian Fabian Marozsan 6-3 6-2 7-6, helped by his opponent's 45 unforced errors, and will next play Italian Flavio Cobolli.\nSixth seed Jessica Pegula and 14th seed Tommy Paul boosted home hopes as both Americans advanced to the third round but compatriot Sebastian Korda crashed out.\nDefending champion Coco Gauff will hope to keep the good times rolling for the home crowd when she opens up the action at Arthur Ashe against Ukrainian Elina Svitolina today.\nBen Shelton and Frances Tiafoe promise fireworks in an all-American third-round clash.\nLatest Tennis US Open: Carlos Alcaraz press conference following his defeat to Botic van De Zandschulp\n‘It was a fight against myself’ – Carlos Alcaraz in shock straight-sets defeat at US Open\nNovak Djokovic makes history at US Open with Coco Gauff safely through\nUS Open press conference with Novak Djokovic\n‘I cannot really control what they think’ – Jannik Sinner gets frosty player reception after anti-doping controversy\nEmma Raducanu going ‘back to the drawing board’ after US Open loss\nLongest US Open match in US Open history at 5 hours 35 minutes won by Dan Evans\n‘Yeah, I feel down, like I feel sad’ – Questions remain over direction of Emma Raducanu’s career after US Open loss\nStefanos Tsitsipas crashes out as Naomi Osaka serves notice in US Open\nAustralian teen may miss out on $140,000 US Open payday due to rules about student athletes\nShow more Top Stories\nParalympics Breaking | ‘I know I can go faster’ - Ireland’s Ellen Keane storms into 100m Breaststroke final after winning heat in Paris\nComment Tanya Sweeney: Celebs like Blake Lively are rude to journalists because they think we’re ‘the help’ — and it happens more than you think\nTelevision Pat Stacey: Return of awful ‘2 Johnnies’ show hard to credit but low-key RTÉ schedule has some gems\nMusic ‘Even if we worked in the local fishmongers, we’d still be slapping each other with the trout.’ The caustic put-downs that propelled the Gallagher brothers' feud Latest News More Irish News Oasis in Dublin: Everything you need to know about tickets, pre-sale access and how to prepare for Ticketmaster 12:57 Celebrity News Oasis release Definitely Maybe anniversary edition as reunion pre-sale begins 12:30 Britain Public fury as Conservative MP uses Holocaust poem to attack smoking ban 12:29 Irish Business Corre secures loan from shareholders 12:28 News Destructive larch beetle detected in Scottish log import into Cork 12:28 Paralympics Breaking | ‘I know I can go faster’ - Ireland’s Ellen Keane storms into 100m Breaststroke final after winning heat in Paris 11:57 Asia-Pacific Indonesia to reform tourism on tropical island Bali: ‘Quality is more important than numbers’ 11:48 Personal Finance Just released Eurozone inflation figures leave ECB on course for rate cuts 11:46 Seachtain An ‘Sos Cogaidh’ 30 bliana ar aghaidh: The impact of the IRA’s ceasefire 11:35 Premier League Manchester United v Liverpool: Arne Slot full press conference 11:31",

    "title": "Lula diz que igreja tem papel vital em país mais justo, em carta para Marcha para Jesus",
    "text": "Quer se manter informado, ter acesso a mais de 60 colunistas e reportagens exclusivas?Assine o Estadão aqui! BRASÍLIA - O Palácio do Planalto divulgou na tarde desta quinta-feira, 30, uma carta do presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) lida durante a Marcha para Jesus, que acontece em São Paulo. Na mensagem, Lula tece elogios ao evento, lembra de ter sancionado a lei que criou o Dia Nacional da Marcha para Jesus em 2009 e afirma que a Igreja desempenha um “papel vital” no compromisso de construir um país mais “justo e inclusivo”, que, diz, norteia as ações do governo federal. Presidente não compareceu à Marcha para Jesus e foi representado pelo ministro da Advocacia-Geral da União, Jorge Messias Foto: WILTON JUNIOR/ ESTADÃO Na carta, o presidente diz também que, como cristão, se sente “regozijado de ver a dimensão extraordinária” que o evento tomou e o papel significativo que desempenha na vida de muitos brasileiros, “promovendo valores de paz, fé, amor ao próximo e solidariedade”. Escreve também ser sempre “uma honra e uma alegria” receber o convite para participar da celebração. “Quero expressar meu respeito e meu reconhecimento pela realização de mais uma edição deste evento, que reúne milhares de fiéis em um momento de fé, unidade e oração”, afirma. O presidente foi convidado a participar da marcha, mas foi representado pelo ministro da Advocacia-Geral da União (AGU), Jorge Messias, como ocorreu no ano passado. Evangélico, Messias é considerado uma ponte entre o governo Lula e essa vertente religiosa, com a qual a gestão petista tenta se aproximar. “Temos o compromisso profundo, com todos os brasileiros, de construir um país mais justo e inclusivo. As ações do meu governo são desenvolvidas a partir dessa premissa e buscam promover uma vida digna à família brasileira. E a Igreja desempenha um papel vital nesse compromisso, que se reflete na sua ação social e no suporte espiritual de seus fiéis. Por isso, acredito que, juntos, podemos fazer muito mais pelo bem-estar, a paz e a harmonia de nosso povo”, afirma. Leia também “Uma das características mais formidáveis da Marcha é a capacidade de reunir fiéis de diferentes igrejas cristãs do Brasil e do mundo, sendo um evento aberto e de inclusão, que permite a participação de toda a população. Isso é uma demonstração inequívoca da prática daquilo que nos ensinou Jesus: ‘a comunhão’, que promove e fortalece os vínculos entre as pessoas. Conforme nos mandou Jesus: ‘amem-se uns aos outros. Assim como eu amei vocês, vocês devem se amar uns aos outros. Se vocês tiverem amor uns para com os outros, todos reconhecerão que vocês são meus discípulos’ (Jo 13,25-26). Esse ensinamento é o que norteia o trabalho do nosso governo, que tem um foco muito preciso: união e reconstrução”, diz o presidente. Lula ainda afirma ter “certeza” de que a Marcha para Jesus deste ano será, como nos anos anteriores, “um evento abençoado, que renovará a esperança e a fé de todos os participantes”. “Como, infelizmente, não consegui estar presente, pedi ao ministro-chefe da Advocacia-Geral da União, Jorge Messias, que representasse a mim e ao governo. Ele está honrado, como também estou. Que Deus abençoe a todos”, conclui o petista.",

    "text": "During the Christmas period, parts of South America experienced intense showers and thunderstorms, resulting in substantial rainfall in various regions. On Monday, more than 100mm of rain fell in the Catamarca province in Argentina , which led to flash floods. A sudden surge in river water levels then caused the collapse of a pedestrian bridge, which was the only link between the towns of Rincón and Pomán. While many other roads in the region were damaged and houses were flooded, no casualties were reported.\nThe unique topography of Catamarca aided the formation of a near-stationary convective shower over Pomán, unleashing several hours of torrential rain and causing catastrophic flooding.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo has also been affected by severe rainfall over the past week. On Tuesday night, heavy rains hit the eastern region, resulting in flooding, mudslides and landslides. So far, 40 bodies have been recovered in Bukavu and the surrounding areas. This comes less than a week after 20 people were killed in similar conditions in the Mwenga territory of South Kivu.\nNorth-west India has been experiencing poor visibility over the past few days. Delhi has been particularly badly affected, with visibility plummeting to close to zero metres between 8am and 10am on Wednesday. Parts of Pakistan were also badly affected by the dense fog on Wednesday.\nWidespread disruption to road, rail and air networks was reported by both countries, alongside several severe road incidents. Fog forms when air is cooled to the dew point – the temperature at which water vapour condenses – essentially forming a cloud at surface level.\nTemperatures across Pakistan and north-west India have been lower than usual, helping fog to develop. When fog is combined with pollutants, smog develops. This has widely been seen across north-west India, with air quality being classified as very poor by the India Meteorological Department, which could pose serious health risks.\nNorthern Turkey also experienced dense fog on Thursday. This led to a serious road crash involving seven vehicles, including three buses, killing 10 people and injuring 57 others.\nExplore more on these topics Extreme weather Weather tracker Democratic Republic of the Congo Africa Argentina India Pakistan Turkey analysis\nReuse this content",

    "text": "“Avvertiamo oggi un diffuso bisogno di spiritualità, un desiderio che si incontra in moltissime persone di tutte le età, ed è esattamente questo desiderio alla base delle proposte diocesane di scuola di preghiera”, si legge in una nota della diocesi di Mantova che presenta “Dal mio cuore sgorgano parole di bellezza”, percorso in tre tappe, in tre giovedì di aprile, all’eremo della Ghisiola di Castiglione delle Stiviere, “per risvegliare l’uomo interiore e imparare a pregare coi sensi del cuore”. Perché la Bibbia “non è solo un libro di parole rivolte a noi da Dio ma anche di preghiere che l’uomo innalza a Dio”. La Bibbia – diceva D. Bonhoeffer – “contiene anche le parole che Dio vuole sentirsi rivolgere da noi. Il salmo è parola di risposta, ma, anche nella risposta, è Dio che prende la parola, perché non possiamo ‘dire niente a Dio senza di lui’ (Agostino)”. Questa edizione della Scuola di preghiera, si legge ancora nella presentazione, “ri-consegna la preghiera delle ore, nella preghiera liturgica viviamo tanto la preghiera personale quanto quella comunitaria”. Si inizia giovedì 4 aprile (ore 20:45, stesso orario per i tre appuntamenti) con “Leggere i salmi con l’uomo” – “Beato l’uomo che medita la sua legge giorno e notte: i salmi, un libro per meditare”. Il secondo incontro, l’11 aprile, dedicato a “Leggere con Cristo i salmi di Israele”, avrà come tema “Bisogna che si compiano tutte le cose scritte nei Salmi: i salmi, la voce di Davide e quella di Cristo”. Infine, il 18 aprile, “Leggere i salmi con la Chiesa” avrà come tema “Come è bello che i fratelli vivano insieme: i salmi, preghiera della Chiesa (Sal 133)”. A tutti gli incontri parteciperà il vescovo Marco Busca. Iscrizioni su questo [modulo online](https://forms.gle/H8Fed2HUNw3XgT2NA)",

    "title": "Mateo Berry Returns With Reserved Essentials And Signature Cargo Pant",
    "text": "Mateo Berry Elevates Streetwear and Skate Culture With Reserved Essentials\nThe relaunch of Reserved Essential marks a significant moment for the brand and its founder, Mateo Berry , whose journey through the fashion world has been one of innovation, creativity, and influence. As a Honduran-American fashion designer, entrepreneur, visual artist, and creative consultant, Berry has carved out a niche in the industry, blending his deep-rooted passion for streetwear culture with luxury fashion.\nRaised in Los Angeles, California, Berry's early exposure to visual arts came through his involvement in skateboarding. This subculture, known for its unique aesthetic and rebellious spirit, fueled his interest in art, fashion, and music. Berry began exploring these interests on a broader scale, eventually leading to the creation of \" The Come Up TV \" during his college years.\nThe lifestyle blog became a platform for showcasing collaborative visuals and interviews with creatives on the rise. Berry’s keen eye for talent led him to feature artists like Big Sean, Drake, Kid Cudi, Lupe Fiasco, Pusha T, and Wiz Khalifa, many of whom were in the early stages of their careers. Berry’s ability to capture the zeitgeist of the emerging streetwear scene quickly garnered attention and helped his transition into the fashion industry.\nIn 2012, Berry took on a freelance photography role with Blvck Scale, a brand synonymous with the intersection of streetwear and high fashion. His collaboration with ASAP Rocky on the Blvck ASAP capsule collection not only solidified his place in the industry but also showcased his talent for visual storytelling. Berry’s photograph of Rocky’s first solo tour poster became an iconic image, gracing magazine covers, billboards, ads, and tour merchandise.\nBerry's tenure as the general manager at Black Scale further expanded his influence, as he oversaw the brand’s LA and NY storefronts, helping to shape the direction of the label during a pivotal time. His experience with Black Scale set the stage for his next venture with Stone Island in 2016. Here, Berry played a crucial role in opening the brand’s first American flagship location and immersed himself in studying luxury sportswear design in Italy—a move that would heavily influence his future work.\nBerry would relocate to London to conceptualize and design Reserved Essential after amassing a wealth of experience, and developing a distinct vision for what the brand could become. In December 2017, Reserved Essential made its debut with a collection that was both innovative and deeply rooted in the culture that had shaped Berry’s journey. The collection was met with enthusiasm, landing placements with prominent publications, and catching the eye of celebrity stylists.\n\"Reserved Essential was born out of this idea to create a mixed media site where I could showcase everything I was doing,\" Berry explains. “It started with a blog, some merch, and photography—just a reflection of my lifestyle. People connected with it so much that they said, 'This should be your brand.' At the time, I was helping friends with their projects, but never really focusing on myself.”\n“That push is what made me turn it into something bigger. They encouraged me to turn it into a full-fledged brand.\" Reserved Essentials was born, blending Berry’s artistic vision with his deep-rooted connection to the digital era, and street culture on the West Coast.\nReserved Essential quickly became a favorite among celebrities, with designs worn by people like Billie Eilish, Future, Travis Scott, Michael B. Jordan, Young Thug, and Juice WRLD. The brand's ability to resonate with such a diverse group of influencers speaks to Berry’s unique approach to design, and one that merges the raw, unfiltered energy of street culture with the sophistication of luxury fashion.\nThe upcoming relaunch of Reserved Essential is a reaffirmation of Berry’s vision and the brand’s place in the fashion landscape. The signature camouflage cargo pants in corduroy material push the boundaries of what streetwear can be when fine materials meet edgy ideas. This relaunch builds on the brand's already legacy, bringing new designs that reflect Berry’s ongoing evolution as a designer and his commitment to creating pieces that speak to the next generation of fashion enthusiasts.\nFrom his early days in Los Angeles, where skateboarding was more than just a sport to Berry, it was a gateway to art, music, and fashion. Berry’s journey has been marked by his ability to blend these elements into something truly unique.\n\"Skateboarding was my introduction to everything,\" Berry reflects. \"It wasn't just about the tricks; it was about the culture, the style, the music. It shaped who I am and how I see the world.\" This perspective is evident in his work, particularly in his latest venture, Reserved Essentials, and its offshoot brand, La Sainte-Air , which he describes as \"a brand that wasn’t supposed to be a brand.\"\n\"When I started Reserved Essentials, I wanted it to be more than just clothing,\" Berry shares. \"I wanted it to tell a story, to reflect my experiences and the culture I grew up in. That’s why I included everything from vintage photography to streetwear inspired by the places I’ve been and the people I’ve met.\"\nAs he began to dive deeper into the world of fashion, he found himself gravitating towards vintage hats . \"I started sourcing any vintage hat I could find,\" he recalls. \"But as I talked with friends and collaborators, like H. Lorenzo , I began to focus more on pop culture references - things that people from our generation could really relate to.\"\nThis focus led to the creation of La Sainte-Air, a collection within Reserved Essentials that pays homage to iconic moments in pop culture. \"I wanted everything to be a pop culture reference,\" Berry says. \"From Coca-Cola hats from the eighties to Blink-182 caps, I wanted each piece to be a little slice of history.\" The hats Berry sources are more than just accessories; they are artifacts of a bygone era, meticulously curated to evoke a sense of nostalgia and style.\n\"The sourcing process is time-consuming and tedious,\" he admits. \"But it's worth it when you find that perfect piece, like an original ESPN logo hat from the seventies or a Newport Cigarettes cap. These are not just hats; they're pieces of a cultural narrative that I'm trying to preserve.\"\nBerry’s passion for his work is palpable, especially when he talks about the challenges of maintaining the quality and authenticity of these vintage items. \"I’m very particular about the condition of the hats I source,\" he explains. \"They have to be wearable, not just collectible. I don’t want people to hesitate to wear them because they’re worried about how many heads they’ve touched.\"\n\"When we first launched, the hats sold out almost immediately,\" he says. \"People were trying to collect every color, every style.\" Berry remained grounded in his roots. \"Everything I do is still influenced by skate culture,\" he says. \"It’s the foundation of who I am. Even now, as I work on these projects, I’m always thinking about how it connects back to that community.\"\nBerry’s work with Reserved Essentials and La Sainte-Air is not just about fashion; it’s about storytelling, about preserving the cultural moments that have shaped our world. \"I want to blur the lines between different worlds,\" he concludes. \"Whether it’s a rapper, an athlete, or a chef wearing one of my hats, I want people to see the connection, to understand that culture is fluid, and that we’re all part of this ongoing narrative.\" Berry continues to promote luxury streetwear, proving that fashion is not just about what we wear, it’s about who we are and the stories we carry with us.\nCassell Ferere Following",
