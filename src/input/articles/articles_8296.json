    "title": "B.C. civil lawsuit against Sex Pistols guitarist alleges 1980 sexual assault",
    "text": "VANCOUVER — A Vancouver woman has filed a civil lawsuit against Paramount Pictures Corp. and punk rocker Stephen Jones of The Sex Pistols alleging he sexually assaulted her as a teenager while she was a movie extra more than 40 years ago.\nA B.C. Supreme Court statement of claim filed by the plaintiff says she was 14 years old and working on the movie \"Ladies & Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains\" when Jones supplied her with marijuana, then sexually assaulted her in his hotel room.\nThe court has placed a publication ban on the woman's name.\nHer lawyer Jason Gratl said in an interview that he could not comment about why the lawsuit was brought 44 years after the alleged events.\n\"I only wanted to say one thing and it's that she kept a diary,\" Gratl said.\nThe notice of claim filed Wednesday says Paramount didn't take adequate steps to warn minors or their parents about the risks of working on the set with Jonesor impose contractual terms restricting his contact with young extras or using illicit drugs.\nNone of the allegations have been tested in court.\nParamount did not immediately return a request for comment. Jones could not be reached for comment.\nNeither Paramount, nor Jones have filed a statement of defence.\nThe lawsuit says Paramount hired Jones, who was 24 at the time, for a role in the film because of his reputation as a \"punk rocker\" who consumed excessive amounts of drugs and alcohol, and engaged in sexual misconduct, including with underage girls.\n\"The defendant Paramount was banking on the defendant Jones’ reputation and history to market 'The Fabulous Stains,'\" the statement says, adding the company \"also hired other well-known punk rock musicians as actors for the same purpose.\"\nThe statement says that despite this knowledge, the company did not take steps to protect young workers.\nThe movie, about disaffected teens in a punk rock band, was released in 1982.\nThe legal action says the woman is seeking damages, claiming the alleged assault \"caused her to suffer psychological injury, including loss of self-esteem, loss of self-worth, injurious self-imaging and identity, and loss of trust in intimacy and potential partners.\"\nThe lawsuit says she was hired as one of the hundreds of extras playing fans for the all-girl feminist rock band. Jones had been hired to play the role of a \"socially volatile punk rock guitar player in a fictitious all-male band, The Looters.\"\nIt says that on April 13, 1980, the teen went to the Denman Inn, \"a location under the direction and control\" of Paramount, with the intention of inviting the movie's lead actor, Diane Lane, to go roller skating.\nWhen she entered the lobby, it says Jones approached her, told her he had Lane's number in his hotel room and asked her to go with him to get it. Once they were inside his room, it says Jones gave her marijuana, and he then turned off the lights and closed the curtains.\nThe document says she understood that meant he was likely to make sexual advances, she told Jones she did not consent and was \"only 14, 1-4.\" It says despite this, he pulled her onto his bed, climbed on top of her then kissed and molested her.\n\"The plaintiff repeatedly and expressly told the defendant Jones 'no' and tried to move his hand away, and finally wriggled free from him and left the room,\" the notice of claim says.\nThe lawsuit says she was initially \"both repulsed and flattered by this unwanted sexual attention from someone she believed to be a rock star and movie star.\"\nBecause she was confused by what had happened, the document says she did not tell her parents and it wasn't until she was older that she \"felt sexually violated and sexually ashamed and angry\" about the alleged assault.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published April 25, 2024.\nBrieanna Charlebois, The Canadian Press",

Agregó que, a través de la Junta Municipal de Aguas y Saneamiento (JMAS) se realizan recorridos en las colonias para detectar y reparar de manera gratuita, fugas que se encuentran en el interior de los domicilios. Indicó que con ello se busca evitar el desperdicio de hasta 500 millones de litros de agua al mes, que se pierden por daños no detectados en la red hidráulica. Para la competitividad del estado Pablo Lemus presenta a equipo para impulsar justicia laboral y desarrollo de Jalisco Al momento, se han reparado 3 mil fugas, logrando con ello un doble propósito: respaldar la economía de las familias chihuahuenses y cuidar el líquido primordial para la vida. “Ayúdanos a no desperdiciarla y súmate a Chihuahua sin fugas, ¡Juntos sí podemos cuidar el agua!”, enfatizó la mandataria. Cabe destacar que estas tareas adquieren mayor relevancia ante la temporada de sequía que enfrenta el estado y la necesidad de asegurar que cada hogar cuente con el suministro básico de agua para consumo y realización de actividades cotidianas. Además, como una forma de apoyar a las y los ciudadanos, en lo que resta del año la JMAS aplicará el 100 por ciento de descuento en recargos y 90 por ciento de descuento en adeudos a quienes no hayan podido pagar el agua, drenaje y saneamiento. Durante la visita de la JMAS en la colonia Arboledas, vecinos agradecieron al Gobierno del Estado, por los servicios gratuitos que brindaron, pues no solo beneficia en su economía, si no que previene algún daño más grave a sus viviendas.

    "text": "We’re days away from the end of an incredible year on Wall Street. All the major indexes are up by double-digit percentages as we close out 2023. Notably, the S&P 500 runs 24% higher and the Nasdaq 100 is up an incredible 54%. It’s the complete opposite of what investors saw last year. Yet that’s the thing with [sharp market corrections](https://investorplace.com/2023/11/7-dividend-stocks-every-investor-should-own-to-survive-a-market-crash/). Bear markets are typically measured in months where bull markets that inevitably follow are measured in years. While no one knows for sure which way the market will go, the following unstoppable stocks for 2024 could just be market movers for your portfolio. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (NYSE: [PLTR](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/pltr-stock-quote/)) was actually one stock to successfully capitalize on Big Data. They began to capitalize on the Big Data trend a few years ago, first for the government and later for the private sector. Big Data was the trend a few years ago that would reshape the future for business. It promised to transform trillions of bits of data into actionable information for companies. Although it didn’t quite work out that way, we’re seeing the same potential with artificial intelligence (AI), which is like Big Data on steroids. Consequently, the company is now using AI to go even further, launching its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) to [speed workflows to customers](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4646470-palantir-technologies-inc-pltr-q3-2023-earnings-call-transcript'). It now takes just days to analyze data when it used to take two to three months. As a result, customers are flocking to Palantir. Commercial customers grew 37% to 181, boosting revenue 23% higher year-over-year. Government sales jumped 12% in the same period. Unsurprisingly, it’s also profitable now for the first time on a trailing 12-month basis. As a result, analysts already see it as “the [best pure-play](https://investorplace.com/2023/12/the-next-nvda-3-ai-stocks-the-gurus-are-buying-hand-over-fist/) AI name.” There’s talk that the AI-rally might crash next year. Yet demand is still high and Palantir Technologies is the one to capitalize on it. SoFi Technologies (SOFI) When SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: [SOFI](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/sofi-stock-quote/)) went public in 2021, it brought with it a good deal of hype and hope. But it was primed to fall with a sky-high valuation, no profits, and a business model structured on several shaky pillars. And it fell hard. While the stock began trading at $20 a share and raced up to over $25, it has been on a long slide lower ever since. Shares fell to around $4 earlier this year. However, it is on its way back, now trading above $10 a stub. There’s good reason to believe 2024 could see the fintech stock soar. The Federal Reserve paused its aggressive rate hike policy and Chairman Jay Powell even hinted at possible rate cuts next year. Additionally, student loan [repayments have begun](https://investorplace.com/2023/12/why-sofi-stock-looks-like-excellent-value-heading-into-2024/) while loan originations soar. In fact, they doubled last quarter from the year-ago period to $919 million. Home loans were 64% higher. As a result, SoFi is putting together successive quarters of record sales and adjusted profitability. Its native digital platform helps users navigate a cradle-to-grave ecosystem. A borrower might take out a student loan first, turn to SoFi for a mortgage to buy a home afterward, and then tap one of its personal lines of credit to finance big-ticket purchases. With that said, SoFi Technologies is a riskier investment. Total household debt in the U.S. is at an [all-time high](https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc) of $17.3 trillion as mortgage, credit card, and student loan debt piled higher. And a recession could topple SoFi’s stock again. And it doesn’t have much of a competitive moat. Still, macroeconomic indicators are moving in SoFi Technologies’ favor suggesting it it could make the next leg of growth a significant one higher. Tilray Brands (TLRY) While marijuana legalization is moving at a glacial pace in the U.S., the switch is gaining speed elsewhere around the world. That should boost Tilray Brands (NASDAQ: [TLRY](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/tlry-stock-quote/)) potential because it has a global footprint ready to take advantage of the opportunities. Notably, Germany is [poised to legalize pot](https://investorplace.com/2023/12/3-small-cap-stocks-to-scoop-up-before-the-new-year/) early next year. Both Tilray’s international operations and its Aphria RX facility are located there. Ukraine just legalized marijuana, and U.K.-based [Prohibition Partners](https://hightimes.com/business/new-report-projects-global-recreational-cannabis-market-to-nearly-double-by-2027/) estimates the global marijuana market can hit $50 billion by 2027. Still, the U.S. remains the biggest market opportunity for the company. And Tilray won’t realize its full potential until that nut is cracked. It’s moving slowly, but President Biden just expanded the list of pot-related crimes individuals can be pardoned for. The impact is minimal, but it highlights the growing consensus legalization will happen sooner rather than later. Its shares are up 53% from the lows they hit earlier this year. However, they are still down 14% from where they started 2023. It trades at just a fraction of its book value making it a cheap stock with a lot of potential to soar in 2024.

    "title": "Rose & Rye's flaky, golden nazook for Armenian Christmas trace a story of diaspora - Los Angeles Times",
    "text": "In her family’s Granada Hills kitchen, Kristine Jingozian, one of the founders of Rose & Rye bakery, takes a tray of fresh nazook out of the oven — the flaky, rolled, traditional Armenian pastries that have a butter-and-sugar filling, scented with vanilla and burnished golden on top. Brown paper boxes would be neatly filled with nazook by the half and full dozen in preparation for the weekend of Armenian Christmas, which takes place on Saturday, when families share sweets with relatives to celebrate the holiday.\nWhile the batch is cooling, Jingozian starts to roll delicate gel-like rose “delights” into sticks and arrange them along with walnuts onto rounds of dough that she shapes into crescents, called lokumlu — in high demand for Armenian Christmas Eve, to drink with cups of tea.\nThe flavors of L.A. meets Armenia: Rose & Rye’s nazook with fillings such as classic vanilla, strawberry matcha, chocolate hazelnut, black sesame matcha, and brandied dates and walnuts. (Mel Melcon/Los Angeles Times) It’s one of the cookies Jingozian recovered from her grandmother’s old book of recipes, which reflect influences from the years she spent in Soviet Armenia, intertwined with her Syrian and Lebanese background.\nAdvertisement “I watched her make lokumlu during my entire childhood. When we decided to add it to the menu, she came and stayed with us, following our every move and making sure we made it properly,” Jingozian recalls.\nLos Angeles is home to one of the largest Armenian communities outside of Armenia, and dozens of bakeries throughout L.A. reflect its tradition of pastry making, culturally connected to Russia, Iran, Lebanon, France and beyond. To be Armenian is to be of many places.\nRose & Rye is the story of one family’s journey of refuge and immigration told through pastries and cakes that so many like the Jingozians adopted during displacement and changing political regimes, theirs perfected by testing hundreds of recipes.\nKristine Jingozian, left, and her sister, Rose Jingozian, started the family bakery with their mom, Karine, re-creating the Armenian pastries of several generations and adding flavors “to incorporate other cultures into our own culture,” Kristine says, “because Rose & Rye is a diasporic project.” (Michael Blackshire / Los Angeles Times) Karine Jingozian started the home bakery in May 2017 with her daughters, Rose and Kristine. From their kitchen they also make Persian halva, Russian layer cakes, borek, pirog shortbread tarts and ashtamali, a cross between two iconic desserts (orange blossom semolina cake layered with thickened cream and pistachios) with flavors and ingredients that root them in California, including local olive oil, mandarinquats, blood oranges, black sesame, strawberries and matcha.\n“I am obsessed with matcha, I drink it everyday so I decided to add it to the traditional nazook,” Kristine says. “It was a way for me to incorporate other cultures into our own culture because Rose & Rye is a diasporic project.\nAdvertisement\nKristine Jingozian brushes matcha black sesame nazook with a final egg wash before they go into the oven. “I am obsessed with matcha,” she says. (Michael Blackshire / Los Angeles Times) “Diasporic food means that it’s not just Armenian: It means that everywhere Armenians went they cooked and it’s Armenian food.”\nThe tangy smell of baked yeasted dough prevails in the sparkling clean kitchen with four ovens placed strategically in different corners, allowing the family of bakers to make their signature cakes and cookies simultaneously.\nThe tidy German-made wooden mill situated on the counter turns grain into flour that Rose & Rye uses in baked goods. When they started their business, the Jingozians set out to work with the Tehachapi Heritage Grain Project, which grows and preserves heirloom organic grains. The project aligned with Rose & Rye’s goal of supporting the local economy and keeping generational traditions alive through food.\nFood\nThe secret to the most delicious jam I’ve ever tasted? Hot, sunny days The style of jam-making comes from Lebanese Syrian preserving traditions. This apricot jam turned out to be another doorway into a culture I was already immersed in, through friends I value as family.\nJune 28, 2023\nFood has always played a significant role in the Jingozian family. Karine grew up with the vivid stories of her great-grandfather, a chef in Iran. He was known for his shakshuka, which Karine re-created for her family. After repatriating to Armenia, her family moved to Siberia and later, in 1988, to the U.S.\nAdvertisement For her 40th birthday, Karine decided to apply to culinary school and convert her passion for cooking into a profession. In 2016, she decided to quit her job as a pastry chef in West Hollywood and bake classic French cakes with Rose. Soon, Kristine, who worked at République, joined her mother and sister with the idea to modernize traditional recipes and make them accessible for others outside her community. That’s how centuries-old nazook received a makeover with hazelnut, chocolate and matcha fillings.\nRose & Rye was meant to be a temporary project, but as the customer base grew, with orders for dozens of nazook and full cakes, the Jingozians expanded the menu.\nThat’s when the Jingozians’ Russian honey cake, medovik, was born. “The only good honey cakes that I tasted were the homemade ones. Store-bought ones were either dry or too sweet or didn’t taste like anything,” Kristine says. So she decided to create a cake based on one from her grandmother’s recipe book as a starting point, but redeveloped with a flour called Rouge de Bordeaux, a hard red French wheat by Tehachapi Heritage Grain Project with a specific nutty taste that enhances the honey flavor.\nFreshly baked, golden brown nazooks are packed carefully into boxes by the half and full dozen. They’re especially popular at Armenian Christmas, when families exchange sweets with relatives. (Michael Blackshire / Los Angeles Times) After six months of trial and error, researching 600 different recipes and an endless stream of YouTube videos, they landed on an ultimate multilayer honey cake with strata of honey sour cream whip and a little golden bee on top.\nThe next project was to revitalize another childhood favorite popular in Armenia and other countries under Soviet rule: the Bird’s Milk Cake with white cream between layers made with Muscovado sugar and covered with a chocolate glaze.\n“The way I describe this cake to non-Armenians or someone who is not from Eastern Europe,” Kristine says, “is that it has the flavors of untoasted s’mores.”\nAdvertisement Weekly pre-orders for pickup at Rose & Rye are booked through its website. Cakes by the slice are available at pop-ups in Los Angeles announced on Instagram.\nFood\n19 dishes from all over the world that blew our minds in 2023 In 2023, work and leisure took our food writers to New York City, Mexico, Italy, France, Tokyo, Thailand and beyond.
