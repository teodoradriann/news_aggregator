    "title": "Pedina donna sul treno poi aggredisce i militari. Arrestato un 36enne",
    "text": "Intervenuti i carabinieri\nAttimi di paura su un treno regionale partito da Pesaro e diretto a Cattolica . Una giovane madre che viaggiava con la propria figlioletta di appena sei anni è stata importunata da un uomo, che ha incominciato ad infastidirla e a seguirla infischiandosene della presenza della minorenne. Temendo per la propria sicurezza e soprattutto per quella della bambina, la madre ha avuto la prontezza di chiamare il 112, raccontando in tempo reale quanto stava accadendo a bordo del convoglio. La chiamata ha immediatamente messo in allerta le forze dell’ordine. Quando il treno è arrivato alla stazione di Cattolica, ad attenderlo al binario c’erano già i carabinieri della Tenenza, affiancati dai colleghi del Radiomobile di Riccione. I militari, con l’aiuto del personale delle Ferrovie, sono saliti a bordo e hanno rapidamente individuato l’uomo segnalato. Alla vista dei carabinieri, il soggetto, un 36enne di origine romena, in Italia senza fissa dimora, ha reagito in modo violento. Ha cercato di sottrarsi al fermo, colpendo i militari con calci e pugni nel tentativo di sfuggire all’arresto. La sua aggressività ha reso necessario un intervento energico da parte delle forze dell’ordine, che sono comunque riuscite a bloccarlo e farlo scendere dal treno. L’uomo è stato arrestato con l’accusa di resistenza e violenza a pubblico ufficiale. Accompagnato in caserma per gli accertamenti di rito, è stato trattenuto in attesa del processo per direttissima, al termine del quale il giudice ha convalidato l’arresto.\n© Riproduzione riservata\nTag dell'articolo",

    "title": "Paul Brennan: The A to Z of the 2023 sporting year",
    "text": "Paul Brennan: The A to Z of the 2023 sporting year\nFrom a Belgian winning in The Crucible to Ronan O’Gara’s expletive-laden team talk, and from Wayne Mardle losing his voice over an insane leg of darts to the Somalian ‘sprinter’ taking almost 22 seconds to run 100 metres, sports editor Paul Brennan recounts the weird and wonderful of the sporting year just passed\nA is for All-Ireland – as in the football variety and the two that Dublin won, the men’s and ladies, and the two that Kerry lost. After 63 games in the men’s Championship, it came down to Kerry against Dublin in the 64th match on Sunday, July 30. Kerry were defending their All-Ireland title; Dublin looking to win the Sam Maguire Cup back for the first time since 2020. Dublin had three men looking to win a record ninth All-Ireland medal; Kerry were desperately trying to get their captain David Clifford up the steps of the Hogan Stand after what had been the toughest summer for himself and his brother Paudie, after the death of their mother, Ellen, two days before the Munster final. A Paul Geaney goal helped Kerry to a 1-4 to 0-6 half time lead; ten minutes after the restart Paddy Small struck for a Dublin goal. Heart in mouth stuff from there to the end but Dublin won by 1–15 to 1–13 and Stephen Cluxton, James McCarthy and Mick Fitzsimons got their ninth Celtic cross.\nA fortnight later Croke Park was awash with green and gold and light and dark blue again as the Kerry and Dublin women met in their All-Ireland final. Kerry had beaten Dublin earlier in the year in the National League, and again in the group stage of the Championship, but the third time wasn’t a charm for the Kingdom. Louise Ni Mhuircheartaigh scored a second half goal for Kerry, but Dublin’s Hannah Tyrell was the best forward on the day, scoring 0-8, and helping the Dubs to a 0-18 to 1-10 victory.\nB is for Brecel – as in Luca Brecel, the reigning World Snooker champion, after the 28-year-old Belgian won the 2023 Championship after defeating four-time champion Mark Selby 18 frames to 15 in the final. In his semi-final win over Si Jiahui, Brecel was 14-5, but fought back to win by 17-15, which is the biggest deficit ever overturned in the World Championship at the Crucible Theatre. After beating Selby in the final on May 1, Brecel became the first player from continental Europe to be crowned snooker’s world champions, and is the first player outside the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and Canada, Ireland to win snooker’s biggest prize.\nC is for Carpark – the somewhat unlikely setting for a verbal bust-up between Rory McIlroy and caddie Joe LaCava at the Ryder Cup in Rome in September. McIlroy and his playing partner Matt Fitzpatrick looked set for a crucial win over Patrick Cantlay and Wyndham Clark to tie the Saturday afternoon foursomes session at 2-2, when Cantlay holed a 43-foot putt on the 18th which sparked wild celebrations by the US players and Cantlay’s caddie LaCava. The Ulsterman still had his 30-footer to halve the match buthe took serious umbrage with the bagman who was still celebrating on McIlroy’s putting line. McIlroy missed his chance, as did Fitzpatrick, which handed the Americans the win, but it didn’t end there. Later that evening as the players left the Marco Simone course, McIlroy was filmed confronting LaCava, with Shane Lowry intervening to calm down his compatriot who was heard shouting “This can’t happen, this can’t happen, it’s a disgrace” as he was bundled into a courtesy car by the burly Offaly man.\nD is for Driver – which is what Max Verstappen is, and a very good one at that. The Belgian-Dutch man won his third consecutive Formula 1 Drivers Championship in 2023, but that barely covers the extent of his dominance across the year. On his way to a successful title defence, the Red Bull Racing driver won 19 times from 22 races, as well as winning four of the six Sprints. More than that, though, he broke or equalled 18 records in Formula 1 racing this year, including most wins (19), most consecutive wins (10), most podiums (21) and most points in a season (575 from 620), many of which were his own records he broke.\nE is for Extra – as in the extra man Kilmacud Crokes had on the pitch for a few seconds at the end of the All-Ireland Club SFC final against Watty Graham’s Glen in January, and that led to a fortnight of appeal and counter-appeal as the winner of the Andy Merrigan Cup remained in dispute. The Dublin and Leinster champions had been leading the January Club final by two points when they sloppily allowed a late substitution on to the field before the player being replaced was off it, all the while as the Derry club team were taking a late ‘45’ from which they had to try to conjure up a game winning goal. Glen failed to find the net, Crokes took the cup home to Kilmacud and then the controversy broke. Glen appealed the rule violation, the GAA ordered a replay, Kilmacud appealed that decision, and just when it seemed as if the thing was going to run into a third week, Glen withdrew from the appeal process, thereby leaving Kilmacud as All-Ireland champions.\nF is for Freak – as in freak accident, which is what claimed the life of ice hockey player Adam Johnson in October. The 29-year-old American was playing for Nottingham Panthers when he was hit in the neck by opposition player Matt Petgrave’s skate during a match against the Sheffield Steelers. Johnson was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead as a result of his injuries, which, the Panthers club described as a freak accident. Minnesota-born Johnson had played for Pittsburgh Penguins in the National Hockey League – among several other teams – before joining the Panthers in August 2023. In November a man was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and later released on bail.\nG is for GOAT – which, love him or loathe him, is what Novak Djokovic is in the world of tennis. In 2023 the Serb broke the tennis Grand Slam record with 24 titles, winning three of the four big tournaments. He started the year by winning a record-extending 10th Australian Open title that tied with with Rafa Nadal record of 22 men's singles major titles. At the French Open, he beat Casper Ruud in the final, securing a record-breaking 23rd major title and becoming the first man in tennis history to achieve a triple Career Grand Slam. In July he reached but lost the final at Wimbledon, a defeat that end his 34-match winning streak at Wimbledon since 2018, but in September he beat Daniil Medvedev in the US Open final to win a record-extending 24th men's singles major title, equalling Margaret Court's all-time record of major singles titles by either sex. He also became the first man to win three majors in a season four times. He remains a stubborn goat, but is the GOAT nonetheless.\nH is for Humiliation – as in that inflicted by Liverpool Football Club on Manchester United Football Club on Sunday, March 5 at Anfield. Cody Gakpo 43rd minute, Darwin Núñez (47), Gakpo (50), Mohamed Salah (66), Núñez (75), Salah (83) and Roberto Firmino (88) scored the goal to make it the biggest win in the history of the fixture, surpassing Liverpool’s 7-1 victory in the 1895-96 Second Division. Nothing more to be said.\nI is for Insane – which is how Wayne Mardle described one leg of darts at the start of the year – probably the most incredible leg of darts ever. The date was January 3, the occasion the PDC World Championship final, no less. The men on the arrows are Michael van Gerwen and Michael Smith, two of the best – and fastest – players in the world. Up in the commentary box are Stuart Pyke and Mardle. On his first visit MvG fires a maximum 180, followed in equally quick time by a maximum from Smith. Van Gerwen comes again and lands two treble 20s and switches to a treble 19.\n“They may both be on nines…” Mardle says, his voice rising an octave, as Smith returns to land three more in the treble 20 bed.\n“Michael may miss and Michael may hit… they’re both on nines… they’re both on a nine!” This is insane!” Come on now!”\nVan Gerwen is on the oche again, on a 144 finish for what would be only the second nine-darter in a World Championship final.\n“Wow, the world championship final. Michael van Gerwen is on a nine-darter…,” says Pyke, his voice rising, just as the Dutchman lands two 60s smack bang in the middle of the bed, “…in the world final but just misses double-twelve. Over to you, Michael Smith.”\nMardle: “One man misses, does the other man get? I’ve never seen the like. Come on Bully Boy…”\nSmith nails treble 20, and then treble 19.\n“Yeesss… double twelve…” Mardle roars as Smith obliges and turns and raises his fist in celebration to the Ally Pally crowd.\n“That is the most amazing leg of darts you will ever see in your life,” screams Mardle, before channelling the former rugby league player-turned-commentator Mick Morgan, who had roared “I can’t spake! I can’t spake!” while commentating on the 1994 Regal Trophy final between his own Castleford against Wigan and a perceived poor decision by the referee.\nThe thing is, Mardle wasn’t lying, he couldn’t speak after that. He suffered a sore throat and couldn’t finish his commentary of the final, but left us with an unforgettable soundtrack to an unforgettable leg of darts.\nJ is for Jump Shot – as in a fairly routine fall-away jump-shot LeBron James drained for the LA Lakers against Oklahoma City Thunder in the third quarter of their game on Tuesday, February 8. The significance? That basket took the LA Lakers legend to 38,388 points scored in the NBA, which was one more than the legendary Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had scored over his 20-year career, the majority of which was spent at the Lakers. That put James as the NBA’s all-time leading points scorer, which he has since added to, and the target now is to break the 40,000-points barrier. And lest there be any doubt about the enormity of the achievement, the game was stopped for some 10 minutes as members of James’ family, including his mother, wife and three children, took the floor for a ceremony to recognise history being made. America, eh.\nK is for Kiss – as in the one Luis Rubiales planted on Jenni Hermoso on August 20, although it was less a kiss and more a very distasteful act by the then president of the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) on the Spain player after the Women's World Cup final. Spain had just beaten England in the World Cup final in Sydney, but the post-match celebrations were completely overshadowed by Rubiales’ wholly inappropriate behaviour which started with him grabbing his crotch while standing alongside Spain’s Queen Letizia and 16-year-old Princess Infanta Sofia in a VIP box, before he then ‘kissed’ Hermoso on the lips during the trophy presentation. Hermoso said the kiss was not consensual and, after a long-running saga, which included Rubiales’ mother going on a brief hunger strike, the head of the Spanish FA eventually – and begrudgingly – resigned and was subsequently banned by FIFA from all football-related activity for three years.\nL is for LIV – the breakaway Saudi-backed golf tour that is the gift that keeps on giving – or taking, depending on what side of the green you’re on. Tensions between the established PGA Tour and DP World (European) Tour with LIV Golf continued in 2023 with several more players ‘defecting’ to the new PIF-funded golf tour, none bigger than Jon Rahm going over to the dark side in November. In Rahm, the reigning Masters champion said: “I’ve never played the game of golf for monetary reasons. I play for the love of the game and I want to play against the best in the world. I’ve always been interested in history and legacy and right now the PGA Tour has that.” By November the Spaniard had changed his tune. Perhaps a €400 million contract had something to do with the volte-face.\nM is for Manager – in particular Stephen Kenny and Vera Pauw, who in the year just gone became ex-managers. The former came into 2023 already under pressure as manager of the Republic of Ireland men’s soccer team, with a string of poor results already putting Kenny and his team on the back foot as the 2024 Euros qualifying campaign loomed in March. A 1-0 home defeat to France wasn’t altogether unexpected, but a 2-1 loss away to Greece in the second game already suggested qualification of any type would be a struggle. By November is was all over, Ireland only managing to beat Gibraltar twice and Kenny out of the job. For Pauw, the end was just as ignominious. Having reached a zenith with the Republic of Ireland women’s team by qualifying them for the 2023 World Cup in Australia, the team lost to Australia and Canada, before earning a redundant draw and point against Nigeria, and player-manager relations began to unravel before the tournament was even over. By the end of August, the FAI decided they wouldn’t be offering Pauw a new contract.\nN is for Nasra – or to give her her full name, Nasra Abubakar Ali. An unfamiliar name in the world of athletics, the 19-year-old university student from Somali shot to fame (or infamy) when she competed in the 100-metre race at the XXXI FISU World University Games in Chengdu, China. Nothing unusual in that, nor in the fact she came last of the eight runners – someone has to bring up the rear. No, the problem was that Abubakar Ali took 21.81 seconds to run the 100 metres, almost twice as long as the winning time of 11.4 seconds. The bigger problem was that Abukar Ali couldn’t really run at all, and even worse was the claim that she is the niece of Asha Adan Dahir, who was deputy head of delegation for Somalia at the World University Games. Cue embarrassment followed by uproar in Somalia, with the country’s Sports Minister Mohamed Barre Mohamud declaring an investigation into Ali's selection had been launched, saying Dahir has 'engaged in acts of abuse of power, nepotism, and defaming the name of the nation'. A controversy that, no doubt, ran and ran in the African country for some time.\nO is for Obituaries – as in the many that were penned in the last twelve months for some of the great names of the sporting world who died, some at a fine old age, and others much too young. To name but a few of those who passed away: Liam Kearns (GAA), Bobby Charlton (soccer), Syd Millar (rugby), Craig Breen (motorsport), Dick Fosbury (athletics), Teddy McCarthy (GAA), Gianluca Vialli (soccer), John Motson (broadcasting), Rosemary Smith (motorsport), Paudie Palmer (broadcasting), Terry Venables (soccer) and Tom Long (GAA).\nP is for Protests – as in the ones that delayed the Aintree Grand National in April by almost 15 minutes as supporters of the campaign group Animal Rising tried to scale perimeter fences to the racecourse and others managed to get to some of the fences to which at least people attached themselves using glue and locks. They were the first major disruptions to the race since the 1993 National was cancelled because of a series of false starts and the 1997 edition was cancelled due to the IRA bomb threat. The Merseyside Police made 118 arrests for both \"criminal damage and public nuisance offences. When it did get running, the National was won by Corach Rambler, trained by Lucinda Russell in Scotland and ridden by Irish jockey Derek Fox.\nQ is for Quarter-final – as in the the one the Ireland rugby team is incapable of getting beyond at a Rugby World Cup. In sport, it’s often the hope that kills you, but the Ireland players and management, and the Irish public, had probably more hope than ever before of doing well, really well, in France, and with some justification. A Six Nations Gram Slam was won in the spring, and Andy Farrell’s team bounced into the World Cup as the no.1 ranked team in the world. There, a group stage win over South Africa helped set Ireland up for a quarter-final against a New Zealand team not playing particularly well. Danger here, then, as Mr Hamilton might say. Johnny Sexton, Peter O’Mahony et all died with their boots on against the All Blacks, but the dream died too after a 28-24 loss. Another World Cup quarter-final exit for the Guys in Green. As they say in Paris: plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose.\nR is for Redemption – which is what Katie Taylor – sorry, magnificent Katie Taylor – found in late November in front of a partisan Irish crowd at Dublin’s 3Arena when she beat Chantelle Cameron on points in an epic fight to reclaim the world super-lightweight title and re-install the Wicklow woman as the undisputed champion at two weight divisions at the same time. In March, Taylor took on Cameron for the English woman’s undisputed super-lightweight titles. The contest was the first time Katie fought professionally in Ireland as she looked to become a two-weight undisputed world champion. Taylor lost by a majority decision. It seemed, to many, the end of the then 26-year-old Bray boxer. Not so fast. Six months later the pair were back in the ring, with Taylor rediscovering her old form and courage, winning by a majority decision, and setting up a possible Taylor v Cameron III in Croke Park.\nS is for Slipped – as in just slipped back in, which is what Stephen Cluxton did at the end of March when the Dublin football team goalkeeper ran out on to the Croke Park pitch after a more than two-year absence. Cluxton – unquestionably the greatest goalkeeper in GAA history – hadn’t featured for Dublin since the 2020 All-Ireland final win over Mayo, and while he had never officially retired, no one really countenanced a return to the Boys in Blue, until… At the end of March Cluxton casually jogged out with the Dublin team for their Allianz football league game against Louth at Croke Park, with everybody needing to look twice to be sure. He didn’t play that day, but a month later he was back in the starting team, playing against Louth in the Leinster SFC semi-final. Three months later the 41-year-old was an All-Ireland Championship winner again – his ninth – and in November he won his seventh All Star, the oldest male Gaelic footballer or hurler to win an All Star.\nT is for Timed Out – an obscure rule of cricket that is rarely enforced at any level, and certainly never at Test level in international cricket. But in early November – at the World Cup, no less – Angelo Mathews became the first player in 146 years of international cricket to be “timed out”. It happened in the group stage game between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in Delhi when, in the 25th over, Sri Lankan batsman Mathews came to the crease. Realising his helmet was damaged, Mathews called for a replacement and waited. World Cup regulations stipulate a batter must be ‘ready to receive the ball’ within two minutes of the fall of the previous wicket. When two minutes had elapsed, Bangladesh bowler Shakib Al Hasan appealed to the umpire for a time-out. So unprecedented was the request that umpire Marais Erasmus asked Al Hasan twice if he really wanted to appeal. When the bowler said yes, there was little choice but to dismiss Mathews for a duck, who was incandescent with rage and called Al Hasan “disgraceful”. Shakib said: “I was at war and I had to take a decision to make sure my team wins. Right or wrong, there will be debates. But if it is in the rules I don’t mind taking those chances.”\nU is for Unbelievable – which is what Paudie Clifford’s speech at the end of the All-Ireland Club Junior Football final was in January, in every sense. Fossa had just done the unimaginable, winning an All-Ireland title in Croke Park, in a temperamental game against Stewartstown Harps from Tyrone. Paudie and his brother David were both sent off near the end of the game – Stewartstown finished the game with just 11 players on the field – and Paudie had some justification for his annoyance as he received the cup with a bloodied mouth after receiving a cheap shot elbow to the face from an opponent.\n“To the referee and his officials… obviously a very tough game there to ref at the end… a good job other than [at] the end when I was wrongly sent off,” the Fossa captain said, shaking his head in disbelief. “Unbelievable how I was sent off… but a great job all round.”\nPerhaps the Fossa and Kerry forward was a little miffed at GAA President Larry McCarthy presenting the cup to “Paudie Fitzgerald” as he called him. Nevertheless, there was kind words for all the Croke Park staff, the Fossa management and supporters, Johnny the bus driver – and even the Stewartstown players – in a Hogan Stand acceptance speech that was, well, unbelievable.\nV is for Vondrousova – as in Marketa Vondrousova. Who, you might ask? Well, for all but the ardent tennis aficionados, Vondrousova is – or was until July – a little known Czech who just happened to make history as the first unseeded women’s singles champion at Wimbledon. She had reached and lost the French Open final in 2019, but eight months before this summer’s Wimbledon tournament the 24-year-old was ranked outside the world’s top 100. She came to SW19 in July ranked no.42 but unseeded, and went on to beat Ons Jabeur in straight sets in the final, becoming the first unseeded ladies' singles champion in the Open Era. By mid-July she entered the top 10 in the WTA rankings.\nW is for Walk Off – which is essentially what a raft of BBC sports presenters did in solidarity with Match of the Day host Gary Linekar who was, as the BBC announced, “step[ping] back from presenting Match of the Day until we’ve got an agreed and clear position on his use of social media” after the former England striker had become embroiled in a dispute over a tweet he posted in response to the British Home Office announcing the new proposed policy – an attempt to stop migrant boats crossing the English Channel from France. Concerns around the BCC and its presenters showing, or not, impartiality on political matters saw Lineker stood down from MOTD, but what followed was a slew of his colleagues – starting with Ian Wright and Alan Shearer – refusing to go on air in Linekar’s absence. A 20-minute pundit-less MOTD aired that Saturday night, while Football Focus and Final Score weren’t broadcast, while 5 Live’s radio coverage was radically altered. Eventually Linekar was reinstated, albeit with all presenters have to promise to adhere to new guidelines around their social media content.\nX is for X-rated – and also for expletives, which is what Ronan O’Gara liberally sprinkled a team talk to his La Rochelle players with in early June. Looking to get his players in the right frame of mind for their Top 14 semi-final. ROG, speaking in his best version of French, and delivered for the most part in his inimitable Cork accent, became an internet sensation as O’Gara fired up his team with the occasion F-bomb thrown in ‘en anglais’ as he’d say himself. “L’opportunité est fucking énorme,” he reminded his players ahead of their game with Bordeaux. “Je m’en fucking fous d’adversaire,” he said, his voice rising, which roughly means “I don’t give a fucking damn about the opposition” in Franco-Corkonian. Anyway, La Rochelle beat Bordeaux 24-13... so fair fucks to ROG.\nY is for Young – which is what Luke Littler is. Very young, in fact, for what he has already achieved as a darts player. Littler is 16 years old (he turns 17 next month) and is the current PDC World Youth Champion. He is also the youngest player to have won a match in the WDF World Darts Championship and he is competing – and winning matches – at the PDC World Darts Championship currently on. Before Christmas the English teenager (though he looks much older) whitewashed former BDO World Champion Christian Kist in the first round, and then beat Andrew Gilding3-1 in round two. He broke two records, one for the highest average for a debutant at the World Darts Championship with a 106.12, and the other for being the youngest winner of a match. He celebrated his win with a doner kebab.\nZ is for ZZZZZ – as in boring and sleep-inducing, which is what Gaelic football became more and more of in 2023. The new inter-county championship format doesn’t scream excitement, and there were only a small handful of really memorable matches across the summer. Club football isn’t a whole lot better, with almost every team playing to a similar style, and not a very open or entertaining one at that. We live in hope that 2024 will bring a better, more watchable brand of football, but with Jim McGuinness back to manage Donegal and Mickey Harte’s controversial move to Derry we won’t hold out breath. Mayo for Sam, anyone? We’ll take another Kerry versus Dublin final in July, thanks.",
